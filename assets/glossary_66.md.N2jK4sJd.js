The story is action-packed and full of unexpected twists and turns. However for me it was not as exciting as the second and third novel, may be because of the fact that it was all action and no feelings. I personally like to see a softer side of D. As much as I love reading all Kikuchi's novels I still don't understand why D enjoys hunting Nobles and protecting humans despite of the fact that humans are always trying to kill him one way or the other. Maybe we'll find out by the end of 17th novel..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for D fans!","review":"This review is for \\"Tale Of The Dead Town\\". I'm not sure why it's being included with the reviews for other Vampire Hunter D novels.I just finished this novel last night. The mystery wasn't quite there like in the earlier novels and I felt the end wasn't quite wrapped up.*Warning Spoiler*The stranger who had visted 200 years earlier was never identified. Also, abandoned city of Nobles was never quite explained. Where did the 2,000 imitation vampires come from? Also, D acts like as if he knew the place was there all along which means he didn't need to investigate in the first place. If I missed it and someone else didn't an explanation is welcome.All in all I have to say that I wasn't dissapointed. Remember, the first Vampire Hunter D novel is hard to live up to. That being said even if this novel was 25% as good as that then it would still be a classic.I'm very happy with my purchase and anyone looking at the reviews has my recomendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good instrument","review":"My son has been using it for over a year with no complain at all.

What stands out on this album, is singer/songwriter Devon's ability to convey emotion through his lyrics. Although signed to a label when Osker band members were still in high school, Devon has the insight of a very matured individual. The music is composed of simple power chords which maintains a consistent tempo throughout the cd. The fluctuations are really in Devon's vocals which change from apathetic to passionate throughout the cd. While Osker fans may be disappoited that there is a more \\"emo\\" feel on the cd, those who take the time to listen to the content will be pleasantly surprised. Its too bad more people won't hear this recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Teacher's Best Friend","review":"This book, and other books in the Take It to Your Seat series is a teacher's best friend.

There are probably games that are already assembled that would do the trick just as well, and they are already put together on heavier stock and ready for use. This one just wasn't worth the time it was going to take me to create the activities after I purchased the book. I think I used one activity and the rest of the book is gathering dust."},{"rating":"2","title":"I beg to differ...","review":"I disagree with the previous review of this album, as this fellow does not know what he's talking about. The cd contains exactly what the title says it contains... which is courtly music of medieval times and the renaissance. Both Spanish Troubadour songs and Renaissance court music are instrumental in nature, by default, for the most part. For two, the renaissance was still going on during the 1600s, when it finally came to an end some time during that century. Remember, Queen Elizabeth I embodied the Renaissance in England, and did not pass on until 1603.The music contained within the cd is accurate from a historical point of view, and very pleasant instrumental music. It is a pity that some do not enjoy the high-brow music that evolved into our modern classical music."},{"rating":"2","title":"well composed","review":"The vivid and fast paced peirol and the poetic brilliance of vidal create an image of times long forgotten and the pieces of lonardi are like waking from a blessedly sleep. Especially the italian works remind me of classical masterpieces like guiseppe verdi's il trovatore. If you like to get to know music of old, and get a clear overall picture of the troubadour and renaissance music, this is a cd to start with. Droardus Trecensis did a fine job on reconstructing old renaissance scriptures and medieval sheet music to bring you back to the times of old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what was expected","review":"This item did not contain what I had hoped. There is mostly instrumental music which is pretty, but, most of the latter tracks are basically the same with variations. The CD's title makes it sound like you are buying a good deal of medieval music, but in fact, only the first few tracks are medieval, 12th century in fact, while all the other pieces are 17th century and up, which is post renaissance and well nigh into the classical period. Only the first 5 tracks or so are what you bought the CD for.In my opinion, if you are looking for medieval music, this is not the CD for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charlie White","review":"Not the same product as the one offered seasonally at Christmas...different bottle, different smell.

In fact, so many I quit reading halfway through the book. Did anybody see the 60 Minutes segment about St Martin's Press in Feb. '00? The Editor in Chief admitted to Lelsly Stahl that his publishing company does NO fact checking of any kind, nor any research into the writer's background. This is the same sort of fiction that was done in their G.W. Bush biography, which the company later pulled from distribution.

He says that he became very good friends with a man from New York, but he mets this guy, gets to be pals with him and then the guy from NY dies in the space of just one or two pages. He never even gives a clear understanding of his Thai language skills or the relationship between the Thais and the foriegners. A reader above said that the writing was \\"flawless\\".

Now this book will only confuse you if your not in a C++ programming class. When I was taking a C++ class I found out it really helped out when taken with the class. Some of the other reviewers are right in the part where they say some examples have concepts not yet introduced. However, I found out that if you read over the concept after your teacher has gone over it in class it helps give you a clearer understanding. I would give this book between 4 and 4 1/4 stars if possible, mainly because the text does contain a couple of errors. However, since this book helped me out so much I'll give it a 5. This book even has an introduction to windows programming.

The ABQ play with true passion and commitment in both of these highly Romantic works. By contrast, both the brilliant Leipzig Quartet and the Arditi Quartet recordings of the same pieces are both too cool and detatched, though the program notes on their cds are much more detailed than EMI's. This recording is now hard to find, but it's certainly worth looking for. The ABQ's performances of these pieces are also included on a DG compilation of Berg's music, though I don't know if that recording is the same as this. EMI's sound is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oral-B 9400 Triumph","review":"This is my first electric toothbrush I have ever used or purchased.

It has significantly strengthened my gums. My teeth look and feel cleaner. Definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't beat it!","review":"I love this toothbrush!It cleans all of my teeth individually. The timer on the brush tells me when I have brushed for the recommended time. The brush heads have coloring on them that changes to tell me when it's time to change them and get new ones. The lower button on the brush allows me to change the way the brush pulsates while it is in my mouth brushing my teeth too. Ultimately, I just didn't think I could cause the bristles on the brush to come in contact with my teeth as many times manually as the Oral-B could. My teeth look great and my gums are healthy and don't hurt or bleed. A fully charged brush will stay charged for me for a week of vacation (5 days) brushing 2 (twice daily).Best of luck with yours!

The original model lasted a good 3+ years with heavy use. We bought this model as a replacement, but it lasted not much more than a year. It simply stopped working one day. Judging by the moisture that was getting into the LED screen, I suspected that it suffered a short. Thinking that it was just a defective unit, we went out and bought the same model. This time, it came with two of the power toothbrushes. In less than 6 months use, one of the brushes has already died. It suffered the same problem as the first, with moisture getting inside the brush. One would expect a toothbrush to be waterproof. It's very apparent that these brushes are not. It's a shame because they do a very effective job of cleaning teeth.

The first time I used it, I immediately noticed a difference in how clean my teeth felt. The bottom line is, it just works better than doing it manually. The only turnoff was all the little extras that I figured would be in some way helpful. For instance, the LCD screen; you can't read it while you are brushing and the only worthwhile information presented is the time you've brushed for. Most electric toothbrushes will let you know when you reach 30 second intervals anyway, so I don't really see the point. The different brush modes are nice, but not necessary (and I wonder if they actually do anything more than the standard \\"clean\\" mode). All in all, the purchase was well worth it and highly recommended. For anyone on the fence, save some money and buy a cheaper model with less extras."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud and heavy","review":"I got this new Oral B brush after my last one died in Europe (apparently it was a victim of European voltage differences). I was looking for a while and trying to decide between the Oral B and Sonic Care, which my girlfriend had been using for years. I really liked my old Oral B, and had been using it for about 2 years. So when I saw that this new version had come out, and it had a voltage regulator to support voltages around the world, I thought I was set. It was a big disappointment when I first turned it on. It's got to be one of the loudest toothbrushes out there - sounds like a drill or some other powertool when it's running. It's probably 2-3 times louder than my original Oral B. The other problem is that the handle is much thicker and much heavier than the previous model. I have small hands and found it to be cumbersome to hold, not to mention just too heavy.

It was wearing out so I wanted to try something new. The reviews for the Oral-B were very good so I bought it. Unfortunately, I was disappointed.I guess I should have realized the Oral-B was a rotating motor type toothbrush, and I was used to the tiny sonic pulses from the Sonicare. BIG DIFFERENCE. With the Oral-B, I felt like my mouth was being drilled upon, and my whole head vibrated. The brush head was very large and cumbersome for me.I ended up going to a local store and buying the Sonicare Flexcare, which is not the cheapest one out there, but returned to the sonic pulses and extremely clean feeling after brushing teeth. No head vibrations! Smaller brush head with softer bristles, good for sensitive teeth or gums.In defense of the Oral-B, the toothbrush did clean my teeth well.

Feels a little more comfortable in the hand because it's a little larger in diameter. Another plus is there's less rubber in the handle though it's not slippery at all, making it less likely to smell as funky at the base as the previous models.

It had all the same problems as the first one.Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works wonders!!!","review":"I've been using this toothbrush for several months now and I'm really glad we got them. Before I had the unit, I would have tartar accumulate between my teeth primarily because I drink coffee everyday. So every time I have my dental check up, the cement like buildup has to be removed.Since then, I have seen my dentist twice for regular checkups and I should say that she's trying to figure out how she can charge me more with other dental works or try to look like she's breaking a sweat cleaning my teeth (hahaha). With regular use, your teeth is tartar free guaranteed.One good thing also is that the unit has a 2 minute timer that informs you when you should be done with cleaning. It also has 4 brushing modes CLEAN, SOFT, MASSAGE, POLISH.Great great product!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"After two months my teeth do seem cleaner, if not whiter. I would like it if they offered firmer bristles and/or more intense gum massage. Overall a great product that is easy to use. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oral-B Triumphant","review":"This is probably the best tool for dental prophylaxis that I have ever owned. Its instructions are easy to follow, the timing signals for each cleaning are immensely helpful, and so is the warning that it is time to change brushes. My dentist approves. It is well worth the price. A cleric/educator I once knew many years ago cited electric toothbrushes as the heighth of consumer laziness, but I find this product a real help to my dental health."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Gift","review":"I use a 5 year old oral-b product. My girlfriend however was using the standard toothbrush. I eventually bought the 9400 for her and she loves it. The first time she used it she said, \\"my teeth feel so much cleaner.\\" Other then as a gift, I don't have any user experience with the 9400."},{"rating":"2","title":"good product","review":"This is a great toothbrush. My new dental hygenist recommended it. The dental office was selling a fancier version for $100.00 but this one is sufficient. The only thing it doesn't need is the cover for the brushes as the surface under the toothbrushes began to smell musty from no air flow within the first week. I just removed it permanently."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great toothbrush","review":"I just got this for Christmas, so I'm still getting used to it. It is easy to use. I like that it has a covered compartment for the different toothbrush heads. There is a 'soft' speed, but I wish it was a little more gentle. Overall, this is a great toothbrush. It came with the flossing head and the polishing head and I also got a pack of the regular heads. The flossing head was a little harsh, I was scared to use it on my front teeth, but the regular heads worked fine. If you are planning on purchasing this particular toothbrush, I suggest picking up a pack of the 'Oral-B EB17 Flexisoft' heads as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great when it worked","review":"This was a great toothbrush while it worked. I've only had this tooth brush for 4 months and the handle now out of control. It just wouldn't shut off one day. I finally realized if you put it back in the charger is shuts down. It now won't turn back on. I'm going to try and get a replacement but I don't have much confidence in the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding tooth brush","review":"The best product I invested in.

But after using it for a month or so, I feel like the sonicare was better for my teeth. This brush is pretty rough on your teeth--it feels like it's grinding them down when I use it, even though I'm not really even pressing the brush to my teeth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gives you that nice, KLEEN feeling.","review":"After many years of laziness, I've finally bought this power toothbrush. I should have done this long ago. Not only does it do all the work for me, but the built in timer has actually gotten me to brush longer than I used to with any other brush. Floss action head actually gets some of the stuff in-between the teeth too. Not a replacement for flossing, but still nice.Only downside as I see it is the hard plastic that the actual brush is made out of. Every time the back of the brush touches a tooth, I get a very interesting sensation that runs all the way down my spine.Overall, a solid product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oral-B Triumph 9400 Power Toothbrush","review":"The 9400 PC power toothbrush has exceptional power to clean teeth and even polish them as compared to the Sonicare.

We are well pleased with the performance and value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Your mouth will thank you!","review":"I love this toothbrush! I have had problems with my gums for many years and, at a friend's urging, recently switched from a Sonicare to the Oral B 9400. My gums have never felt better. I haven't been to the dentist for a cleaning yet, but I am confident that my results will be obvious and measurable. [I also added a water-pik (Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet) to my dental regimen at the same time, but there's no doubt in my mind that the toothbrush is the major contributor to my success.] Get yourself one of these, your mouth will thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good brush, my dentish recommended","review":"When I went to my dentist every time, she told me I am not brushing my teeth properly. I had 6 fillings last year and a bridge this year. When I asked her, if a electronic brush would help and asked her if Philips sonicare is a good one, she told me I might want to try this one. And voila, this one is great. Though I dont like to flush everyday, I always did with reluctance. But since I started using this brush, I saw I can actually flush once in 2 days.. I like it very much it cleans well, reaches every cornoer of my teeth and though it does not replace flush, it does some of the flush action too. So highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oral Hygiene Empowerment","review":"Wow. Did I say wow? WOW. I am a 48-year old hard core bachelor. Which means I do not always make my bed and usually only brush my teeth once a day, in a hurried fashion.Out of curiousity I recently purchased a $5 agitating toothbrush at the local supermarket....A noticeable improvement from a regular brush.So, I sprung for this version as the price was 50% off retail (and, I noticed the price just went down again...).I can hardly wait to brush my teeth (3x a day). In just two days I can tell my gums are in much better shape and my teeth look like just after a $350 dentist cleaning. Hence the title to my review. I feel empowered that I do not have to subsidize those art deco dental offices with their over-charging for basic services. This should keep me out of the dentist office for a long time. :) Hip, hip, hooray!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than I thought","review":"The toothbrush is loud, slow and the round brush head is not as effective as the regular oblong brush.

I figure it erodes the enamel. As you know tooth enamel once lost does not rebuild. I stopped using the toothbrush around a year back, but my teeth are still sensitive.

Manual brushes are the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome toothbrush but it came with a dent/scratch on lcd screen","review":"This toothbrush is by far the best one yet from oralb. I have used quite a few different models of their automatic rechargeable and battery operated toothbrushes and this one is the best by far.The brush cleans so well that you feel as if you got a professional cleaning from your dentist. My children also love it as it cleans their teeth much better than the manual brushes.I gave it only 4 stars because my unit had a dent/scratch on the lcd screen. It seems as if it got bumped or something internally. It doesnt have any affect on the toothbrush as far as i can see so far but who knows. I was too lazy to return it for a replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"BraunTriumph Pro Care 9400 Oral-B - D25526","review":"This toothbrsh fell way below my expectations; primarily because it came with no added brushes; required what seemed to be a simple assembly but proved difficult. Instructions were very poor. I got a wonderful Oral-B, with three additinal brushes, from COSTCO for $[...] less than this cost. I returned the item to One Stop Shop which shipped the product. To date, this return has not bween reflected on my American WExpress account."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rechargeable Throw Away","review":"I am extremely disappointed in the Braun Triumph 9000. I purchased it on 3/04/2006 and now the battery will not charge. I followed the care instructions and did a discharge every 6 months hoping that the battery would last a little longer, but it still will not charge correctly. I called Braun customer service and explained the problem and was told the handle is no longer good. they said they only last about 5 years. Perhaps Braun should advise the consumer that the unit is going to be disposed of in 5 years. I was offered a $10 dollar coupon or a replacement handle that would cost $60. It is very frustrating to have to purchase another handle when the whole unit costs about $100.(Sam's club) I have to really think about purchasing another Braun brush verses another similar product by another manufacturer. Perhaps I will get more than 5 years out of another company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dentist clean","review":"The other reviews don't lie, this is a great product and I think it works so well.

This is one purchase I will replace immediately if necessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a mouthgasm","review":"I have no idea if a lesser model would be as good. I love this thing. Why didn't all our friends tell us how great it was to get an electric toothbrush. I want to shout at every dentist I do marketing for - hey why didn't you tell me how great electric toothbrushes are. The 2 minute timer, the cleaner mouth, the noticable whiter teeth, all the brush heads - hello we love this thing.And if you are considering an electric toothbrush for the first time, ask yourself if keeping your teeth - your own teeth for life is worth $50-$135?

It definitely gets the job done, and the little stutter at the end of each 30 second period is a great help. It holds a charge a lot longer than brushes I've had in the past, and the visual battery gauge is a nice touch, as is the smiley face given when you completed the brushing. However, you cannot see it when brushing, so until you get used to the sound and feel of each of the three \\"modes\\", it is too easy to slip between them by hitting the second button. The display can tell you which mode you are on, but as you cannot see the display while brushing, you have to learn that a sudden drop in power means you switched modes accidentally, and not that you are low on power. Those are very minor things, however, and should not deter anyone from buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate the ICE alert","review":"When the temp drops below freezing, an alarm sounds and you have to press a button to shut it off.

Its totally useless and ruins the unit.I bought this over the summer and didn't notice this problem until winter. So I'm well past any return timeframe.I'd avoid this unit.

Two very good sequences involve one of the characters' house alarm mysteriously going off, and Michaels' stalking of kids at a Halloween dance. A big plus in helping this book is the fact that the main characters sound like real people. Real kids dealing with real issues. So through that you care about them, which adds to the tension level.

When we leave our 6 stored counties we have to reprogram the next 6 in it.Takes too much preparation. Many times we do not know where we are going when we travel. Would be a little easier if it came with a book of county codes. However we did download and print off the codes for our state.I guess you get what you pay for.

Johanssen looked like a teeny-bopper wearing her mother's clothes . . she appeared so juvenile, so immature in this role that she was an embarrassment to watch.

The acting was so poor. As gorgeous as Johannson is, her lines were awkward and stilted, as if she didn't understand them or the story.An up side to the film were the costumes, pretty prints with heeled Buster Browns.

I must disagree with the reviewers who feel that Helen Hunt was wrong for the part, and that this is NOT a good movie. In the book, her only discretion was having a child at the expense of her Upper Class lover, and then being categorized as a second class woman by High Society. What she did, in not revealing the secret of the play is VERY effective. It brings a tear to the eye. Don't try to turn her into a prostitute crashing into the Upper Class. This play was not the romp of \\"Earnest\\". In my opinion, Wilde closely identified with the character because of his \\"notorious\\" homosexual relationship with Lord Douglas. Is it his best play? NO. Is the movie good, in 2010? YES! It actually has more \\"Wildean\\": quips than the drawing room saga he wrote. The costumes are gorgeous, as is the cast, and Wilde was obsessed with detailing the exact fashions, even fabrics the characters in his plays wear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry movie","review":"I am a big movie fan and especially period pieces but this was a sorry movie! Helen Hunt delivered her lines with less emotion than a waitress behind the counter of Denny's. Her voice tones are great for sarcasm but for meaning and depth lines it stinks.Johansson was as pale as a ghost. Sure she was a very young innocent but she needed some rouge. I also thought she looked downright ugly and dowdy in this movie. Altho the costumes were beautiful she was an ugly ducklying standout.The whole movie lacked the delicate touch and nuance a Wilde story should have. Helen Hunt was the biggest standout as missed casting.

And what's up with that idiotic cover with Stanley on a STONE MOTORCYCLE!!???I have to admit I lost a lot of respect for Stanley as an artist after hearing this abomination, (and it wasn't until hearing 1989's \\"If This Bass Could Only Talk\\" that my respect for Stan as a musician came back in spades). Unfortunnately, \\"Rocks Pebbles and Sand\\" was only the beginning of the long 1980's Schlock-Fest that Stanley would unleash (no doubt at the behest of his record company).Skip this turkey altogether, unless you are a masochist at heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for any baby","review":"I knew when I selected this theme that it was pricey, but I loved the idea of not having a nursery that was overtly girl themed.

My professor informed me that this book was hastily written in 6 weeks; sadly, it shows. I'd skip this one as well as Frank Lenricchia's \\"Critical Terms for Literary Study\\", which is equally worthless.

This book remains one of the great symptoms of the disease. The story I wanted to hear, that of the rise and fall of the Mafia's \\"First Family,\\" consistently takes a back seat to the author's crackhead theories about the JFK Assassination. In truth, the Marcello Crime Family was not, nor did it behave like a Colombian Drug Cartel.

I tell you, I used this book for a class, sight unseen, because the idea of the series was brilliant. Thankfully, I used the real texts (Loeb Classical) as well, and was able to see (1) how bad the translations are in places (reads like the NIV, hmmmmm, wonder why) and (2) how unrepresentative of so many of the views of the Patristic writers on many of the issues this commentary is. You want examples? No space here, fortunately. The only thing less instructive about these idealogically-driven books is my rambling critique of them.

The film suffers and simultaneously benefits from the dichotomy of being the movie that allows Eugene Hutz's fans a more intimate look at his beginnings and being a venue for the filmmaker to get back into Hutz's life. In offering a more personal view and explaining her stake in the story, Pavla Fleischer manages to show how charismatic Hutz is but she is ultimately unable to provide any deeper insight into her main subject because she is too busy moping around about not becoming his love interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but not great.","review":"This is a good doc if youre a die hard Gogol Bordello fan but in the end the filmmaker has personal issues while filming and it detracts it from being a great film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks.

It is a unique, slightly dated, perspective on Japanese culture by a Japanese novelist / philosopher. I say dated because he literally talks about Japanese culture in a time of no electricity and makes several near-racist speculations. But it is a great account of the time and an important transitional phase that Japanese culture undertook: the period of Westernization.It is enlightening to read as you will find yourself agreeing with many things, such as: why are western bathrooms so well lit? Why are we so carefree in our use of electricity and light when it is not only wasteful but can actively make spaces and objects ugly?--I know that's abstract, but that's why you should read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Had Japan developed its own science in harmony withDDD","review":"Writing almost 70 years ago, Tanizaki put great value on an unique sense of beauty in Japan and regretted that it was disappearing as poeple were trying to follow the Western way of life.

So you have time to work out and party on the money that your husband made (or stole) but you don't have time for him? Wow.

I also purchased the book on which it was based (\\"Rocket Boys\\") and \\"The Coalwood Way,\\" the memoir of Homer Hickam, the author, and asked my sister to have my nephew read the story before watching the DVD. I sent the books to my nephew before having a chance to read them myself.This story is a great illustration of what you can achieve if you have the determination to see your dreams through. It should be required viewing for those still working toward their careers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the greatest, but still pretty good","review":"Okay, let me start out by saying that this is a GREAT film for anyone who has a dream that everyone thinks is crazy-it is truly inspiring.

Then this movie is for you. I first watched the rental and I was deeply touched and inspired by it. I right away decided that this movie is worth owning, so I bought myself a copy. I don't regret it. Every time I watch it, it makes me re-evaluate my life and inspires me to go after what I value most. It makes me realize that I, too, can do what most people will tell me is impossible.

It is probably one of my top five favorites and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a heartwarming, true to life movie. The characters, language, scenery and incidents are impeccable. Would'nt change a thing. The movie didn't play in my area so I drove about 75 miles to Charleston just to see it and I wasn't disappointed. TWO THUMBS UP!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"I didn't get to watch this movie on the big screen but rented it a week or two after it was released on video and I'm glad I did. This movie is great. It shows that anyone from anywhere can go places in their life if their determined. I'm a 23 year old guy and it definately inspires me. The acting of each person was superb and very touching. When Titanic came out, I didn't cry at the end of the movie but I teared up for this one. It hits home for many people, especially since it is a true story. I cannot believe that this movie was not nominated for any OSCARS. What a shame because this is NOT a movie to pass up. It is very worth the purchase and time to watch. Afterwards, I purchased the book and read it, which is even more indepth and powerful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sincere stories make good movies","review":"Homer hickam's own story of how he literally \\"blasted\\" his way out of a coal mining town and a future of his own digging in the mines, comes alive in this excellent movie.

This movie is a great movie and I recommend it to anyone who has a dream to do something and they think they can't do it. THe boy in this movoe never stoped trying. He even helped out his family when his dad gets hurt in a mining accident and they needed money so he had to take over for his dad in the coal mine.

My Grandfather worked in the Coalwood Mine, my Father was raised in the same conditions and the same area of McDowell County, West Virginia and knows intimately the desire of not wanting to work in the mines. The movie accurately depicts life in the small town of Coalwood and the dreams of its youngsters to leave the area.Excellent story, excellent photography, and excellent plot. A great adaptation of the book.Recommend that if you get the opportunity to visit Coalwood, that you take it. It's in the middle of nowhere --- and the people of the small town are still amazingly proud of it's claim to fame ... The Rocket Boys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"A film with no heroes or villains--just decent people living their lives with dignity and respect for others.

I've seen it 5 or 6 times and every single time I do, it STILL moves me. It is about as inspirational a movie as you could ever find, but it does so in a much more subtle way than a \\"Rah, rah, go Hickory Hoosiers\\" sort of way. Because it's based on a true story, the caption on the box that it will \\"live in your memory forever\\" (or something like that) is dead right. If more moms and dads viewed THIS movie (and others like Billy Elliot) to have their impact on their children portrayed on screen for them--instead of watching most Hollywood and TV trash in which making fun of or talking down to your kids is the theme--I guarantee the influences of TV/Movies would be much more positive in our society than they are. This ain't Leave it Beaver or Brady Bunch CORN either, it's real stuff and it's natural! If you are a parent, or ever will be, watch this movie.

Even more important, this movie brings up many issues which can lead to good discussions between parents and children: struggles with parental authority, sibling rivalry, peer pressure, political rivalry, perseverance against overwhelming odds, dealing with disappointment and more. Watch this movie and talk to your kids afterward! Chris Cooper and Jake Gyllenhaal portray well the struggle many of us have with our parents when our ideas about success don't match. October Sky shows that success not only comes with a lot of struggle, work and disappointment but also with a great deal of love, support and growth. The image of Homer Hickam descending into the mill, but looking up at the sky should serve to inspire any person who wants to try to live their dream -- whether it is to just get along with one's parents, or to visit the stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Sometimes a Dream is Enought to Light Up the Whole Sky\\"","review":"If you are in search of a movie that will capture you heart and allow it to soar, then October Sky is the movie for you. Jake Gyllenhaal (Home Hickam, Jr.) did a phenominal job of portraying a breath taking true character, the REAL Homer Hickam, Jr. His friends O'Dell, Roy Lee and Quinten add the perfect touch of humor and tears while the tension between father and son (Homer vs. Homer) succeeds in making people of all ages relate to a certain time in their life where they had a relationship was not all that it should have been.

It is based on a true story. The plot is good and it keeps you focused on the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie, Poor Video Quality from Amazon Video","review":"The movie is wonderful. But Amazon's video quality was awful. I'm hoping this was an isolated case, as the quality of my other rentals from Amazon Video have been fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Not Just the Story That's Great","review":"Yes, it's a wonderful true story of perseverence and determination, but a good story can only go so far without some strong storytelling skills backing it up. Yes, Chris Cooper was extraordinary as the father, but Jake Gyllenhaal delivers an honest, fresh, and, most importantly, uncynical performance that doesn't attempt to be ironic or clever like many of his contemporaries--rather, he's being true to that time period. The writing is top-notch, providing each main character (and many secondary ones) a scene or two that changes the way we look at these characters (i.e. when Ms. Reilly walks out on Homer, when the principle applauds the efforts of the Rocketboys, when the mother appears emotionless at the news of her husband's possible demise, etc). And director Joe Johnston gives subtle cinematic images that provoke gigantic emotional responses. This is a superb motion picture--and might I add, it's even better than the book on which the film is based."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Perfect Time To Go And Clean My Room","review":"Watching \\"October Sky\\" was an absolute, complete waste of my time.

Then you'll love this one.","review":"I saw this one in the theater after a friend of a friend convinced me to see it with him (he was seeing it for a second time.) After the first ten minutes, I wanted to leave. If you like formulaic and predictable movies that attempt to convince dumb American youth from small, hick towns that they actually have a future beyond their local Wal-Mart or becoming mince-meat in Iraq, then this movie is for you! However, if you like movies that actually challenge you to think, don't waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended","review":"I just barely saw half of this tripe. Why is it tripe? BECAUSE I HAD NO IDEA WHAT IN THE WORLD WAS GOING ON WITH WHAT I SAW! I didn't know who the characters were supposed to be except this kid named Homer, who was only real ambition was to build a rocket and shoot it off at the end of the film. Some plot. I read the book called \\"Rocket Boys\\" and this movie is just an anagram of the book. I didn't care for the book, so why the movie?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Also an excellent business case study!","review":"Don't dismiss this a just another family movie, consider it also a professional development film for adults!

But what really inspired me to buy and view this movie was when I learned the location of where it was filmed -- my hometown of Oliver Springs, TN.The plot deals with a coal mining town in West Virginia. But, for the film, they chose Oliver Springs. It, too, has always been a coal mining town until the mine was stopped in the late 1970's. But it's an historic place and my heart swelled with emotion as I recognized the features/buildings of where I spent my teen years.But even if the film had been made in Canada, it still deserves watching because it's a family film, dealing with life choices that each of us makes."},{"rating":"2","title":"October Sky","review":"Purchased this video for my grandson, who is reading the book, so he could have a greater understanding of the story and the book.

The (true) story was interesting enough, but the film followed that same pattern we've all seen a hundred times before: poor boy from a dying town has a dream, and with the help of that one special teacher who makes him believe in himself, he overcomes all sorts of adversity to convince himself, his town, and of course the requisite father who Just Doesn't Understand that he can REALLY BE SOMEBODY. Of course, he triumphs in the end. Not bad, just unoriginal. Instead of this movie, try 'This Boy's Life,' a much better adaption of T.S. Eliot's autobiography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surely deserved better marketing when released.","review":"Hopefully someone from the studio reads these things because after seeing this film i wonder who the marketing genius was who failed to adequately promote such a wonderful movie. If there ever was a film that today's kids need to see, this is the one. In the year of the return of mindless slasher films this movie shows that a good story can make a great movie.

There were even a couple of moist eyes at the end. A film that hits that close to the mark is truly art, not just another shoot-em up with some sex and violence thrown in so it can scrape by at the box office.

There's way too much power. The lowest setting sends ingredients flying everywhere.

The scraping spatula also doesn't work well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid if You Need Low Speed","review":"I've owned a Black and Decker hand mixer (called Spatula Smart when I bought mine) for about 15 years. It's obviously held up and worked ok, but I would never recommend it. There is no low speed. Things fly all over the kitchen when you're beating puddings, liquids or even folding in flour. I even bought a bowl with a fitted cover that the beaters go down inside to try and keep the ingredients from flinging all over. It didn't help much. My beaters are rusting on the tops and bottoms! Rust in my food? I think not. The motor is finally dying from whirring around so fast. While I would say that it's lasted a long time, I'd never, ever recommend it or buy another like it. I should've taken it back right after I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy mixer","review":"We replaced a cheap $10 Proctor Silex mixer with this Black & Decker model that was suppose to be an upgrade. What a mistake this was as the mixer did not even last a year of use. I find it humorous that they give you heavy duty beaters and motor with power boost and then use PLASTIC gears! I took the unit apart as soon as I heard the grinding sounds coming from it and sure enough the gears had warn a thin line down the center of them rendering the mixer worthless. What is amazing to me is the cheap Proctor Silex mixer had worked for 5 years doing the same job without breaking, we ended up donating it at the end but still working as good as new. The only reason we upgraded was to get some of the fancier features this model had, now we need to buy a new mixer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too fast","review":"I'm very disappointed with this mixer. I just got it out of the box to use it for the first time.

What a mess!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beaters break and cost $20 to replace","review":"Have had an earlier version of this mixer for 6 years but probably only used it 10 times. The beaters came apart just like the other reviewer with this NEWER model. If you go to Black and Decker's website you will get redirected twice and wind up at someone called \\"Fox\\". If you call them you will find replacement beaters cost $20 a pair. I am very saddened by the fact that the original black and decker is now a corrupted shell licensing their name to some cut rate company cranking out junk. How come the greenies yell at us constantly to use paper grocery bags but no one has a problem with filling the landfills up with junk like this thing? Anyway don't bother with it, it is JUNK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible B&D PowerPro mixer","review":"We needed a new mixer and figured we couldn't go wrong with a Black & Decker. As it turns out, we were very wrong in this thinking. This could possibly be the worst mixer ever! Just as others have said, there is NO low speed, you turn this thing on and it throws pieces every where!!! After using this piece of junk you have to change your shirt because you will have food all over it. I think there are two reasons for this- 1. Too fast and 2. Poorly designed beaters. Also, the beaters are made of a heavy gauge wires that don't cut very well and are weak.If you just bought one of these then take it back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I bought this for my daughter's house warming gift and she was in heaven!

It comes with 5 speeds but the lowest is so fast it renders the appliance useless2. There are two beaters included, but neither is appropriate for mixing the normal cake and cookie batter or mashed potatoes. One will wisk (but the speed is too fast for whipping cream) and the other is useless. I could order the proper beaters, but those would cost $20 plus shipping.3. It comes with a scraper attachment, but the scraper is not large enough to be effective, and keeps popping off rendering the dang thing useless.4. Beaters lock in, but frequently come off in the middle of operation.5. I haven't had any experience with the beaters rusting.

As soon as I used it the first time, I wished I'd bought a more nicer, hence more expensive, mixer. The beaters are very thin and I'm fairly certain won't hold up to my frequent use. Forget about using the plastic bowl scraper. It consistenly flies off the beaters. I don't even bother with it anymore. Also, the lowest speed is faster than the fastest speed on my old mixer. This means I have to mix my batters by hand before using the mixer. I've never needed to go higher than speed 1 for a supposedly 10 speed mixer, negating its 10 speeds. I've yet to use the whisks, but they aren't worth having and extra mixer if that is all that ends up being useful on this product.I would not buy this product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO FAST - Everything goes flying","review":"I guess this is a \\"good\\" mixer but not for me.

After all, the subject of altered history is usually intriguing - who wouldn't wonder what the world would be like if the U.S. had stayed out of WWII?Sadly this book is simply a re-hash of the author's rather dull formative years in urban New Jersey, with rather predictable dialogue and plot devices. The usual sort of whiney angst you find in Roth novels, with a focus on lower midde class Jewish family life. Even as a member of the tribe I found the presentation to be cliched and booorrrring.If you like Roth's prior works, by all means buy this one.

Having read my fair share of AH books, thought is was about time I picked this one up to take for a spin. It started off quite well slowly building up to the \\"it can't happen here\\" moment. Just as the suspense begins to build, the book ends with such a poor ending that it ruins all the time and effort the reader put into it. In lay mans terms, the book is like sex w/o the climax that ends abruptly. Kind of pointless and off-putting. This is not really AH but growing up Jewish in New Jersey with a dabbing of AH. The ending pretty much reveals the true nature of the thoughtless nature of the book. As a nitpick, how does the German invasion of Russia end in the same nature even though there is no lend lease to Russia?

It seems that Roth could have used a better editor. It's almost as if he wrote the book in a rush, adding a character when he thought of him/her without bothering with a seamless sense of inevitable plot. The other irritating thing was his habit of explaining and explaining. Granted, some people may not know a lot about the history of the period and the people who made it, but after awhile it seems long winded and even pedantic.

Outline at end of book stated what was fact and what was made up, this was very useful and interesting. The author truly did his research."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary Potential What If","review":"I finished this book wondering how you couldn't make comparisons with todays ultra conservative neocons and the Right wing machine in Roth's America.Told from the perspective of a young Jewish boy in New Jersey, the book recounts what would of happened had Lindburgh and not FDR won the 1940 presidential election.The book is chillingly realistic, and at times also very funny as young Phillip's family is turned upside down by the looming threat of persecution. A book sure to provoke interesting discussions in book clubs,it's tale seems a gentle reminder of all that can happen with the sway of the ballot box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and educational","review":"I don't quite understand why some readers would find the ending problematic. I thought the conclusion was appropriate and logical, with the Roths' family emerging stronger and victorious. The only problem I had with the concluding saga to the fictional Lindberg presidency was that it was presented to the readers about 40 pages before the novel even concludes.In the beginning, the readers were left to wonder whether the Roths' family was being paranoid about the Lindberg's presidency and its plan to subjugate the Jews. There weren't any mention of other Jewish families's anxieties over their fate in America, just the Roth. It wasn't until the latter half of the novel that things started to go wrong for all Jewish families throughout America and they started sharing the fears of the Jews in Hitler's Europe.Some readers might feel that the entire ordeal was concluded too neatly but I thought it was a necessary change after the chaos of the Lindberg presidency."},{"rating":"1","title":"A nice read, nothing spectacular","review":"Roth has been an excellent writer throughout, standing aloof from most American hypes. With this novel he fails quite miserably. He uses a what-if plotline to try and fan some flames in the worries about the US reaction to 9/11. It is a nice read, especially in his personal observations on what anti-Semitism could have led to in the late thirties. Still towards the end things are stretched a little far, leaving me as a reader in doubt whether the book really justifies making so much hypothetical fuss about something that took an entirely different course already so many years ago. The very few observations that translate to today's situation in the US hardly stand. Making the book a fluke in Philip Roths' usual literary standard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting alternative","review":"I have never read any of Phillip Roth's other works, but I saw this one on the rack and I picked it up on a whim. I have always been a big fan of alternate history and WW II, so I figured that this would be right up my alley. I was right. Roth has a great descriptive voice, and you really get a feel for his 1940's era Newark. You also feel for the paranoia that grips the American Jewish community when Lindberg becomes president. I always enjoy a novel that immerses you in the lives of its protagonists, and I really got a feel for the dynamics of the Roth family during this difficult time. While this book doesn't have the sweeping scope or adventure undertones of most alternative history, it is still a worthwhile read for anyone who enjoys that era and the might-have-beens."},{"rating":"1","title":"A let down","review":"I was very excited about reading this book, it has a great premise, but the plot simply didn't deliver. Slow, and difficult to get into."},{"rating":"2","title":"alternative history","review":"Though a bit too long-winded, Roth has built a very strong case for alternative history and alternative realities that touch on culture, politics and the whole concept of humanity. This is more than just a story of 'if the Nazis had won'. It is a remarkablly prescient look into the hearts and minds of a generation or two that unfortunately reflect the divisions we see today in America. This book may become a different but similar reality in the next ten years, given the existing polarization of America and the very distinct possibility of a swing to the far right, that could mirror some of the things that are the essence of this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Well-Written, Interesting Tale Of Alternative History!","review":"Philip Roth has long been one of our leading literary authors and, while The Plot Against America may not be his best work, it is certainly, very well-written, thought-provoking and holds your interest from beginning to end. The basic plot involves a Jewish family's concerns about life in America if, and subsequently when, Charles Lindbergh, is elected president. Roth's character development and narrative skills makes you feel that you are right there living with this family and sharing the fears and turmoil that they are experiencing. The Plot Against America is well worth reading from a literary standpoint as well as from an alternative history perspective. The only factor that keeps me from giving this book a 5-star rating is the ending, which, while satisfacory, I felt was a bit rushed and a bit abrupt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just as poor as last book I read by this author many years ago","review":"Good plot but not developed by concentration of Jewish Faith.I will not be reading anything else by this author ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roth's best","review":"Roth sets up a fiction but with just enough reality to pull you in. The descriptions of Newark NJ at that time were right on."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't get into it from start to finish","review":"I kept thinking I was going to \\"get\\" it, but I never did. I listened to the book on unabridged CD and I thought at one point I got the CDs mixed up because he reveals the whole scoop and then goes back and fills in the gaps. The characters were interesting, but I did not find the story in general interesting... Maybe I just don't get the genre of alternate history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to Pick Up","review":"A good novel should be hard to put down, but this was almost the opposite. It took me much longer to finish this one than most, because reading it could be such a chore. I've never read any other works by Roth, so I wasn't familiar with his style, but he certainly does enjoy his run-on sentences (peppered with long-winded parenthetical asides)--some go on for over a page! Very distracting. Additionally, Roth can be way too over-the-top with his lists, whether it is a listing of 22 characters in the neighborhood, or 48 guests at a dinner party, they can be exhausting.Perhaps it has been too long since I've read classic literature, but between the subject matter and all the great reviews for this book, I thought it would be a real page-turner. It is anything but."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment!","review":"Roth's latest book is based on a clever and interesting idea. However several things contribute to my disappointment with this novel. Philip Roth intrudes into the novel by being the principal character...Philip as a small boy growing up in Newark and his family ...and this device adds nothing and includes a lot of information which is, frankly, boring!Secondly, the plot is totally unbelievable..not because Fascism couldn't happen here, but because the plot line and writing aresimply not convincing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment","review":"This is the first work by this autor I've read and it will likely be the last. Counterfactual history works have grown from \\"rare and difficult to find\\" to \\"can't take two steps without falling over one\\". All things considered, I don't see how this book could begin with such an outstandingly interesting premise to such a miserably uninteresting ending.I'm guessing there was a point to the authors story, but what it was escaped me entirely. Perhaps it was buried in one of his endless paragraph sized sentances or his \\"page of type\\" sized paragraphs. And, mind you, I was trying to enjoy this book!After fastening upon an entirely believeable historical possibility he smothered it with a cast of utterly unbelieveable minor actors who never once behaived realistically.A good story, an interesting idea was lost in four hundred pages of meandering sillyness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great beginning but story completely falls apart at end","review":"I would have given this book 5 stars two weeks ago, but goodness does it blow at the end.The anti-conservatism in the book always bugged me a smidge (it's idiotic to equate Republicans to lukewarm Fascists... that never holds up to an intelligent examination), but I was able to overlook it because of the great storytelling at the outset of the novel.I was involved, I was engrossed, I was excited about reading the next chapter.But then, towards the last third of the book, it's almost as if Roth gives up. The entire novel was used to set up the climax - what would happen to Lindbergh, what would be his downfall... and it happens in an unbelievably understated way in one entire paragraph.Never in my life have I been so disappointed or disgusted with the ending of a book. I wish I had never started it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Portnoy's Complaint meets Lord of the Rings","review":"Easily the worst written novel I've ever made myself read. Somehow Roth has the idea that people enjoy his free associations. His narcissism is legendary (see the famous review of Portnoy by the late, great Bruno Bettelheim).The what-if scenario is intriguing: what would happen if a real, overt anti-semite gets into the White House? Would people respond with all the presumed latent atavistic anti-semitism that Roth imagines? Maybe. But is it worth plowing through endless asides, nearly page-long sentences with numerous asides to get the message?No, it is not.The idea is good. The execution is awful. If he had an editor, that editor should be fired. If he didn't he ought to get one. Jeeeez...how many times is he going to write Portnoy???? Once was enough, already. Do something else, Roth."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of his best!","review":"Philip Roth's writing is interesting for how it depicts Jewish life with irony and humor. I loved his Portnoy's Complaint about this teenager named Alexander who makes all these intimate confessions to his shrink. In this latest novel the Plot Against America we have the frightening \\"what if\\" Charles Lindberg had become president of the United States, beating out FDR. Roth handles this scenario most intelligently and creatively as well as giving us another very human story to carry the narrative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Character character character","review":"This is the third book I have read by this author. After giving up on the first book I tried, Sabbath's Theater, I decided that I would give The Human Stain a try, and that I did finish but it took some dedication. Well, this book faired a bit better. I think his writing style in this book was less heady and more grounded in what is real or what could be real if historical events transpired differently. However, I found that the novel was, at points, too character driven as opposed to the events surrounding the title's suggested premise. While I can say that this book was good, I cannot say that I would recommend it for someone expecting a historically event based novel. I think I am done with Mr. Roth at this point in my life as I know there are other more engaging books to read. Maybe it is because I am not Jewish and did not grow up during WWII, or maybe it is just his writing style. I can't bash this book but I also cannot praise it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eighty percent good","review":"I thouroughly enjoyed the first eighty percent of Roth's new, entertaining and often humourous novel. Roth paints a very detailed portrait of Jewish suburban life in the 1940's and how political events can shape and mould those lives. The rise of Lindbergh and the suburban family chronicle are briliantly interwoven. Then... (not to give away the ending) it just seems like Roth grew tired of writing the book and ended it too abruptly. Gone are the family insights and interweaving of national events and family life. Perhaps Roth couldn't figure out how to end the book, but this reader feels cheated of a meaningful end to a wonderfully told tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting concept but boring book","review":"The concept behind this book is fascinating. The book would be interesting if it were half as long and followed the story of the main characters. Roth spends whole pages running down lists of people who attended various functions, establishing characters who do not contribute to the plot, and otherwise digressing onto every tangent imaginable.It would be far more efficient to just read a few of the reviews here on Amazon. You'll get the gist of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A paranoid's fantasy.","review":"Roth's novel claims if Lindbergh had run for president against the popular FDR in 1940 he would have won in a landslide. Americans would embrace isolationism and fascism. Critics had predicted this premise would generate controversy however reader reviews seem to imply it is plausible. What Americans are we talking about...the generation which defeated fascism in Europe? And a shy, reclusive Lindbergh as president? Perhaps Howard Hughes would have been vice president. It is true that FDR was characterized by the 1940 republican nominee as a warmonger. FDR went on to claim 55% of the popular vote and 449 of 531 electoral votes, defeating the republican, communist and socialist presidential candidates (no, there was no German Bund candidate). As an alternative history Roth's work strains credulity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ready For A Room At Bellevue","review":"WOW! Over the years Roth has dropped little hints of his extreme hatred of non-Jews but now he lets it all hang out. In Roth's world there are only two kinds of people: Good(Jews), Bad(anti-Semites).Roth has shown himself to be nothing more than the mirror image of the late William Pierce, founder of the neo-Nazi group National Alliance. Where Pierce railed against Jews and non-whites, Roth spews-off against \\"rednecks\\" and Catholics. What's really sad is that the cognoscenti hold Roth in high esteem as a champion of American letters.Roth needs to stick to writing quasi-porn, which is what he does best.Save your money folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"DETAILS","review":"When I first read that this book was coming out, with this plot, I thought I would LOVE it. After the first chapter I began to skim the book till I finished. I do not need, no one alive needs, every detail about every thing that is discussed. Page after page after page aboutone stamp....it got to be almost sickening after a few times. This is an alternate history novel, not a book on stamps, and that is what I felt I was reading for at least the first few chapters."},{"rating":"1","title":"To much detail!","review":"great concept, horible aplication. The whole idea, is very interesting, and somwhat historicaly accurit.

The book did open my mind to the fears that the Jewish minority would reasonably have (really, any minority) with a slight shift in electoral politics, but the ending was completely unreal. By the way, the Constitution provides for presidential elections only every 4 years so there is no way that FDR or anyone else would have been elected president in November 1942."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roth's fable makes you think","review":"Philip Roth's widely-acclaimed novel is a brilliant dark fable, perfectly timed for the 350th anniversary of Jewish life in America this year. I think most people know the \\"plot\\"--the nightmare of the fictitious Presidency of the hero aviator and Nazi sympathizer Charles A. Lindbergh in 1940. Among other issues, Roth deals intelligently with the American Jewish sense of being \\"different\\" as well as the themes of accommodation and the core values of being American. This is an important book, and a special gift during this holiday season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fictionized version of history as it's unfolding now","review":"In this excellent book, the what-if line is followed;While entertaining, thought-provoking and credible, it's nothing compared to what's happening right now, in the good ole US of A.In \\"Crossing the Rubicon\\", MIchael C.

Roth doesn't seem to recall that Lindburgh never praised the Nazi regime's racial policies; he did believe that war with Germany was not wise in 1939 and 1940 because we were not close to being ready and that Japan was a much clearer danger. After Pearl Harbor, Lindburgh served on combat duty as a civilian \\"advisor\\" to US Army Air Corps and Navy/Marine Corps units in the South Pacific at the \\"advanced age\\" of 42 when much younger celebrities did bond drives and USO shows. Save your money for better than this collection of tripe attacking a great American."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Choice as a First Roth Pick","review":"I had never read anything by Roth and when I finally got around to him I made the mistake of picking The Plot Against America. I enjoy \\"what if\\" books and found the idea compelling... unfortunately the book is not. It doesn't dare enough in imagining an alternative (and frightening) scenario, it fails at creating suspence and pathos at almost every turn, and it's a slow and disjointed yawn of a book. Characters are mostly very flat and the there are pages and pages of truly useless page fillers... I can't imagine why i would ever want to pick up another book of his.You need to be a genius to act so poorly on such a good idea for a story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting idea overwritten and drawn out","review":"The idea is a very interesting one and presents a very compelling what if. However, the writing style appears to try too hard. The book is well over 350 pages but would be a much better read closer to 200 if much of the nonsense was cut out. The author chooses to use 15 long, runon sentences to explain what many others do in one. There are many rants and meaningless side stories which add to the over abundance of wastes words used. This makes it a more difficult and labor some read when it doesn't need to be. When one is able to sift through the pages long thoughts and cut it down to the nub, one does have an enjoyable story at hand. That is if you have the patience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of Plot Against America by Philip Roth","review":"The Plot Against America by Philip RothI had very mixed emotions about this book. I felt it was very well written. I like seeing it through the eyes of a child. I loved the era-neighbors sitting on their stoops in the summer-everyone knew everyone else. What I found hard to deal with was the prejudice against the Jews, and I am not Jewish by the way. I also had trouble imagining Lindberg as president. I was surprised to learn that Henry Ford had Pro-Hitler leanings. I only gave it 2 stars for the above reasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"a little bit overrated","review":"I would have liked to have given 2.5 stars, but that option not available. Maybe it is just me, but this book could at times be very difficult to read. I personally don't think it is good writing when several thoughts are included in a sentence that sometimes runs the whole page! Many times while reading this book, of which i am admittedly only half through, I would say to myself, \\"what the hell did I just read?\\" and have to go back.The only other time I remember of late reading a book that frustrated me like this was A Man In Full, by Tom Wolfe. My dad loved it and so did many others, but I found it to be extremely annoying the way he forms his thoughts on paper.Maybe this is just not my kind of book....."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Challenge to stay awake.","review":"Frankly, I found this book to be completely boring. The premise was very interesting. I don't think Mr. Roth followed through and gave us what we expected, a truely cruel and despotic American Goverment ran by Nazis. I also find that the plausibility and reasoning behind the plot was lacking. I truthfully believe Roth wrote this book under time constraints, because the development of plot ideas shows it (or he simply lacks imagination). My recommendation is not to waste your time with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"strange plot curve","review":"The first half of the book was pretty boring; I kept waiting for the poo to hit the fan. The third quarter of the book was somewhat compelling, with the horror slowly but surely building in a somewhat believable way. Then things got woo-woo crazy for a few dozen pages.

As an alternate history, it sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bigoted and Badly Written","review":"Phillip Roth has literary ability. We laughed ourselves silly reading Portnoy' Complaint in high school. But this novel is a huge misfortune. Roth's mind seems to have been poisoned by paranoia and fanatical ant-anti-Semitism to believe that America came very close to being just like Hitler's Germany. And the attack on American hero Charles Lindbergh is simply scurrilous, comparing him, bizarrely, to Adolf Hitler. Maybe this piece was motivated by a heartfelt need to defend Zionism against patriots like Pat Buchanan. I don't know. But it doesn't work as fiction (simply bad writing), and as a docu-drama it has no connection with reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"there wasn't a plot against America in this novel","review":"if this were written as a creative writing project it would get an F. As alternative history it isn't any better.The plot of the title was mostly a conflict between 2 political parties. He did invent a plot against Jews that wasn't very believable. There certainly was no plot against America in general.Since the book is partly based on Roth's childhood, he should have just written an autobiography. He could have added his fears of antisemitism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been done to death and much better","review":"As alternate histories go this is, at best, adequate. The only reason it's getting rave reviews is that Roth is \\"Real Literature(tm)\\" as opposed to the plebes who write genre fiction. Others from Phil Dick to Steve Barnes have done alternate history more carefully and thoughtfully. But they are part of the science fiction ghetto and don't get mentioned in the New York Review of Books.That aside, the story has serious weaknesses. If he's trying to take off the gloves and go to war with the forces of latent American fascism he fails. His protagonists don't need to be heroic, but if this is to succeed as a call to action they must be more bitter, impotent blowhards. It's the famous, the Walt Winchells, who are martyred.

Growing up as a Jew in an America that still more or less tolerated a casual sort of anti-semitism, Roth always felt different. Yes, got it.

Yep, sure would have.After about two-thirds the way through, I tossed this book aside.

It is a dark book, no real hero (except if you think the author is)plausible scenario, Lindberg becomes president, sides with Nazi Germany, things become terrible for jewish familes in America.

Not for the masses."},{"rating":"2","title":"what if....?","review":"A Nazi sympathizer and American hero Charles Lindbergh pulls off one of the greatest upsets in presidential election history and winds up beating Roosevelt in the '42 election. This is the story of the Roth family and how they cope with seeing the America that they love and respect go sideways. Kinda reminds me a bit of the 2000 election. This book is tightly written from the youngest child's viewpoint (I think he's around 12 when the book starts) and it just a fascinating re-imagining of faux history and I loved it. Like all of Roths books, the ending is abrupt. When he is done with a book, he ends it. But I'm good with that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roth's most compelling work","review":"A story of Nazism taking hold of the White House and drawing the United States into Germany's vortex during WWII strains credulity, but Roth pieces together his account so delicately and cleverly that the events have an inevitability about them. As the true chronology at the end of the novel shows (drawing upon historical records), the story may well have been more. There are dimensions to the characters of Charles Lindbergh and Henry Ford that history has, to a large degree, kindly overlooked. The prose is beautiful and, while dense and voluble at times, flows so well that reading it is effortless. This must rival \`American Pastoral' as Roth's most compelling work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly disappointing","review":"I was expecting much more from this book.

I worry about it and all forms of racism and meanness. But I think we can address this problem without concocting sick fantasies that are a slap in the face to so many American people, like Philip Roth has done here with this book. A more reasonable and intriguing storyline would have been, \\"What would have happened if the Communists within the Roosevelt government had been discovered and outed in 1944 instead of after the fall of the Soviet Union?\\" I think it's despicable of the author to make such an effort at linking Nazism, Christianity, and rural America. This East Coast elitism doesn't serve anyone, except the REAL enemies of our nation who are REALLY plotting against it. I've never read any of Roth's other stuff. I hope it's better than this trite, repetitive, and frankly ugly book. Hey, it's a free country. Roth can cook up his strange bigoted brew, and I can criticize him for doing it.

Alternative history stories are usually fascinating. However, this book is largely page-after-page a jewish family drama. That is fine, but I found it very boring. The \\"President Lindbergh\\" idea is not the focus. In fact, the book is slow and plodding until the last 50 pages. In these final pages, the most dramatic political intrigue occurs. Yet, there are not enough pages left to fully explore these plot turns, let alone convince the reader they are plausible. The ending of this book felt like an incomplete Cliffs Notes version of another novel. There were no shortage of positive blurbs on the back cover of my paperback, yet this book left me wondering what those critics were thinking when they praised this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Look at What Might Have Been","review":"When I heard that Philip Roth was writing again I got excited, but when I heard his subject I was fascinated. I've been a fan of this time period for many years and loved the notion that so many alternatives presented in such a short period.Lindbergh was worshipped - see Scott Berg's wonderful biography for evidence. It is very plausible that his appeal to the huge number of American isolationists could propel him into office.I suppose that Roth's proposition that this would lead to American pogroms is intentionally provocative, but it had one unintended comfort: it's one of the first things I've ever read that made me feel better about McCartyism.A good read - as always, Roth writes in an energetic, engaged way."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big let down.","review":"I was very disappointed by this novel. Roth is a talented writer, and I had hoped that he would be able to create a truly compelling novel out of such a promising idea. However, the novel just didn't work for me. The characters felt something like cardboard cut outs and seemed inconsistent in their behavior. The plot spun out of control and became completely fantastic and quite unbelievable. Read something else by Roth - I think you'll enjoy one of his earlier works more than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"in the shadow of bush","review":"Roth doesn''t seem to understand the Constitution. I think this is an okay novel, but it is written in the shadow of the 2000 election and 9/11 and I think Roth sees a little bit of Bush in his Charles Lindbergh.The kid's perspective was okay but I needed a little more history. And then the ending just messed everything up. I think he was getting tired of writing. If you want to read a good Roth novel go with \\"portnoy's complaint.\\" If you want good alternative history fiction go elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story, and believable, too.","review":"Plot Against America tells the story of a fascist America led by Charles Lindberg. The plot was well though out, and it definitely makes one think at what could happen had history not happened the way it did. Also, being a native of NJ, having grown up just 10 min from where the story takes place made reading the novel even more enjoyable. The only drawback is the cover of the book. Because I am now living in Austria, the large swastika on the cover made reading the book in public a bit akward..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Start, Bad End","review":"I was hoping for something fresh and entertaining from someone with Roth's reputation. And at first I was not disappointed. But soon it fell into a predictable pseudo-political commentary based on wishes rather than fact. Funny how Lindbergh gradually becomes more sinister, while people like Joe Kennedy are totally missing. There are many more WWII Alternate Histories that provide a more satisfying analysis of both the characters involved and the realities of the time. Harry Turtledove, Robert Harris and Robert Conroy, among others, have produced far better examples of the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book!","review":"I think this is a wonderful book! It brought up so many feelings, with humor and sadness, through the family dynamics as they tried to weather the changes in America. It also expressed the fear I feel for America today, as I watch the far right \\"kidnap\\" my country and try to use the Constitution and the Bill of Rights for their own narrow beliefs. I guess some, whose politics are totally opposite mine, may not find the book so readable, but it is a great read, worth every minute I spent on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it says on the back","review":"I completed this book that I so willingly dropped in the hat at the last minute for our book club. I was all excited to lead the group in discussion and get ahead. I love history and this book really caught my attention.Unfortunately, this book was a struggle to get through and is not that satisfying. The only reason I finished it was my not-very-exciting train ride from Milwaukee to Minneapolis (I had nothing else to do). I also was praying it would get better (it never did!)The writing is terrible. As other reviewers have written, it is full of run-on sentences with tons of commas and dashes. The chapters are long and hard to follow... I found myself having to reread the pages multiple times to figure out what was going on. I cared nothing about any of the characters. The story line is not very interesting... I would not waste your time with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing.","review":"Wow. Hard to believe this isn't history as you read it -- and thank heavens it's not. An amazing look back at a time that could have been, and through the eyes of a child narrator drawn so finely and well. Thank you, Mr. Roth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting","review":"This book may become a different but similar reality in the next ten years, given the existing polarization of America and the very distinct possibility of a swing to the far right, that could mirror some of the things that are the essence of this story. A bit long-winding, other than that it is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Live Up to its Reputation","review":"I thought this book would be more interesting than it was. Admittedly, I bought it thinking it would be more of a political thriller than a character study, and I really wanted to put it down after about 50 pages. I stuck with it, though, and after a while, I began to enjoy the passages devoted to young Philip's story--namely, the story of what overwhelming events and parental fears can do to a child. That part of the book was well done and captivating. Unfortunately, Philip's story gets lost in alot of garbage--holy cow! This book has way too much utterly useless description. At times, I felt like I did when I read Moby Dick in school--I felt as if the interesting story was buried between over-done descriptions of whale blubber."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting mix of politics and family dynamics","review":"Reading \\"Plot Against America\\" as the election wrapped up was a chilling experience. In the novel the Roth family is subjected to a series of ever-more-restrictive policies designed to help them \\"assimiliate\\"--an eerie echo of the anti-gay and xenophobic rhetoric that has shadowed this election and seems to have determined its outcome. Although the political exposition can get a bit eye-glazing at times, Roth is brilliant at viewing that nation's drift toward fascism from a child's perpective: What is most frightening to young Philip is the effect of Lindbergh's policies on relationships within his own family and his insular little world. And like all of Roth's characters, Philip is brought to life by a wonderful pastiche of flaws, encounters and idiosyncratic passions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roth takes another step into post-modernism","review":"Roth plays with post modern concepts in such novels as Operation Shylock, blurring the line between fiction and reality, between character and identity, and in The Plot Against America, he takes yet another post modern bugaboo, and runs with it. This time it is the alternate history, where he re-imagines a facist American in the late 30's and early 40's. Roth seems intent on recapitulating much of 20th century literature. His Zukerman novel's are Marlowesque frame tales, very in keeping with High Literary Modernism, while his books in the late 90's and early 00's dip into the grab bag of post modern tricks. But Roth's strength as a writer (his genius) make these moves seems less shallow then lesser writers. He takes a well worn literary clichés and makes them his own."},{"rating":"2","title":"An entertaining idea bookends some draggy sections","review":"I was totally caught up in the story from the first couple of chapters, and the final couple of chapters blew me away...but things dragged and crept for me in the middle of those experiences. Great idea lovingly executed. Once you're past the first hundred pages or so, take a deep breath and push on quickly to get to the final hundred pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"good start, then a disappointment","review":"Here is the GOOD news about Roth's novel:He has a daring imagination.The dystopian world is not of the future, but of a possible past.Remarkable research.Blend of personal with history.Now the sad, BAD news:The book begins with a young Phil Roth as the narrator. The early scenes--especially when the family goes to Washington DC--are vivid and excellent. However for some unknown reason, Roth drops the first person / youngster view almost totally.The style is often overwritten; it becomes more of an essay than a story. Too much tiresome passive tense.Roth summarizes far too many events, as if he is a distant historian rather than an involved narrator/character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Their Best","review":"\\"Lay It on Me\\" is this CD's best track. It's a bizzare combination of stop and start strings, a gravelly \\"country\\" vocal by Maurice, and lyrics that are way way out there. Funny thing is, it works!Wish I could say that for the rest of the album. Maurice seems to be the only Gibb here who has his heart in this project. Barry, and especially Robin, seem to be calling this one in.The \\"Two Years On\\" refers to a two year period that the band split up. This is one of two albums released in 1971, the other being \\"Trafalgar\\"- also available at Amazon. \\"Trafalgar\\" is far superior, but \\"Two Years On\\" was released first, so for that reason alone, this CD does have a place in Bee Gee history.You don't get a lot of collaborations or trademark Bee Gee harmony here- what you do get is the equivilent of \\"The White Album\\"- each singer takes his turn at the mike. Only difference is, this entire effort is weak.Marginal recommendation at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Track List Japanese Reissue 2004","review":"Track list is the same of US versions:1. 2 Years On2.

But there aren't too many other highlights here. Most of the songs seem to be leftovers from the Brother's unsuccessful and shortlived solo careers. The title track is an exception with Robin apparently recounting his \\"Two Years\\" away from his siblings. The recording itself sounds muddled and not up to the standards even at that time. One of their weaker efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Three Perspectives Reunion","review":"Barry Gibb once mentioned that \\"2 Years On\\" was the weakest album the trio had recorded. True. Granted that it garnered the huge American hit \\"Lonely Days\\", the rest of the album seems like leftovers from their attempts at solo careers. Wince while listening to \\"I'm Weeping\\". Shake your head in bewilderment at \\"Tell Me Why\\". \\"Lay It On Me\\" passes the test, but it seems Maurice shot his entire solo wad on that one. Do note however, that the song \\"2 Years On\\" is a rare early Robin and Maurice collaboration. \\"Man For All Seasons\\" clearly hints at the Gibbs' easily obtained falsettos to come. \\"The 1st Mistake I Made\\" is a surprising success, if a bit long. Strong emotional strings and guitar/piano riffs can't help but 'get you'. Otherwise the remainder of the songs are 'fluff'. This 'fluff' led to a magnificnet album less than a year later.

He also became very successful in the surrounding countries (i. e. Switzerland, Belgium...) with this album. His talent is very unique, his strength is to combine traditional French \\"Chansons\\" kind of melodies with more modern rhythm arrangements (...I think he listened to Madonna's \\"Ray of light\\" album a lot....) and all underlayed by a 50 piece string orchestra. With this album, for the first time, he also experimented a bit with Spanish music, since his ancestors are actually from Spain.... and the sexy rhythms of the title track are just catching you and you just want to dance.... overall, this album is packed with his passion in music, you can hear that as well in his voice! All his previous albums are great too, but still, the highlight of his career is \\"Soledad\\"...."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANOTHER PASSIONATE VOICE","review":"One of my hobbies is collecting foreign music even though I do not fully understand the languages. So-o, I have to rely on my gut feeling, and my ears, when I choose music. One thing I cannot resist are songs sung with passion!Pascal Obispo has just such a singing style. He totally bowled me over. His passion in \\"Par Absence\\" for example, you can't help but pay attention!My favorites (though there are NO losers in the batch): \\"Pas Besoin de Regrets\\"--cool guitar. \\"Soledad\\"--Frenchmen singing in Spanish is a favorite of mine! \\"Si et Seul'ment Seul\\"-seductive musical introduction and intense guitar riffs. \\"Variations sur le meme-tu Manques\\"--SEXY voice, great orchestration and a really catchy beat.

Wow, was I rewarded! I have attended many relationship seminars over the years (and have even taught them) but this presenter got right to the specifics which will immediately make your man take notice and get his favorable attention. The series title suggests that it covers approaches to relationship intimacy. While it does that, it addresses far more than just sex. I was on a trip as I listened to the tapes and when I called my spouse up to talk the first two nights I was away you could hear his jaw drop (and in a good way).

First of all the production is really good and solid. The beats get you to the belly, the horns are really funky and you can hardly help not bouncing your head. The production of the album is a treat and it is in my opinion close to the works of dj Premier or Pete Rock.The second point that really caught me is that Ace's lyrics are on point and original. He manages to develop some conscious lyrics but he does it with humor and avoids being preachy. Ace criticizes the attitude of gangsta rap and it is really refreshing to hear an MC who takes time to think instead of just pretending to be hard.Overall, Slaughtahouse is amazing. It sounds as fresh and tight now as it did in 1993. I consider this album to be Masta Ace's master piece and it definitely can compete in the best Hip Hop albums category."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you Liked Snow Flower and the Secret Fan you will love...","review":"The Ginger tree is a remarable book, well written with a good story line.

She decides to break away from her lover and ends up opening up her own business. I liked this book, but some people may see it as a tough read and give up on it too soon.

The versions chosen of the songs are in general quite excellent. In fact, I am getting married in about a month and we are using several of the songs from this CD in the ceremony. The ONLY real complaint I have about this CD is that there is ENTIRELY too much Pavoratti (sp?) on it. I would have liked a bit more variety in the male singers department. Although I do enjoy Pavoratti in general, there are some songs and parts of songs where he sounds like a cat being dragged around a room (sorry Pavi fans!). Otherwise- EXCELLENT.

I taught Texas inmates for eight years during the recent prison expansion. People were usually surprised when I told them how much I enjoyed teaching inmates. The longer I worked in prison, the more I became concerned about the misinformation, based on fear instead of fact, which the public had been receiving from the news media and politicians. In order for our society to survive, we must stop reacting emotionally and start thinking rationally about solutions which will make a lasting difference in a positive way. Prison expansion in the United States has cost taxpayers millions of dollars for the buildings alone. But the price in human terms is far greater. This book is essential reading for every citizen who is concerned about how our government is spending tax dollars.Lorna Rios"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's About Time: America's Imprisonment Binge","review":"It's hard to rate since it was sent direct to my teen at college.

Other reviewers have discussed details of the live v. recorded performance, Colin v. Michael debate, etc., none of which I feel qualified to add to, so I will focus on what stands out for my family. What had stuck in our minds the most from our TV viewing was the fabulous tap duel between the newly arrived Irish immigrants and the streetwise New York natives. Our collective memory did not play us false; it is truly a dynamite number. One terrific piece I had not remembered (maybe it wasn't on TV?) was the fiddle solo. I even got inspired enough by seeing this again to order tickets to a live production coming our way early next year! The reason this gets 4 stars instead of 5 is that the kids find some of the singing and slower dance numbers boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the VHS Version -- Don't Buy This DVD","review":"Both the sound and video quality of the VHS version are superior to the DVD product. This DVD was so poorly done that they couldn't even get it all on one disk surface, requiring that you turn the disk over for Act 2. The whole show is less than the length of a typical movie. (Even \\"Gone with the Wind\\" doesn't require turning over the disk!) VERY badly done, and worth boycotting as a product unworthy of the excellence of the show itself. I'm sorry I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not Buy this DVD for the picture quality","review":"The dancing is Great, but this DVD should have never been released as a Super Bit DVD! Do not watch it on anything larger than a 31 inch TV. First, it is not a 16:9 anamorphicaly enhanced DVD as are the other Super Bit releases, and as marked on the package. It is only a 4:3 letter boxed DVD. Second much of the DVD is grainy and out of focus. Only the very close up shots of the dancers faces are even partially acceptable on a large screen projection TV system. The medium and long shots reveal very little detail and are in many cases not well focused. Colors and sounds are OK, but don't buy this for the picture quality that is associated with the other SUPER BIT DVDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Reviewer from Canada","review":"I have a previous version of this DVD.

Colin Dunne is such an amazing dancer, and Jean Butler is so graceful, it's like her feet don't even touch the ground. Although Michael Flatley had a certain stage presence that no other male performer can compete with, Colin Dunne is technically better than Flatley and does not have an ego problem. The only thing that I did not like about this video was the editing job. There are constant camera switches and it's very distracting. Overall, though, this video is a must have for any Irish dance fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This video is the best.","review":"I loved this video. If you have seen Riverdance before, then you won't be disappointed and if you have never seen Riverdance, then after seeing this video you will want to watch again and again. I would give this video 5 stars but the editing can be confusing at times. The content definitely deserves 5 stars but the editing isn't. The original Riverdance video is better in that respect because it seemed like you were watching the show live. But R2 seems more like a movie or taped production. The dancing is first rate. I had never seen or really heard of Irish step dancing before Riverdance and now I love it. There are also other types of dance that should please everyone. I highly recommend this to anyone. You will not be disappointed. END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Technically this DVD is a Disaster","review":"Terrific performance. Choppy editing. I was looking forward to getting this wide screen Superbit DVD. What a disappointment! First of all, it's not wide screen--it's actually SHORT screen. On a wide screen TV it takes less space than a \\"full screen\\" 4:3 DVD or VHS tape. That is, large black bands on the sides and narrower black bands on the top and bottom. One can try the \\"zoom\\" function on the TV, but with two unfortunate consequences: You lose the top and bottom of the pucture and you make the already very poor definition picture even worse. Superbit indeed! In short, though described as \\"anamorphic\\" on the box, it surely is NOT. It's extremely fuzzy on my 50\\" monitor, much more so than almost any of the many dance DVDs that we own. As another reviewer suggested, they could have produced this travesty by simply copying a VHS tape. Superbit? Forget it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor video production of an outstanding performance","review":"I saw Riverdance at the Auditorium Theatre in Chicago in a production very similar to the one on this videotape performed and recorded live at Radio City Music Hall. What I saw on the video was a small fraction of the sensational dancing demonstrated by the performers I saw in person. That is because there are far more shots showing the head, torso and theatre than full-body dancing. Just as soon as you think you are really going see some fabulous dancing the camera cuts away. I think the tape editors were too into the art of video and not at all into the art of DANCE. It was very frustrating to watch this videotape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great show, dreadful video","review":"I saw the show with Colin Dunne, and was delighted with it. But the video was a dreadful disappointment. The direction is nothing less than atrocious. There is constant cutting from one angle to another, and to closeups of feet and faces.After a while I began timing the shots. The average length of time before each change of camera: Five seconds. To film such extraordinary dancers in this flashy, incredibly distracting way is a slap in the face to dancers and audience alike. This is an unwatchable disaster of a video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing for anyone who's seen the show","review":"I've seen the live show 3 times now, and this DVD is a disappointment. The video is fuzzy, the audio lacks the bass \\"feel\\" (the audio CD has MUCH better sound). If you've never seen the live show, have little chance of ever seeing it, and don't buy VHS, then you might like this DVD. Otherwise, save your money. I gave it two stars SOLELY because it's Riverdance."},{"rating":"1","title":"The show was good but the transfer to DVD was AWFUL.","review":"I was so looking forward to this DVD but was completely disappointed. I have the original Riverdance VHS tape and was looking forward to a similar joyous event but with all of the added benefits of DVD. The performance was on par with the original Riverdance Dublin performance (better or worse depending on your comparison of Michael Flately vs Colin Dunne) but the quality of the transfer was AWFUL! The VHS tape had better quality! To my eye, it looked like the NYC performance was shot on 16mm film and a simple transfer made to DVD. No surround, no bass effect and a grainy image. Stay with the tape if you want to see this show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritating","review":"I had seen the show on Broadway and decided to borrow this from my library before buying. Am SO glad I did. Too often, the film cuts away from the overall view of the stage and comes in close so that you can't see the feet and that's where the dancing is! Whoever filmed this didn't trust the material, which can and does stand on its own--just not on this dvd. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book in the world","review":"CHEERFUL is a relic from my childhood, a beautiful little book with ezquisite illustrations and some of the most achingly poignant prose I have ever experienced.

The engine room is much cleaner now. It is probably lighter without the ton of plastic you remove. The fun part is tromping on the gas. It is much louder than I expected. I really like the sound. It gets a bit loud for my wife, but she never tromps on the gas anyway.A minor minus is one of the plastic peices you remove has the big HEMI logo on it.

I assumed it was a battery but couldn't open the back myself and FINALLY got to a jeweler last week to get a new battery. The jeweler installed the battery and the watch worked for a couple of hours and stopped again. So, for $65 plus the cost of a replacement battery, we got about 2 weeks of function.

The seller did a rather good job of delivering the product swiftly, though it was a little bit bunged up in spots. Nothing serious, though, and not enough to detract from the games within. However, these games are available for free on the Internet, and while I thought, at first, that there were problems with the copy protection that needed original copies to circumvent, I have found this assumption to be completely wrong.

I didn't expect the game to be of a very high quality, but most of the games had copy protects (older games require passwords and such to actually play the game). I had expected this, however the included documentation was so lousy I never made it into most of the games.I found around four of the games playable, and somewhat entertaining.

I shopped around and considered before ordering, and after receiving and using, like them. The white color makes a nice clean looking envelope (compared to the brown color). I wasnt familiar with this type of seal, but it works well, it is plenty wide enough to make a strong & secure seal, altho it is possible to re-open it without ruining it. The sticky, on both sides, allows them to be stacked in the box they come in without sticking together, but when you seal the 2 sticky edges together it seals quite well. The only drawback for me is that the white paper allows print to possibly show thru, I would prefer a security interior. Another great thing about this envelope is that current postal regulations call this 6x9 envelope a 'letter', as long as it's less than 1/4\\" thick, and uses the same postage as any letter ($0.44/oz); but if you buy a 6.5 x 9.5 envelope, offered elsewhere, it is considered a 'large envelope' which costs $0.80 for the first ounce."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this program!","review":"This is an excellent way to learn a language.

This CD has three live performances on TV or radio. Because he tried to put his best foot forward three different times, some of the songs are repeats. Wes didn't play them the same way, so there's nothing wrong with hearing them again. Wes sounds great, and the backing band is pretty good. The bass and drums don't make much impression, but Harold Mabern is very good, and Martial Solal rips off a classic piano fill on \\"Twisted Blues\\".

This book wasn't an adventure- it was a dud, IMO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz","review":"I never do not finish a book. Well that all changed with this tedious quagmire of detail. Complete snooze. Do NOT bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oregon series for young readers?","review":"I read \\"Arctic Drift\\" by Cussler and thought it was great. I read a little bit about the author and thought I would start at the beginning and I was excited to hopefully read all his books. I started with \\"the Oregon Series, Golden Buddha.\\" I read and read, thinking this would start to make sense or maybe the unbelievable aspects would stop happening. Well they didn't, I read where others think Cussler had not even read this and I have to agree, it is impossible to follow and so unbelievable it is absurd. I bought the first two in the series for Kindle and I want my money back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Golden Boredom","review":"This is my first Clive Cussler and my last. It is juvenile and unbelievable. I read more convincing Superman comic books when I was 14. I actually laughed out loud when I read the conversation with Putin, it was that silly. I suppose this would be convincing if my IQ was only 64. I was so bored, that by the time I read half the book I was skipping entire pages and missed nothing. Save your money and buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cussler fans- don't waste your time and money","review":"Mr. Cussler, please don't lend your revered name to such poorly written stuff as \\"The Oregon File\\" series. Your name on the cover, and your pic on the back may sell books to your loyal fans, but will quickly destroy our faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brokenhearted","review":"Like others, I have been a faithful reader of anything Mr. Cussler puts his name on. Sadly, he has evidently decided to put his name on garbage. Perhaps the loss of his wife impacted his judgement, but nonetheless, this is an awful book. So awful that i quit halfway. That is the first book I have ever given up on in that genre.The one good thing is that I am encouraged to write something of my own. It could be no worse, though unpublishable, as this thing of his should have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible! Boring! Confusing!","review":"I used to love Cussler's books, but this one was so painful I will think twice before buying another. I forced myself through about 3/4 of it before I gave up. I couldn't read more than about 8 pages at a time - I kept getting lost (and bored) Too many characters (none of which really had any character), too much jumping around from one group to another, and a really badly presented story. I read about 50 books a year, and this was the worst I have read in several years. Too bad, Clive - maybe re-read your first 8 or 10 and start using them as a guideline for the next."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one bites the dust","review":"Here are the facts. I never write reviews and I am a huge Cussler fan. I have read everybook published by Cussler and yes over the last few years they have tailed off some. But this one just blows. I kept rubbing my belly and praying that it would end. A huge waste of time and paper. Dirt and Al would have been able to take care of this business before breakfast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad, so bad.","review":"It seems as if more and more people who have made a recognizable name for themselves by giving us a good product (Yes, books are a product) then decide to up their income by allowing some other product use that name, i.e., a movie star putting her name on a bottle of perfume. I see that here. Cussler's name is proudly bannered across the top of the book but it is certainly not Cussler inside. I wonder if he even read it. If he has and still allowed this to go to the publishers means that he has absolutely no respect for his readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"rubbish!","review":"8.99 for an older book that you cannot resell or loan to others is rubbish! Even worse that it wasn't even written by Cussler! Sorry. One star is being generous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Golden Budha","review":"I love this book. If you don't like it, try the books co-written by Jack DuBrul. I find that those are better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a bad Mission Impossible","review":"Clive Cussler is generally a fun read, even if the author has marginal writing skills. This is clearly NOT written by Clive Cussler, and it shows in being the thinnest plot - like a bad Mission Impossible episode. How do you write characters where \\"good guys\\" have sex with a \\"villain\\" to earn their high-dollar pay checks? The gizmos, \\"in the nick of time\\" rescues, and the rest are just ludicrous. With one \\"bad guy\\" who was a cardboard charicature of Larry Ellison, all that this needed was the Chinese \\"bad guys\\" being outfitted in MI-like Nazi surplus uniforms and a self-destructing audio tape.If you ever hear Tom Cruise signed up for the movie rights to this, you know his career is over. Clive's sure is..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic!","review":"Too many characters, poorly drawn, indestinguishable from each other, laughable plotting................Oh, forget it: I've already put in more effort than Cussler did on this book. I'm guessing his only contribution is his name."},{"rating":"1","title":"How dumb does Cussler think the reading public is?","review":"While Cussler's books are not always up to the same standard, I never thought I'd write a bad review of one of them. But this effort is so bad, it's insulting.Anyone who remembers the old Mission:Impossible TV series will recognize this type of plot, though this particular rendition is so overly-stretched and overly-detailed and overly-populated with cardboard characters that it reads like a schematic.I realize that Cussler must be bored by now and wants to extend his franchise by handing over the reins to other writers, but so far his efforts have failed. While the NUMA series is at least mildly interesting, this debut of the Oregon Files series reads like nonfiction (surprise, surprise), and dull nonfiction at that.The fact that this went straight to paperback should have been a clue, like movies that go direct to video/DVD without ever having been released in theatres.Save your money. This is a dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was disappointed like many of the previous readers, mostly having to do with non-existent character development (all clones of each other), insipid dialogue and no real suspense because the mission was done by superhumans (all of whom seemed to be \\"ruggedly handsome\\"). However, I was also irked by some of the technical inconsistencies. For example, if one can actually believe that non-musicians can air-guitar their way through a live performance, it doesn't explain how the drummer managed to fool everyone. Also, I find it hard to believe that their GPS was working in the depths of the sewers. Also, the cops' plan to pour dye into the sewers didn't seem like it should have worried the corporation; with a couple of hours head start, wouldn't their raft pop out into the harbour long before the dye? Also, the CIA head was 33 years old in 1959, and supposedly was some kind of intelligence officer in WWII; pretty responsible job for someone who was 19-years old at the end of the war."},{"rating":"1","title":"Golden Buddha-A Golden Bummer","review":"If you like the Dirk Pitt series & the Kurt Austin series, don't bother reading this book! The action is NOT there, nor is the intrigue that is such a part of the Pitt/Austin series. This book was not as 'action-packed' as the two other series, and left me wishing the book to be over. I had to 'make' myself finish the book, and even then, my only comment was \\"That's it?!\\" It's definitely NOT the 'page-turner' type story that is such a part of the Pitt/Austin series. And, to be honest, I miss the 'cameo' appearances of the author in the Pitt novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough Action For A Good Short Story","review":"Unfortunately, Mr Cussler needs a lot of money to keep his real world NUMA salvage operations going, so he obviously made a deal to allow his name to be put on this sickly effort at writing an adventure novel. That's the only excuse I can imagine for the existance of this drawn out mess. Save your money and buy something REALLY written by Mr Cussler."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only thing Cussler about this book is the cover.","review":"WOW, what a dissapointment. It was a struggle to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a really bad Bruckenheimer film","review":"Imagine a bunch of rich, perfect, shallow guys and gals dressing up as a cover-rock band so they can steal a piece of art...they have high-tech gadgets, they spew one-liners, they are completely unlikely. This is a Disney-meets-Bruckenheimer film in type. Maybe the worst book I've ever read. No sense of reality, no sense of place, no real characters, and NO intrigue."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"Even though I bought the paperback book at HalfPrice Books for significantly less than its $15 cover price, I still feel like I wasted my money. I have enjoyed all of Cussler's fiction (except the books he wrote \\"with\\" Paul Kemprecos) but this one is definitely NOT a Cussler book. Tedious, lengthy descriptions, a total lack of character development and weak dialog make this book painful to read. In fact, I put the book down eighty pages from the end -- I just couldn't stand it any more.I guess I'll forgo any more Cussler books until he returns to writing them without \\"help\\" from other authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"First Clancy, Now Cussler","review":"I NEVER thought Clive Cussler would have an awful book. But I doubt he wrote this one anyway. His art of switching scenes while keeping interest is not here. This is a hodgepodge of......something. Complicated story. Outright low morals (gee, professional hookers???) were a surprise. I'll pass on future co-authored books."},{"rating":"1","title":"GOLDEN BUDDHA","review":"I normally enjoy the Cussler books, especially the Dirk Pitt stories. This one, however, is especially contrived and very confusing. There is virtually no character development, so keeping track of the various pieces of the plot is difficult. I felt like I was in the \\"fog of war\\", seeing hundreds of snippets and just hoping it all came together in the end. Will the real Clive Cussler please come back?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing and overly complex","review":"This was my first exposure to the Oregon Files, but based on previous Cussler books, I was looking forward to another interesting adventure. At first glance, the book is packed with excitement, good character development and fast paced story. Unfortunately, I found all the different story lines difficult to follow. Maybe I am not used to so many things going on in one chapter, or maybe the writing is truncated and choppy. Despite this, I was able to enjoy the book and look forward to my next Oregon Files adventure."},{"rating":"1","title":"A hardcover by anyother name","review":"I recently tried to order an advertised Amazon hardcover book. Either Amazon.com does not know what a hardcover book is or they do not know what they are selling. After three failed attempts at getting the hard cover book I wanted, I have given up. I must say Amazon is very good about returning purchases, I just wish they were better at getting the right stuff delivered."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good idea that should be continued.","review":"I thought I was reading a Dan Brown book.

However, I prefer his books written without a coauthor. Maybe he's using a new editor..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great new series by Cussler!","review":"Juan Cabrillo is a great new character for Mr. Cussler. The 'Chairman' and his crew are all highly intelligent people and are as daring as Dirk Pitt and Kurt Austin. As a Cussler fan, I have read and listened to all of his books that I own numerous times and always find something new to enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disapointed","review":"I listened to this book on CD. I cannot comment on how it comes across in print. On the CD, it is a cross between Mission Impossible and Charlies Angels (albeit male angels). The reader must have used the same voice coach that was used in Kung Pow, the Fist of Death.Everything works perfectly, there is no tension and the dialog is insipid.I truely hope that this collaberation was just to get Mr. Cussler's name on the cover. It departs so much from his normal style of writing that I cannot see his hand in the story except in very few places.One other disadvantage to the CD version, you don't get the list of characters at the beginning as you do in the paperback edition.Thank goodness I got this at the public library and didn't plunk down hard earned cash for it. (Well, I guess my taxes paid for it.)I'll give the next book a try and hope that it is much better than this one. If not, I'm going looking for another Dirk Pitt."},{"rating":"1","title":"very boring","review":"I am a long time Cussler fan and a Craig Dirgo fan as well. But this book is so boring I would rather watch paint dry."},{"rating":"1","title":"More mission impossible than Clive Cussler","review":"This book was a huge disappointment to me. I love Cussler's books, but I'm pretty sure he didn't do much of the writing for this one. Not very much \\"action\\", nor suspense as, we know the \\"good\\" guys will win out in this mostly imitation of a \\"Mission Impossible\\" TV story, though a good imitation. So many characters, the author - mostly Dirgo, I'm sure (whoever he is), that a list of characters had to be added. Also, the story pretty much jumped around a lot, with very short chapters. I think Clive Cussler's name was added so the book would sell. I won't buy any further books by this author (Dirgo)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I am a big Cussler fan, at least I thought I was. Golden Buddha, without mincing words, is terrible. I agree with most of the reviewers that this book lacks any punch at all. As a reader, I didn't care about any of the characters, and I kept waiting for there to be a climax. Most Cussler novels are fairly unbelievable, but this one was just too much. I could suspend my disbelief for that long. There wasn't a single moment in the story where I was concerned about the characters at all. The crew of the Oregon seem to have the ability to do anything they want at anytime. Very bad book, and this is coming from a Cussler and Clancy fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a Clive Cussler Book!","review":"I cannot believe Clive Cussler wrote a word in this book. It is even harder to believe he endorsed it with his name. I have been a Clive Cussler fan since I first read his works many years ago. This is does not come close to what I have come to expect from a Clive Cussler book. I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"After reading \\"Amazonia\\" by Rollins, and \\"Ice Station\\" by Matthew Reilly, this book was very boring, not of the Pitt or Austin action adventures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly muddled","review":"This is one of the most horribly muddled \\"thrillers\\" I've ever read. By the end, I wasn't sure who was \\"winning\\" or \\"losing,\\" nor did I really care. Clive better quit sub-contracting out his writing. He should dump this cast of characters and concentrate on Dirk Pitt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Golden Buda a disappointment","review":"Clive Cussler is one of my favorite authors. I read anything he writes and anything he endorses. Golden Buda is my first Cussler disappointment. As is typical of Cussler's style, the story is fast paced and richly detailed. The story however is far too predictable and lacks the excitement and raw emotion I have become accustomed to. Portions of the book obviously had Cussler's polished touch, but other sections were substandard. Had I bothered to thumb through the pages before I bought it, the book would have remained in the store. The phrase \\"he said\\" fails to set the tone of a conversation. Its frequent use in Golden Buda is possibly the second biggest reason for my dissappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why a new series?","review":"I almost never post reviews, but Clive Cussler is my favorite author and I am so disappointed in Golden Buddha, it's not funny. A friendwho used to write book reviews and still gets review copies gave this to me because he knows I love Cussler. Golden Buddha shouldhave been written as a TV Movie of the Week and Cussler's name taken off of it. I can't believe the so-called 'professional' reviewerssaying this is as good as the Dirk Pitt and Kurt Austin series. Puh-leeze! I am hoping Cussler's newest Dirk Pitt novel, Trojan Odyssey istons better than this, or he's lost a loyal fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cussler in Top Form","review":"The Golden Buddha is Clive Cussler's first offering in his \\"Oregon Files\\" series and he's pulled out all the stops. We're introduced to a new cast of characters led by Juan Cabrillo and his band of merry men that roam the world doing good deeds for a fee. Think soldiers of fortune with a dash of conscience mixed in for good measure.In a departure from the Dirk Pitt and Kurt Austin novels, Cussler keeps the action moving and avoids the drawn-out survival-against-the-elements routines so typical in those other series. In Golden Buddha, Cussler still delivers terrific character development, meaningful dialogue, and of course, tons of intrigue and suspense.It's some of the best fun you can have reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who needs morality","review":"Amazing how a writer can attempt to make an immoral organization, the corporation, look moral. Only someone like Al Capone could sympathize with this group on the Oregon. How can anyone justify having the sort of firepower as is on the Oregon. The US apparently is willing to finance the group, but the US also financed Sadam, Noriega, ... Unfortunately, in this sense it is too much like real American policy, which absolutely disgusts me (the ends justify the ends no matter how many bodies are left behind, as long as they are not righteous Americans). The characters are cliché, there is no suspense since everything goes as planned, and anyone in the crew can just about do anything, including being a successful rock band. It makes me look back on the Dirk Pitt books and wonder about Dirk's morality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Oregon Files","review":"I have read a lot of negative reviews of this series. I personally think the entire series, including Golden Buddha, great. Yes, they are different than the Dirk Pitt series, what is so bad about that? A different style is good and refreshing. I love ALL the characters in the books. They operate as a family...isn't that good?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible and soulless","review":"I can only think of three or four books which I have begun reading voluntarily and decided to never finish reading (compared to thousands which I happily finished). This is one of them. I was surprised, however, by how many of the reviews on this site agree with my reasons for doing so. There is little that I can say that they have not already. The characters are the flattest I've ever seen in fiction. The story has no soul. Since I haven't finished the story, and since other reviews have gone so much deeper into it than I can or care to, I'll simply end by saying that this is my first experience with Clive Cussler's novels, and it will be my last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best West Books","review":"I am greatly disappointed in this order. I wanted a softcover book (size 9 1/4 x 6) and ordered what I assumed was one listed at $14.98(the same price I saw on a friend's copy). I was sent a small paperback(size 6 1/2x4 1/4) rather than what I ordered. This copy had a label on the back over the original price of $7.98. A sticker on the front was for $4.49. I ordered a softcover book and was sent a paperback book at the softcover price.I know that it is \\"Let the buyer beware\\" but I feel that I was defiiately taken advantage of. To sell a $4.49 book for $14.98 is reallylow.I sent an email to them through Amazon, but got no response, which leads me to the assumption that it was not a mistake on the part of Best West Books.Obviously, I will never buy from them again and urge any potential customers to go elsewhre.The rating should be minus stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cussler flubs finally.","review":"I've read most of Cussler's works and most of them keep me on the edge of my seat. Not this one. It's got way too many characters to keep up with besides the standard Oregon crew. From some stage after the halfway point, I found myself almost dozing, as it was all predictable. Cussler tried to sew up a story that had a zillion subplots and characters. It was very jerky, to say the least. I was tempted to skip pages, which in itself, tells you something. Cussler didn't develop Cabrillo like he has done in other works. Maybe the problem lies with his partner. It definitely isn't like reading one he did with Jack Du Brul. If this was the first Cussler I read, I'd move on to another author."},{"rating":"1","title":"This stuff sells?","review":"I was writing stuff like this when I was 14. All his characters are basically the same and make the same dry jokes throughout the book. The real people he uses are not convincing (I can't imagine Valdimir Putin laughing during a negotiation.) The plot manages to avoid being exciting for most of the book because the team always seem to have things under control, and almost nothing goes wrong. Having said that, there are countless plot holes and things that just don't add up. Poorly written and thoroughly disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Audio Book","review":"No previous reviewer has commented on the unabridged audio version of this book. With this audio, you not only get a lousy story, but as a bonus you get to hear the story read by a lousy and insulting \\"actor.\\" I can't believe the publisher ever listened to this before it was released. Words spoken by Chinese characters are \\"performed\\" in the most cartoonish \\"Ah So!\\" accent you can imagine. It's almost worth looking for a copy in the $3.00 discount stack just to hear how truly awful this book is. I'm trying to plow through to the end of the story, but I fear falling asleep at the wheel. I am not Asian, but I am nonetheless deeply offended by this audiobook performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed, difficult, not worth it","review":"I have read all of cussler's books. I struggled to stay interested with the storyline and characters. The characters were too numerous and you never got any feeling for who they are. There are too many other good cussler novels to purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"The Golden Buddha by Clive CusslerOver the years I have been reading most of Clive Cussler's adventure stories. They were always very entertaining and some of the descriptions quite beautiful. The stories are at all times fast moving with good development of their often implausible tales. They had a kind of inner truth which an adventure story achieves by good storytelling. Always good fun!If you are a reader of Clive Cussler's books I need to warn you that \\"The Golden Buddha\\" fails on all counts. There is lots of confusing plot, poorly developed, dialogue is so banal that it is an insult to the reader.Mysterious? The greatest mystery is the question who actually wrote it? Is the name Clive Cussler used only as a brand-name to make a quick buck?Where is Clive Cussler? Does he still write?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't go there anymore mr. Cussler","review":"I am also a huge fan of mr. Cussler, so I bought this book with great expectations. But like most others I was greatly disappointed. The plot is bad, the story is boring, the characters are more like international terrorist stealing and killing, and for what ? Personal wealth!.Is Craig Dirgo synonymous with Bin Laden ?I had to give 1 stars, it is not possible to give less. Please mr. Cussler don't continue this serie."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't know who wrote this, but it was Clive Cussler","review":"I am a huge Cussler fan, but I am terribly disappointed in this book. I am sorry I wasted a gift certificate on it. I don't know who wrote this, but it certainly wasn't Dr. Cussler or Mr. Dirgo. I put it down after 70 pages. I could care less about Juan Cabrilllo and his corporation. It's sad to see someone using Dr. Cussler's name to sell this inferior work. I could see Clive coming up with the characters, but that's about it. I had high hopes for this book; I enjoyed the coauthor's previous works, Seahunters and Seahunters II. I'll go back to the Dirk Pitt series to make sure I get the bad taste out of my head!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopefully This Series Will Improve!","review":"Unlike Cussler's other series, I found this first story of the \\"Oregon Files\\" slow going at first and rather confusing. There are just too many things going on (no problem, I suppose, for multi-taskers!) and way too many characters to keep track of. Also, there's little to no character development even of \\"Mr. Chairman\\", Juan Cabrillo. The fact that he and his companions are mercenaries (with a penchant for good deeds that pay well) doesn't compare favorably with the NUMA heroes. However, the plots were intriguing and getting the golden budda out of the country was exciting and more like the roller coaster rides I expect from Mr. Cussler and co-writers. I look forward to the subsequent Oregon Files with high hopes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trying on a new pair of shoes...","review":"We have all become so comfortable with Dirk, Al and now Kurt that maybe we were expecting the comfortable ol' sneaker that seems to always fit just right. This is a new series with a different feel to what Cussler has done in the past. I agree that it kept you moving from scene to scene, but I didn't find myself fighting through a particular long winded and tiresome section in order to get to the good stuff. At times the pace was hectic, but overall, I truly enjoyed this book. This review comes from someone who has read nearly all of Cussler's previous novels, half of Ludlum's and good number of other works. I am looking forward to the next installment of the Oregon Files"},{"rating":"2","title":"Craig Dirgo way to go","review":"I see so many very negative reviews it makes me sad. This is an interesting fast read. Again please understand just because Mr. Cusslers name is on it doesn't mean he wrote the whole book. Mr. Dirgo way to go. The writing is tight and the story interesting. I loved all of the many different characters instead of just a few. It was great reading about Cabrillo and his crew.I was always wondering if they would be seen again after reading about them Pitt & Giordino in Flood Tide. These charachters are all well written. Professional ex-CIA types all working well together to pull off their latest heist, pulling off their mission sucessfully and I am looking forward to the next book in this series. Mr. Cussler's seems to be enjoying himself. As for those of you who only want Dirk Pitt, get over it, or only read the Dirk Pitt novels and quit bashing all of the new writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected more than the same games","review":"Last reviews have raved about this. Yes, very nice illustrations and clear instructions but in terms of content, sorry, out of the forty five or so games, I already knew about 20. I expected a little more than the games we all know about e.g. leapfrog, twenty questions ! and if they are to be cited, then more variations should be given. For example, skipping has only a couple of examples. Not all games are going to be suitable for your kids either. For example, a lot of games require 4 or more kids, only a few are for the car and these are for older children. Overall, this big book is little on games - certainly not a extensive 'resource' for teachers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of hard work & love went into creating this book!","review":"Hello Everyone!

I have read this book from cover to cover several times, and it gives the reader an astonishing amount of information about the universe. I have the 1977 edition, and the only regret I have is that Cambridge has not published an updated edition. With the changes that have taken place in astonomy, it still gives the reader an incredible background in cosmology. However, many parts of the book are rather technical.

There was no text attached to the file other than that. Hard to read a book that isn't there, but hey, at least the price was right. I'm assuming this was an oversight by Amazon--and hopefully one they can fix--not a hiccup in the downloading process, but who knows?

It is like a journal entry of scientific observations mixed with a few stories. If you love biology and the history of scientific thought this would be a great listen. My biggest knock on this book is that the voice is a British guy who seems to just drag on, I wasn't able to ever turn this book on with my wife around she thought his voice was absolutely monotone for a Brit. (she lived in England for a couple years). I admit to falling asleep multiple times with this book on, hence why I don't recommend this one while driving in the car.

There are lots of arbitrary cuts - often pages long - and the editing is badly done so the result often doesn't make much sense. Pretty much every chapter is mangled in this way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder","review":"While our present day science curricullum owes much of it's insight to the inspirational theories of Charles Darwin, science as it is taught by schoolhouse instructors lacks the intestinal fortitude shown by the young Darwin. If everyone involved in the study of science were to approach not only life but science in the same manner as Charles Darwin who knows where we would be today. Confusion over whether or not there is a supreme diety has brought us to a virtual standstill in areas that desperately need our further attention. After reading The Voyage of the Beagle, I came to realize how Darwin was not intent on setting the religious world on its head. Instead he was living the dreams of any headstrong young man bent on seeing the world in its purest form. I would recommend this book to any scientist or researcher for that matter who feels he/she has yet to feel the fire light their inspirational drive."},{"rating":"1","title":"A technical disappointment","review":"The CD version of this book is very easy to use and the search function is wonderful. HOWEVER there is no way to copy text off the screen so you can paste it into other applications. I find this very frustrating and a big disappointment.The CD version of \\"The Origin of Species\\" suffers from the same problem. Beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falsity in Advertising","review":"This so-called \\"Illustrated Edition\\" contains very few illustrations: a mere handful of small black-and-white graphics. Evidently the book is just a reprint of an earlier edition. It has no introduction and no notes. Darwin, yes; this edition, not so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darwin's Journal","review":"This audio book had an excelent reader, using pretty close to the dialect of the time. Which was good because I was using it for a character reference, playing Darwin in a theater piece. The book it self was a little long and winded. It was truely a journal of his voyage. Don't look for many of his scientific conclusions. For this you would want to get \\"Origin of the Spieces.\\" It was filled with stories of his adventures and what he came accross on his trip. Good listening material for long driving trips. It was a bit dry for just sitting and listening to, but there were some entertaining parts burried in there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better","review":"I used to be a die-hard Christina Skye fan--I adored \\"Going Overboard\\" and have read it more times than I can count--but her new Code Name books left me feeling like something was just missing...but this last book was a HUGE improvement. It gives me hope that the old Christina that I used to love is back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mix of sci-fi, fantasy and a bit","review":"of romance. I found myself skimming the book frequently, looking for the good parts. I don't like sci-fi, so the 'enhanced' male character, I actually found freaky and scary, not sexy! I had a hard time suspending disbelief at the many off the wall happenings and I feel that the scenes towards the end of the book weren't written to be understood, at all, really. Prior books were good, fun and a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Code Name: Mediocre","review":"(2 & 1/2 starts to be exact) This book is the beginning of a series within a series. Skye's \\"Code Name\\" books all involve romances with Navy Seals. Starting with this book, the Seals are part of a surreal group with psychic-ish abilities stemming from microchip enhancements. In this book one of these special Seals is protecting a woman who trains very special dogs that will be used on missions. The woman also happens to be the sister of the Seal's friend and fellow member of his team. Sparks begin to fly between the trainer and the Seal. Like in Skye's other Code Name books, the chemistry between the two leads is set up well, but romance part of the story ends rather lamely. The dogs, however, make quite charming characters themselves and make this book more enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paranormal Thriller","review":"Code Name: Baby was a new type of paranormal that I enjoyed. Christina introduced mind-altering used by a special group of Navy SEALS who can make you believe you see and feel things that aren't really there. Added to that are special dogs who can work as a team and do amazing feats. Izzy was again a part of the book, after all it wouldn't be a SEALS book without him. Code Name: Baby had it's funny parts with Miki, Kit's friend. For those lovers of the Code Name series, I do recommend this book and look forward to many more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of mistakes","review":"The content of this book is hard to review, per se, since the translation and notation are full of mistakes.

Its filled with crazy british humor. The main character is unique and quirky and you cant help but fall in love with.The book starts off with Georgia in a life that she thought she wanted only to relize its far from it.

US Games Inc is resorting to having their Pocket Thoths printed in China instead of Switzerland. The result? The deck looks like a distored bootleg photocopy of the original version: the cards have a yellowish tinge, and are printed on inferior cardstock. The box looks like a small dark blue version of the US Games box for the standard and large size Thoth decks. (with the 2 of disks in the front)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Printed in Belgium, not Switzerland!!!","review":"The box cover picture shown above is misleading, if not deceptive. I bought this deck from a Marketplace seller because I thought it is the one printed in Switzerland (which has the above box cover) with the much higher quality pictures. But instead, I received the cheap version of this tarot deck printed in Belgium, which has a completely different box cover picture. I wish these sellers were more honest and straight forward about the products they are selling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not strong enough","review":"I have a Maine Coon type cat, extremely good natured. He's been given a lion cut by groomers 3 times. I bought these clippers hoping they would perform well enought for the job to be done in 20 minutes, which is about how long it took the last groomer, for whom I held the cat. But these clippers were not as fast or strong. Took an hour to do 2/3s of the cat: and he was severely tried as the clippers would pull the hair. With much oiling and much soothing we got only part of the job done. If you don't want to torture an animal with this type of coat, you'll have to get the premium clippers I suppose. For animals with lighter coats, these clippers might do fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product, Great Price","review":"Saw these clippers for $135.00 at a store! Low heat, good cutting through tough hair- the metal combs that come with it are the only down-fall: they fall off if you press down hard. Best to buy guides with 2-clip attatchment."},{"rating":"2","title":"She could not do better","review":"This is a book worth reading if you are into the genre. Loved it. Recommended to me by Robin Hobb. I could kiss her for suggesting it. I haven't read any other book by Mary Stewart. I'll have to check some out."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all time favorites","review":"The enchantment in this book is supported by an intelligent, graceful, deeply satisfying story. Mary Stewart's knowledge of the myths is the basis for the novel, but she weaves her own interpretation with such wisdom, humor and understanding, she develops her characters with a deceptive ease, that she creates a journey that I had to repeat several times. I may have read the trilogy (\\"The Crystal Cave\\" is followed by \\"The Hollow Hills\\" and the \\"Last Enchantment\\") 7 or 8 times. In one six week period when on vacation I read them three times in a row. I highly recommend it. You may never want to hear another interpretation of Merlin. No one can match Stewart's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"I'd wanted to read this book for a while, and finally picked up a copy while on vacation. I'm so glad i did. Stewart's portrayal of Merlin as a man with powers and problems, long on righteousness and short on sex drive, makes him a marvelous shadow hero. he's not the king on the mount, but he's the mystic on the hill, guiding, seeing and knowing while the blood flows below."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible.","review":"I found this book to be quite interesting in that it told us what was really \\"behind\\" the famed and feared Merlin. It has a very vivid description of the different settings which help you to really feel what it was like in the time period which this book was written. Stewart does a great job of drawing you into the story by setting a mysterious tone to the character of merlin. I think that she did a great job widening the Arthurian legend and recommend this book for anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent saga!","review":"I recommend all the books in this saga, they are all very, very good. Couldn't put them down, read right through till the last page! Easy to read and follow, keeps you guessing, it's a great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"The Crystal Cave is about Merlin when he's young. It goes from the time he's around 8 up until he's in his twenties. Because of this, the whole book is lots of fun to read. Even if you don't like the Arthurian novels because they're all the same basic story you might like this. Arthur plays only a minor role at the end. I say minor role because he isn't born yet; the only influence he has is that Merlin begins to prepare for his arrival. So it's not like The Once And Future King, The Sword In The Stone, or any of the others. So, if you're bored with the usual Arthur stories, try this. You'll probably like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Believable Merlin","review":"This is my all-time favorite book. It is Mary Stewart at her best. I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new look at Merlin","review":"This was a fun book to read. It was neat to see Merlin as a child and young man, rather than the wise old wizard you're so used to seeing him as. A very original story and a very talented author, make this one a great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"an overlooked classic that will enrich your life!","review":"I first read this book in 8th grade, and of course was intrigued by the main character being Merlin. I did not know at the time that this book would become one of my all time favorites, due to its incredible plot, rich character development, and suberb writing.It will get any adult/teen into reading and the Arthurian saga."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"This was my first venture into Arthurian legend. I came away completely hooked. Mary Stewart brings young Merlin to life in the same manner as Stephen King proffers horror. Anyone halfway interested in Merlin, Arthur, and/or old England must place this book amongst their favorites!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle edition is really badly formatted","review":"This review is only about the Kindle edition. This is one of my favorite books and I have been waiting to have it available on Kindle. The book is so poorly formatted, completely left justified with page numbers embedded in the middle of pages. It gives the impression of having been scanned in and badly convertedI can't wait for a well formatted digital copy of this enchanting book and then the whole series"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is missing the prelude.","review":"This book is missing the prelude, which is a very important part of the story. Also the cover looks blurry, suggesting to me that it is not an authorized copy. I would not recommend this particular publisher but the story itself is wonderful. I'm just going to have to get a copy elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"clearly not as good as claimed","review":"the reason why this book got such a good review is as follows. the people who hate this book such as myself, do not often write reviews about books they do not like. try reading the \\"Pendragon Cycle\\" by Stephen R. Lawhead. it is a much more enjoyable book on arthurian legend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plain, Boring, Dull, confusing, and just plain bad!","review":"This has to be one of the wosrt books I have ever read. With 50+ characters, whose names either rhyme, or are extremely similar (Dinias, Dinas) this book gets so confusing. With Merlin's visions suddenly appearing, you don't know if Merlin is dreaming it, or if it's really happening. Mary Stewart's biggest failure. This book is plain and boring! No excitement, no pizaz!!!!!Leave it on the shelf!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yick.","review":"I read this book for summer reading. If I didn't HAVE to finish this book, I probably wouldn't have. It was somewhat interesting in parts, but not throughout the whole book. The beginning of the different books in The Crystal Cave were very boring, but then they would become more interesting as the chapters continued. The book is about Merlin, who is royal, but treated as a no-man's-child. His mother claims that his father is The Prince of Darkness. I really can't say more than that because there isn't much more to it. I didn't see a plot that lasted throughout this whole book. I was disappointed with it, but I will say it is readable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused","review":"I don't really know if it would be that boring but it is now because are teacher is forcing us to read it. The fastest way to turn people away from a book is to make them read it. Another thing, I really don't understand whats going on in the book. To me it's as if the characters are not throughly introduced just kind of thrown in there. I just don't understand some of it maybe its my age or something or that I'm not really interested in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting, emotional, detailed, page turner","review":"Crystal Cave had a sort of wonder and magic to it. I like how Mary Stewart protrayed Merlin as a clever sophisticated human being. I like the details and it has a lot of emotional parts. there were times when i might've cried. It was exciting though. There were a few places where I didn't know who the people were or what was being described. I had a hard time understanding some parts. I did find that as I read on it was easier to understand. I only recommend this book to people who like to read accelerated or high level reading or anyone who feels they can handle this book. It really isn't easy reading but if you are into that type of genre or into reading i recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful view of Merlin","review":"Stewart presents the character of Merlin in a human manner. However, he loses none of the mysticism that makes him such a wonderful character in the Arthurian legend. This book is easy and enjoyable to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all-time favorite books.","review":"I first read this book when I was about 13. The sequals had not yet been published. About ten years later I ran across the book again as well as its sequals. Now I've read them all at least four or five times. I love to re-read my favorite passages and meet these friends over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Good with lots of realistic people","review":"In The Crystal Cave I felt like I was there alongside Merlin. It was a pretty easy read. Lots of tense moments and parts that make you understand the relationships of the charactors. Very good! I had to hold myself back from reading the sequal in the store!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very colourful, neato kind of book","review":"I enjoyed looking at this book - I got it from the library. It's got many posters and lobby cards from Hitchcock's works, all in colour. And it's not just the same ones you see everywhere. This has posters from other countries too. Some of them are really WEIRD. Especially the Polish ones. But interesting. I think you should give this book a try if you like Hitchcock."},{"rating":"2","title":"groundbreaking","review":"This book was the first of its kind and caused uproar within the British police ranks when it was first published in 1993. Based on the author's PhD research with anonymous officers, the book contains both a semi-academic introduction to each issue but consists mostly of edited interviews with gay and lesbian police officers that are easy and interesting reading. The combination of Burke's socio-psychological observations along with the spoken word, make this book compelling and it remains a must read for all police officers and anyone else who still mis-understands what it really means to be gay."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Story a wonderful and insightful true story","review":"Caroline has done nothing less than a superb job in telling of her story and the may hardships and adventures. Her ability to convey these events as they took place is a very heart warming tale of her journey through a very difficult situation that some of us must make in our lives.Her hardships are tempered with those of happy days where she had found many friends. Her vivid descriptions of the heataches is telling of the tribulations she has endured.Her loves and tragic losses are given in such a way that the reader feels her pain as well as her joys. She now lives in the U.S.A. somewhere near Atlanta. But her life has and continues to bring many of us warmth and hope through her books.This is one book that I have enjoyed reading and will always cherish my entire life.

The animation is even more realistic and lively. It's the story though, that truly astounded me. It is sentimental and funny.I think everyone has had a favorite toy and as we come of age, we lose interest in it. While I certainly don't believe toys have feelings, the story can be transcended into reality. The toys can be symbolic of a best friend from childhood, and with the way the world is today, it is easy to grow apart as we grow up. Someday we may go back to find that friend and become tied to them again, and sometimes we just have to let them go and know that they will be best friends with someone else. I believe that this is the true heart of this movie.While this is certainly a great movie for kids, adults like me, will certainly find the humor and entertainment value in it as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"This movie is awesome.

I have seen it less expensive in other stores however."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best movie of the Decade","review":"After watching this movie, I thought to myself, \\"This is the modern day Casablanca!\\" I thought this because the story was very tight with no space. Every element in the movie advances the story the whole way through, I was so amazed. I have not seen a movie so well done in such a long time, and this movie is animated! It's also very comic, full of parodies and classic cinematic shots and even a bit of drama. During one part of the movie, this song comes on. I leaned over to my friend in disagreement and said, \\"Did Disney put this in?\\" By the last shot, my friend and I were holding back tears, \\"Holy cow, dude! Man, that's horrible.\\" But besides great cinema and effective storytelling, the animation was just as good as the first \\"Toy Story\\" which, to say the least, is exceptional! I really loved this movie for it's almost classic hollywood style mixed with modern ideas and techniques.

However, I would caution against purchasing this item. It contains the film, lots of bonus features such as deleted scenes, extra animated shorts, and of course the various interviews with cast and crew. However, this two-disc combo in DVD packaging is missing what is probably the 2nd most important feature after the film itself, and that is the Pixar short Luxo Jr! Yes, that is correct, Luxo Jr. is not present on either the Blu-ray disc or the DVD disc. Other than this huge omission, this is a great product.

The tables are turned: Buzz has to save Woody, and once again from a contemptable human. Can he do it? Will all the toys chip in and help? What do you think?The new main toy characters, Jessie the Yodeling Cowgirl, and the Old Prospector, are wonderfully voiced by Joan Cusak and TV's Frasier-- Kelsey Gramar.

The main flaw in this film was its attempt to be some kinda social commentary on toy collecting. Obviously, this film is a bit hypocritical, as the toys that came out to support this film were doing the very thing it was \\"criticizing.\\" So that mars the film's quality, and frankly, I could have done without it.

At the toynapper's hideout, Woody met Jessie the cowgirl, Bullseye the horse and Stinky Pete the prospector, all of which the toy collector planned to sell as a set to a museum in Tokyo.At home, the other toys came out with a rescue plan for Woody.

I own both Toy Story 1 and 2. I've seen 3 but found that it wasn't as great as the first two.My favorite is the first one. But my 2 year old niece, Evan, likes the 2nd one for one reason. JESSIE!!!! Sure there's Woody, Buzz Lightyear, Bullseye and more, including some barbies. But according to Evan, they don't compare to Jessie. And I don't blame her. Joan Cusack does a good job. Jessie is a lovable Cowgirl.I don't have a favorite myself because I like all the characters. I also enjoy the adult humor. Like when Zurg tells Buzz that he is his father, which gives it a satire to Star Wars. Another where Mr. Potato Head tells Hamm to let him drive (something like \\"let someone with two hands drive.\\" And then crashes the toy car into everything). And there's comedy that my niece can understand as humorous.So for the past few months that I've let my niece pick out a movie, Toy Story Jessie is the #1."},{"rating":"2","title":"Julie's review","review":"This is an awesome movie.

This is probably the smartest buy I've made in awhile. Not only do they give you the pre-order price guarantee (which I saved $4 for that), and not only do they give you $10 back for buying them together, BUT they also have in there redemption codes that get you a free ticket to see Toy Story 3 in each movie (so that's two free tickets to see Toy Story 3).When I first bought them, they were $24.99 each...so let's say with both of them, that's $50.00.Minus the $4 pre-order price guarentee=$46.00Minus the $10 promotion=$36.00Minus the $17 ($8.50 for each ticket) for the TS3 movie tickets= $19.00That means I spent $9.50 on each movie.

The only problem it just did not come up to the same standard as the first.Sometimes you just shouldn't go too far. I watched the first one many times this one I only watched twice.

Let me preview by saying I am a 20 year old college student, so I think I can safely say this movie is for everyone!I am not much for cartoons or animations (i wasnt much into the first Toy Story or A Bugs Life), but this movie was incredibly funny. It is very \\"punny\\" and was well worth the $5.50 to go see it! Some of the implied meanings (a few scenes poke fun at Jurrasic Park, etc.) were an interesting twist to see in a G movie. I plan to make it the next purchase of my DVD collection.Let me finish by saying if you havent seen the movies because its a \\"kids movie\\", you are really missing out.

I was wary of sequels, such as the Land Before Time and Disney's other attempts at continuing a sucessful story. And as I watched, I realized that this wasn't a sequel, just the next chapter in the life of the beloved Woody and Buzz. The story was well set up, and actually topped the first. It was interesting and funny. It had the same quick wit as the original, but the writers were clearly more comfortable with the characters. It took all of the great things from Toy Story, and used them to build even better things for Toy Story 2. I highly suggest it for every reason: It was funny, quick, intelligent, sweet, kind, enticing and interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even Better Than The First 'Toy Story'","review":"Here's yet one more sequel that more than lived up to its original great start. The first Toy Story was outstanding. This is just as good, if not better.Very fast-paced and very entertaining, this doesn't have a lot of laugh-out-loud parts but is definitely fun to watch with many good lines. What I appreciated was the lack of a nasty villain and any evil overtones, as was the case with the rotten neighborhood kid in the first film.I also appreciated the fantastic surround sound on the DVD (any of the Toy Story DVDs are great, by the way), along with the magnificent colors. Not to be forgotten is a wonderful, tear-jerking song in here, sung by Sarah MacLaclan. It gets to me every time.When you factor in all the nice characters, music, colors and sounds, this has to be one of the most beloved animated films of the modern era."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value","review":"The DVD/Blu-Ray combo pack was a great deal for the price, as it allows us to both let our daughter view her favorite movie downstairs on the home theater setup, as well as upstairs on her basic DVD player.

He loves woody more than Buzz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet, Fun Story","review":"Ok, not as good as 1 or 3 but pretty good and another facet to explore in a toy's story. Woody's arm rips off a bit and it becomes apparent that he's getting old. Kidnapped from a rummage sale where he is accidentally placed, Woody ends up with a toy seller and discovers his forgotten history, He is a character from a 1950's TV puppet show. His old compatriots are introduced and they learn that they will be sold to a toy museum in Japan. What is better? Being preserved in a museum in Japan or being Andy's toy? What will Woody and his new friends choose?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but not as great as original.","review":"Overall, this is one of the better sequels out there. The animation is wonderful and I love the soundtrack. This really keeps my 2 year olds attention and he loves Woody and Buzz. I think the first Toy Story was a little bit more unique/original/quippy, but this is great, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"This CD was definitely relaxing, but if what you're after is a CD to get you through pregnancy and a natural childbirth, definitely invest in another \\"system\\" - Hypnobabies, Hypnobirthing etc. This isn't worth the price as it ended up in the back of the CD collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just don't buy this.","review":"You'd think if you were going to design a cable you'd coat with something somewhat flexible.

Did they just choose Eli Wallach to be Antonio's dad because they liked him in another film?? NOTHING in this film works, and the actors try to hide that with silly over acting which falls flat at every turn. I expected to see some chemistry between Antonio and Melanie, since this is the movie where they met and fell in love, and yet there was ONE scene that was good, the rest was awful. Maybe the empathy came over dinners commiserating on their choosing this script. Save your money OR go buy 'Miami Rhapsody' instead, it actually IS a comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"The title's a pun!","review":"Two Much. Get it? There are two women involved and the screenwriter has used his God-given talents to assimilate this tidbit of information with the common phrase \\"too much\\" (as in an excess) to arrive at the pun \\"Two Much.\\" I don't mean to mock, but having watched this movie I feel I can rightly surmise that there must be a village out there somewhere missing an idiot because he was responsible for this. The humor has its moments, but is generally predictable and stale. I really can't make any accurate guesses at the intelligence on the scriptwriters, but their density much be such that light can bend around them. This film is cliche, poorly acted, and just plain bad. There are innumerable things that one can do with two hours and I suggest you partake in one of those things. Just please, do not watch this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst film for Banderas","review":"It's beyond me how some people call this movie descent. The movie SUCKS!!!

I keep tinder and a blast match in one. Pad, pen, toboggan, and bag balm in another. Knife, talcum powder and tiger balm in another. Plus, I manage to keep a small mess kit under the tent. And that's just for camping. The two open slots on the side will hold a 1-liter canteen. And the rainshield is nice too, because then you don't have to waterproof it.

I thought it was a rip off at that price. The pieces are made of soft plastic and are way too large for the flimsy cardboard board that comes with the set. The Knight pieces barely stand up at all as they are top heavy and poorly balanced.Fortunately the pieces of this set are hollow and we were able to improve our set by using a hot glue gun to glue lead weights inside the base of each piece. Now the pieces are quite playable if one uses a full (tournament-sized) chess board.The current price that this set sells for is obviously due to its value as a collectable item. If you're looking for a playable chess set, note that you can buy far better (more playable) chess sets for just a fraction of what this set sells for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not fun","review":"This set is not only flimsy cheap plastic but also a choking hazard for ages 3 and younger.

Who knows if there is arsenic or lead paint with imported toys like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Cheap Plastic","review":"Harry Potter Wizard's Chess is on of the cheapest chess sets imaginable. Made out of plastic, the pieces don't keep the board weighted down (the board is folded cardboard)and the pieces don't fit too well on the board either.

I had expected it to be much nicer and fanicer than the regular chess games. The board is folded into 4ths and does not lie flat. The pieces won't stay in place.

When I get my set I will probably toss the accompanying board and buy a bigger better one. I'll probably roughen the shiny plastic surfaces of the pieces with maybe a wire brush to give them sort of an antique feel. Then I'll fill the pieces with rock gravel buck shor or fishing sinkers and plaster of paris and glue thick felt on the bottoms. On a classy roomy board the set should be hefty and handsome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price","review":"It really irritates me to read the reviews about the perceived lack of quality of the game.

I cannot believe I just paid $59.00 for this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Harry Potter Toy Available","review":"You simply cannot get a better toy for the price, especially in the 7-10 year old group. What you have here is basically a decent plastic chess set with a cardboard playing board. The pieces are large (2-5 inches; good for smaller hands) and have a nice weight to them. I'm giving this set a high score for durability because the pieces seem pretty indestructible and will probably get lost long before they break or wear out. But the cardboard playing board may need to be replaced or repaired (read: duct taped) after heavy use or rough handling. Kids will love that the pieces look just like the life-sized set Ron played in the first movie. And hey, in my opinion there just isn't a more educational toy than a chess set.

We have enjoyed many games on it since then. I was suprised by the quality of the pieces. They are molded of a durable plastic and shaped like the ones from the life-size game at the end of the first movie. They are large enough for younger players to easily grasp, however the knights are a little to large. Moving them does take some caution as they tend to knock over the other pieces. The board is made of hard plastic and folds to fit in the box. We really enjoy this game and intend to continue playing it for some years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cd!","review":"Tracks...1) Redemption Song2) Flow3) Think With Your Heart4) Stella By Starlight5) Make Believe6) Andaluz7) Marrakesh8) Tune In 'D'9) The Journey Home10) Let It Grow"},{"rating":"2","title":"Competent","review":"This is not the most complete book on living and working in Portugal but deserves full marks for what it is, a very clear and concise guide.

The acting is superb and it is an amazing story line. I watched it over and over again and couldn't stop. I love the way one boy changs the life of a man in so many ways. Congratulations to newcomer Brown he was perfect for the part and he portrayed the character very well. This should be added to everyones DVD collention. A definete MUST SEE!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful movie","review":"Wonderfully done, I cannot say enough about it. The plot was anything but cliche, the characters memorable, and the entire storyline was done without even one scene containing a half nude female. An excellent movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"predictable and cliche","review":"Despite the talent of its main actors, this movie was nothing but cliche. Every section of the storyline was predictable (e.g. the boy is told not to do something, and he does it), not to mention tacky Hollywood sub-plots (the boy's love interest, the man's sorrowful past, the school wanting the boy for his basketball ability). Half of this movie feels like deja vu, after 'Good Will Hunting'.And it's such a shame, because Rob Brown (the lead actor who wasn't even an actor when he got the part) is so very talented. Let's hope he gets another chance to make a good movie. Thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long and cliche","review":"Wow....another movie where you expect so much more!!! The story line was a great idea but after the first 20 mins the movie just starts rolling down hill. It becomes predictable and long! I wanted to like the movie but in the end I was sadly disapointed. And the kid that played Jamal NEVER smiled what is up with that?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finding Forrester","review":"Finding Forrester is a great movie in which the writer tries to show how people are so easily misunderstood and judged before they are known. Sean Connery plays a frustrated writer who never leaves his home and only publishes one novel that he has wrote. Rob Brown plays an excellent role as a 16-year-old black kid from the Bronx who has a remarkable writing talent, as well as basketball skills. The movie is about how these totally different, but more alike than they first realize, men find each other and change each others lives forever. Finding Forrester is a sad movie but one that inspires us to dream and never doubt the power of friendship."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie isTERR-ible.","review":"Finding Forrester? It's probably best to leave this one unfound. How could Gus Van Sant go from Good Will Hunting to this? Just awful. Trite and predictable.

My wife has wanted to see it for some time and I finally relented.Hell I wanted to see Charlie's Angels. But I have to say that I was amazed at how good it was. I thought while watching it that it had a similar idea to Good Will Hunting. A movie that I only thought was ok and very over-rated. Maybe it just didn't connect with me like Finding Forrester did. I thought the story was very clever, and above all the acting was incredible. The only one in the whole film who I thought was lacking was the love interest. Everyone keeps telling me how great she is because of The Piano. But her acting to me is dull, flat and utterly without emotion. The film is a wonderful mix of drama, laughs and the human heart. An enchanting film all round.

The relationship between Wallace and Forrester was contrived. There were moments of brilliance, but mostly this movie was slow and dull. The closing credits music by IZ was very nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful with real people","review":"Too many movies today consist of 2 dimentional cartoon characters. Rarely does a film come along that has real humans facing real issues with real depth. I found that in \\"Good Will Hunting\\". I have just found it in \\"Finding Forrester\\". The characters are not as deep or as compelling as Good Will BUT nonetheless they are better than 99% of what Hollywood puts out. I would highly recommend to those who are not in the mood for shallow characters and over the top special effects.Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie teens","review":"teens like the movie I did as well .

Every time Mr. Connery is paired with a gifted, less well known actor he seems to bring out the best in both of them and Finding Forrester is no exception. F.

This is a well-made movie marred by massive reliance on cliche, and an abundance of plot holes. The biggest plot hole -- why is William Forrester's novel so beloved? We really aren't shown or told, and it seems like the screenwriter is relying on the viewer identifying Forrester's work with The Catcher in the Rye. Also, Forrester's writing lesson is ridiculous. He basically tells Jamal to type anything, and let that stand as a first draft. Forrester's \\"advice\\" is, of course, a paraphrase of Truman Capote's put-down of Jack Kerouac's method. It's just laughable to have Hollywood enshrine a withering put-down as the model of good writing. The romantic subplot between Jamal and Anna Paquin's character is undernourished and stunted. F. Murray Abraham is OK, but the denouement is a hideous and cliched set piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"A chain of cliches","review":"The biggest problem with this movie is that it begins with strong momentum, bringing your critical defenses down. Then you are accepting and start to like it a little. Finally, towards the end of the film, you feel foolish, completely taken advantage of, because you realize that it is pure garbage from the start. When will Hollywood stop propagating racial stereotypes?"},{"rating":"2","title":"a fine, fine flick","review":"I had never heard of this movie until it was given to me this past Christmas. I was intrigued by the stellar cast, but suspicious of the story as it was described on the jacket - man, was I fooled.It was a marvelous experience with superb acting and story line and I particularly enjoyed the music, especially the singing as the endingcredits rolled by.

(natural) circles can become ingrown. For example, if you have followed the show \\"Friends\\", you probably noticed that everyone on the show has dated and slept with pretty much everyone else\\".Actually, they haven't - they almost did in some cases, but only Chandler/Monica and Ross/Rachel really did get together in that way, and they were together for good at the end of the 10th season."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Makes Sense of the World!!","review":"If you've ever struggled to understand a guy (or a girl, as the case may be), your struggles are over! With the practical analogy of spaghetti and waffles, Bill and Pam Farrel make gender differences a thing to be grasped. With humor gracing the pages, the authors go through and explain how and why women and men do the things they do. In addition, they give practical advice of how to interact with and treat a member of the opposite gender. In addition, because this is a Christian book, it goes through how we were created differently for different purposes, and how the effects of the Fall individually affected men and women.

The Hardys go to Iceland, walk around there getting into one problem after another with things that have nothing to do with any mystery. This book was about a bunch of dumb things that happened to the brothers. Somebody would have a crisis upon the conclusion of each chapter which was overcome at the start of the following chapter. WOW! Throw out the sleeping pills! For less money you can aquire a copy of The Arctic Patrol Mystery. Guaranteed to make you yawn or your money back. This book is a filler. Buy it to complete your collection - read it once (And wish you hadn't - life is short) and go on to something else. How in heck can ANYONE call this rubbage a mystery story????

Just to clarify - I did not like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book Ever","review":"This WAS the worst book in the set, close runner up was Aztec Warrior.

Don't bother reading this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of Thought","review":"This book was the worst of The original 58 Hardy Boys. It lacked thought and skillful writing. All the suspense was created with potential dangers such as a car crash, a boat crash, someone falling, at the end of each chapter only to be rescued at the start of the next. Big Deal! I could write that. This book lacked an intricate plot that are found in so many of the other books. Very boring, unsuspenseful reading.

As for a horror movie I can only say they should have rated it PG-13, its definetly a movie for teenagers not adults. If you liked movies like \\"Scream\\" and \\"I know What You Did Last Summer\\", you may actually like this movie. I wouldn't reccomend renting it, watch it when it comes out on t.v. I love werewolf movies and have seen practically all of them, this ranks as one of the worst. If want a good werewolf movie watch \\"The Howling\\"(my favorite), \\"Bad Moon\\" is also quite good although it has some flaws, but the werewolf in it is, for lack of a better word, Awsome.

DON'T OVERLOOK THIS MOVIE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Bad Werewolf Flick","review":"This movie is sequel in name only to the werewolf classic film \\"An American Werewolf in London\\". The plot is silly. The bad guys are goofy rather than menacing. The ending has to be one of the lamest that I have ever seen for a horror movie. The only things I liked about this movie were the werewolf effects and the delicious Julie Delpy. This movie was made in the 1990s and stands as proof that the decade served as a dry spell for good horror films. Buy at your own risk!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AwSOME OMVIE","review":"I KNOW alot of people hated the movie.. but i personally loved it! It had really cool specail effects! I mean the were wolf might not look that real.. but i personally think that it looks awsome! but i really think that the werewolf should look more wolfie and not big and muscualr and bulky.. it should look like a mix of Bad Moon and the were wolf in this movie.. that wouldn've rocked. But the movie is over with. So no changes can be Made.. I think you guys should all see this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What The?","review":"This movie is bad!

The Werewolves looked terrible, the acting was worse then bad, the directing was crappy, the writing was annoying and everything else falls apart. the best scene is near the end in the train.....Other then that, I hated it.

The absolute all time cham-peen worst movie I have ever seen. How bad you may ask? There is NOTHING redeeming about this movie. This movie self-destructs on so many levels it makes a critical analysis difficult. I mean it. It's not even \\"so stupid it's funny\\" like \\"Deep Blue Sea\\" or \\"The Fast and the Furious\\". This movie makes \\"Beavis & Butthead\\" look like \\"Citizen Kane\\". At the end of the movie I just wanted to cry because I had lost two hours of my life.

Don't even try to compare this to the classic \\"An American Werewolf in London\\". This movie is about as scary as \\"The Naked Gun\\", the acting is pathetic and the plot for this movie is horrible...I can not even bear to rehash it to you. There is nothing creepy or remotely scary about this movie...it is just plain stupid.Also, the werewolves in this movie look like some kind of a joke. I tried to keep an open mind, but basically, I could barely finish this movie and the best thing about it was when it was over and I did not have to watch anymore. Total waste of time. I mean basically, this movie is a total \\"ZERO\\" and my recommendation to you is not to even think of wasting your time on this flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Director's Sophomore outing is not up to snuff","review":"Anthony Waller took the helm of American Werewolf in Paris on the success of his wildly amazing film \\"Mute Witness\\". Everything about \\"Mute Witness\\" was wonderful. It was riveting and an edge-of-your-seat thriller.American Werewolf in Paris is just the opposite. I wanted to like this film, because I was nuts about Waller's first film. Here, however, the director, the producer, or the studio - or all three [messed] this film up horribly. The story-line is pitifully infantile - which Werewolf in London wasn't. Further the CGI werewolves are so badly created that they look not unlike cartoon characters (similar to Roger Rabbit).I hope and pray we get better results from Waller again and that his brilliance isn't just lightning in a bottle.Don't bother!"},{"rating":"2","title":"3.5 stars out of 5 stars","review":"Good plot. Campy horror and comedy blended together. CGI werewolves sometimes appear too much like \\"videogame\\" graphics to actually scare viewers.

But there is a beautiful woman who is going to commit suicide by jumping. One of the boys jumps to her rescue. But her secret is she is a werewolf and accidentally infects him.Well, it turns out that there is a pack of werewolves in Paris and they feed on Americans. (Let's talk obvious stereotyping.) While at times it is good (especially when Julie Delpy is on screen).Don't waste your time watch the original!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck; they should have left well enough alone","review":"I was eager to see this movie, having loved the original \\"American Werewolf\\" movie; but was sadly disappointed. I didn't care at all for the characters, the humor was missing completely and generally it stank up the screen. Mark me off if you don't agree - I know you rude lot will anyway - but that's my story and I'm sticking to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An In Depth Look at Teddy Roosevelt","review":"This in depth biography gives a side of Teddy Roosevelt that most people do not know about. It lists events that not only helped shaped his political career and social image, but events that gave a more personal view of the President, from his childhood asthma to his physical weaknesses. The book speaks of his thoughts, opinions, and views on several topics, such as art, nature, sports (football), his marriage, and great literature. Had T.R. lived to read this biography about him, I am sure he would have regarded it as a great work of literature, that may have been to long, but gave a great view of the legend, Theodore Roosevelt."},{"rating":"2","title":"This song had a great impact on my life","review":"I have realized how this song relates to life.

An aristocratic, beautiful girl from New England takes the entertainment world by storm with her unique charm and iron resolve. Sound familiar? The \\"I don't wear cheap furs\\" scene had me choking with laughter, along with what I call the \\"drunken best of Shakespeare\\" scene where she launches into a chamgagne-fueled random explosion of highlights from \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" and \\"Hamlet\\" at a party for top theatre execs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as you think","review":"Old movie, made very little sense.

This book, unfortunately, completely failed my expectations. Unless you are a fanatic of theological disputes or a specialist in religious trends, you do not need to spend your money on the book. The previus reviewer has very precisely formulated the thoughts the book evoked in me. The sect seems to be doomed from the start and as they are drawn so one-dimensially, you feel absolutely no pity...

Cheryl Greider- Bradkin, Ami Simms, Helen Kelley, Merikay Waldvogel, Margaret Miller, Marta Amundson, Flavin Glover and Jan Myers-Newbury. We learn to make a seminole sweatshirt, improve your quilting stitch, ribbonwork reverse applique, date quilts, blooming quilt grids, pieced collar with seminole ribbons, log cabin variations, and hand-dyeing fabric. I enjoyed the information on dyeing fabric and was disappointed in the rest. There are quite a few pictures of scenery, the ocean, forest, meadows, mountains. I guess somehow that belongs in a quilting book? There are some nice photo's of old quilts. I won't be making anything from this book but perhaps you will. I don't think it's worth more than a couple dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect for a Trailer","review":"The book provides a reasonable overview of the history of this sort of construction and provides basic techniques and information about tools and materials needed. Little attention is spent on construction from materials other than melamine, with the result that the products displayed look \\"bottom-of-the-line\\"--little to encourage you to build in this design. This was a great disappointment. I was hoping for a discussion of how to build handsome, European-style cabinets. Given the limited information of use, it was mostly a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it","review":"My partner and I loved this album and have played it endlessly. We discovered new artists we hadn't heard such as John Gorka and Greg Brown. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"big disappointement","review":"How I expected this double cd!!! but I should have known that tributes these days are three a penny and very rarely they seem to convince. It seems that many famous people were invited to this party and when they came not really dressed as they should and not really in the mood nobody could tell them to leave. Such is the cover of Springsteen, almost to make you weep. A bizarre reggae song by Jackson Browne and Bonnie Raitt (Did Seeger write that?) and many etcetera. Not all is lost, Greg Brown, John Gorka and Anni difranco give some good songs, but even these songs would be considered fillers in any of their albums. Before you buy this cd try to listen to it at a friends. I consider it the disappointement of the year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where have all the Flowers gone - by Pete Seeger","review":"CD was in great shape - but dull in content. I was not impressed wtih his rendition on this CD. BORING."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an amazing tribute...","review":"In agreeing with all the other top-star reviews in this list, I want to add that part of what makes Pete Seeger such a treasure is the timelessness of his writing. Reggae Pete? Why not! Like Shakespeare, adapting classics for modern tastes only emphasizes their universality. This tribute makes it clear that Pete's music belongs in the global culture, for all generations present and future to discover and make their own.On a separate note, I want to direct America-centric readers to the work of Tommy Sands, a great friend of Pete's who sings the title song. North-of-Ireland Irish, Tommy follows in Pete's peace-activist footsteps, and deserves the international recognition he has received for his work... Slàinte!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen to the lyrics and know there are teachers among us.","review":"This is a truly an inspirational & awesome CD collection. After listening to both CD's I sat back and thought there truly ARE teachers among us, IF we would but LISTEN to the message. I had not really appreciated Pete Seeger's work until now, as I see where we have been and think about where we SHOULD be going. Thank you for the message. I believe this collection of work will become classic. Pete Seeger deverves to be PROUD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Variety and Inspirational Songs","review":"Pete Seeger is the genuine article. A man who has devoted his life to using his gifts and talents to do his part to make the world a more humane place. His music sung by him is a unique contribution. This album combining Seeger's own voice with a fine collection of collaborators honoring him may even be better. If not better, at least more engaging when listening to the whole album thanks to the variety of voices and stylings. If you want pure Pete Seeger, he has plenty for you. If you are interested in a fresh and honest interpretation of his work, this is a good source."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably fine on a console, but not on PC","review":"This game seems to have been written for console platforms with the PC version as an afterthought. The graphics are Playstation-esque even at high resolution and the gameplay is more like console shooters than recent PC games (checkpoints instead of savegames, etc.). Add in severely anemic sound effects, comical character models, jerky gameplay (even on smoking fast machines), confusing missions, and a healthy dose of bugs (I ran one whole mission with my entire squad glued together like something from John Carpenter's The Thing. Hilarious but not much use in a firefight.) and Men of Valor makes for a big waste of money.On the plus side the fire effects and explosions look really good, but save your money and download some screenshots instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Call of Duty wanna be","review":"This game sure gives me the feeling of \\"been there, done that\\" in its gameplay. I am refering to Medal Of Honor and Call of Duty, except those games had a decent game-save feature. Here you have to wait for the game to automatically save itself because you can't. The result is that when you're killed you must replay the same action again and again until you get it right and can proceed. It even has the little compass so you'll know which direction to go, which is only another way of saying that this is a super linear game. It might appear to be a great big jungle for you to explore, but there is really only one way for you to go. This copy-cat game can be fun at times, but the feeling of deja-vu transcends the experience. This game is completely unoriginal and, if you really want to try it, just wait for the price to drop before you get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"this game sucks","review":"i can't even play it because every time i try to install the game it either crashes my computer , which is brand new , or it gives me all kinds of error codes.no customer support or help is within reach.if you don't believe me , log on to the official website and enter the forums to see how many unhappy people besides me there are !!!!!!!!!!!!

The craftsmanship on the \\"ABC\\" puzzle is inferior to that of the \\"123\\" one. The ABC pieces are only painted on the front side, with the sides and backs being only unfinished wood, whereas on the \\"123\\" puzzle pieces were painted on front, back and side. Sounds like a little thing, but with the wear and tear little ones give the pieces, it makes a big difference.

My son (28 months old) just kind of looked at it and then got up and walked away after trying to fit a couple pieces in spots they didn't fit. And he LOVES these puzzles but it was clear he was as confused as I was trying to look at it.I ended up taking all the pieces out, painting the board all black except for the slots the letters fit into and voila!

He mastered all the basic ones with farm animals and shapes, so I bought this hoping it would be a challenge. It is definitely harder than the others and it takes patience to put in all the letters. He usually makes it through 7 or 8 before he gets bored and moves on to other activities. The negative on this toy is you will definitely find little wooden letters all over your home. The positive is - your child will start to learn the letters.

This one is also very well-made.Unlike some of their other chunky puzzles, the puzzle pieces are not painted. Instead, the printed letters are glued to the pieces. The glued paper hasn't peeled at all, though, and these pieces won't chip like the painted ones do.I gave this puzzle to my daughter at 22 months. It wasn't too much of a challenge, and she absolutely loved it. For each letter, there are pictures of two things that begin with that letter.

It was great fun and he loved carrying letters around. Obviously, most of them got lost after traveling with him to the park and daycare. The puzzle was of great quality, durable, with bright colors - no complaints. So, now that I have a daughter, I decided to buy her the same exact puzzle and was very surprised to receive something different. Unlike the old puzzle, each letter has been painted only on the front. The edges of the letters are unpainted and very rough and the back of the letters are unpainted, though not so rough. I don't think it could give my daughter a splinter, but it just isn't so pleasant for the little fingers to touch, let alone putting it in her mouth (just unavoidable). I wonder if I just received a defective one. The problem is - I already opened it and sending it back would be a hassle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Fantastic Toy and Learning Tool","review":"I was very happy when my son received this puzzle as a gift.

I've been happy that my young son was able to put the puzzle together sooner than I thought he'd be able to.

I saw him in concert7 years ago and he was awesome. This product showcases the audience more than it does the artist.One or two audience participation/sing-a-log songs is OK, but a dozen? Come on Stevie, the crowdcame to hear you. He didn't do this 7 years ago. I believe that the death of his mother two yearsago has greatly changed his slant towards music and performing. The audience sings on half of his songs,while he simply plays along. That is not the Stevie Wonder that I know. This could have beenone of the truly great DVDs/Blu-Ray discs of all-time, but it is flawed due to the above."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: Sound not great, highly compressed.","review":"Lots of other great reviews on the content and song selection. But if you are a fan of great sound and concert videos, think twice before purchasing or consider a rental. The audio is highly highly compressed and just doesn't sound that great.

It's probably the best out of the batch which shocked me. There's many reasons I give this 5 stars...Stevie sounds incredible, he has a tighter band than some jazz fusion groups out there right now, and the setlist choices were dynamite on this DVD. The show is over 2 hours long, and he plays a lot of his album \\"Hotter Than July\\" which I thought was awesome. You can see some stars in the audience dancing throughout the show, and they show an equal amount of screen time for all members of the band. Stevie's daughter Aisha joins him throughout the entire show on backup vocals. I Haven't caught the group in concert yet but I plan to after watching this. 5 STARS, a must have if you are a Stevie Wonder fan or a general R&B/Funk fanatic."},{"rating":"2","title":"stevie in rare form","review":"great picture and sound the selections great in DTS,2hrs of stevie classics best stevie wonder dvd ever.

Got it three days agoand have looked it several times and can't stop viewing and listening.Fortunately I'm in holiday and weather isn't so fine as its was the days before I purcchsed item.The only thing I cant understand: I can hear all the small percussion (bells , chimes, shakers and all the stuff), but I'm not capable to hearcongas although I see the players playing them. Same with both guitars.Can see them playing, but cant hear them only soloing. Is it as I have \\"only\\"a 2-chanell unit? But what a nonsense. Congas and guitars - coming from background?But what the heck-Listen and enjoy Stevie and his bandmates.It's unbeleivable. Party with auditions participation.

I saw a version of this concert in DC and Stevie did Stevie, not the Rolling Stones, Beetles, or traditional Jazz tunes ...just R&B Stevie.

This is perfect for people like me who are physically unable to make the concerts in person due to others standing during most of the concert and blocking the view from those of us who are unable to stand. I wish other R&B;/soul artist would consider doing this.This dvd gives you shots from all angles! Close ups you wouldn't see at the actual concert. I'm thankful that I did see Stevie at least 3 times when I was younger and physically able. Stevie is an artist who gives you your moneys worth! Being from the old school, THERE'S NO LIP-SYNCHING and REAL music!!! Now, with this dvd, I can see and hear him in concert mode as often as I wish! How sweet is that???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stevie Wonder: Live at Last","review":"This is probably the best rock/pop-/jazz concert I have ever seen. Not only is Stevie Wonder great, but all the musicians are absolutely top-flight. His daughter Aisha Morris (for whom the song \\"Isn't She Lovely\\" was written) does a solo vocal number that is sweet and sensitive, and the other backup singers are fanastic as well. I would recommend this wholeheartedly to anyone who enjoys Stevie Wonder or this type of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"great stuff","review":"a must see for all of stevie's fans. great music and perfect picture, your money's worth for a concert you can never attend.need i say more, get it now !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My new favorite DVD","review":"Have probably fifty or more DVD concerts.

For those expecting the sweeping majesty of 'Bittersweet Symphony' or the interstellar starshooting of 'A Storm in Heaven' beware Richard is happy.This may be good news for him, but spells disaster for the rest of us. 'Alone with everybody' is an album that makes Richard Clayderman sound like Napalm Death. Harsh but fair. Avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Get My Beat from Richard!","review":"Mr. Ashcroft is very talented! Hands down! And it shows on songs like \\"New York\\" with is churning guitar chords and trance inducing chorus, or with the \\"Velvet Morning\\" sounding \\"Slow Was My Heart.\\" But while he makes great music on this c.d., an average song rears it's average head here and there. The first track, \\"A Song for the Lovers\\", just doesn't sit well on this album, espically at the lead. And tracks 6-8 (\\"Crazy World\\", \\"On a Beach\\", and \\"Money to Burn\\") just kinda' sit there adding girth and length to what could have been a great c.d. I know I seem extra negative, given the fact I awarded 4 stars, but once you listen to Mr. Ashcroft you'll understand that the good he produces outweights the bad in an almost eternal sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great singers w/o great guitartists dot dot dot","review":"Poor Richard, a super talented singer from a superior band--The Verve: he's still \\"talented\\" just not great. One great song--Crazy World--lots of posturing. Massive, wonderful voice; mediocre lyrics. Singer leaves The Band. too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Richard Ashcroft is lost on the Westway","review":"As a Verve fan who has practically worn down the grooves on my Verve CDs with constant play, I was eagerly looking forward to Richard's first solo outing. Well, that was a mistake. To put it bluntly, this CD is a dog. It is tedious and overproduced beyond belief with only one song that I really like (New York, despite its naff lyrics). Wherever you are, come back, Nick McCabe, come back! Mad Richard didn't mean it, really. Come back and stop this man from ever making another solo album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull melodies, insipid lyrics and self-indulgent all-around.","review":"To all you fellow fans of the three strong albums released by The Verve: what are you hearing in Richard Ashcroft's first solo album that I'm not? After about five listenings, not one song sticks out (maybe \\"New York,\\" which sort of reminds me of the U2 song of the same title), and the entire album leaves me cold. Almost every song goes on too long, and Ashcroft seemingly has forgotten how to write a rousing chorus, ala \\"Weeping Willow\\" or \\"Lucky Man.\\" The absence of Verve guitarist extraordinaire, Nick McCabe, is especially missed.Normally I review every album by a particular band in order of release, and, if you're interested, I reviewed the three Verve albums, awarding each four or five stars. However, even though people say that Ashcroft's second solo effort is better than his first, after spending too much time with \\"Alone With Everybody,\\" there are just so many other albums I'd rather buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 STARS! C'mon people, buy this CD!","review":"Buy this CD! You won't regret it. After seeing the video for \\"C'mon People (We're Making it Now)\\" on M2 I knew I had to have this album. I mean, that's a great song, and I don't ever hear Richard Ashcroft on the radio. Thank you, M2!! My personal favorite tracks on this CD are the aforementioned tune, as well as \\"A Song for the Lovers\\" and \\"I Get My Beat,\\" but there are NO bad songs on this album. It's just a matter of some being better than others-but they're all very good. I bought this CD a few days ago and can't get enough of it-it's a must-have for any music lover. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Judge this CD on its won merit","review":"Forget the naysayers who, through thinly veiled criticism, bemoan the fact that this record is not another Verve record (or somehow not worthy of attention from an Oasis fan). Leave the baggage behind and take this offering on its own terms. You may notice that most of the adverse comments to \\"Alone\\" appear to come from those enamored with the Verve and seemingly irritated with Ashcroft's role in the demise of the group. In this instance, take such comments as you would those of the supposedly neutral Olympic judge who sees flaws which no one else can see. Simply put, this album is exceptional. The Verve may have been louder--but not necessarily more complex (or simplistic) musically. Actually, Ashcroft's effort to make the songs more \\"user friendly\\" is the same reason this effort is better than any Verve offering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!!!!!","review":"I recently picked this CD up while in London on business. I heard \\"A Song for the Lovers\\" on the radio and was blown away by the depth of it. The other tracks are equally powerful. The smoothness of his lyrics and melodies are fabulous. I could (and am) listen to this CD over and over without tiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy World","review":"This is a strange album. It has a very Verve feel to it yet it is different. My first thoughts were that all the tracks were too similar but everytime I hear it, I find something new. I just can't take it out of my car. I love all the tracks but everytime \\"Crazy World\\" fades out, I can't help skipping back to it a couple of times. This is driving music. If you don't have a car (convertible prefered), don't buy it - you won't do it justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good, but 2nd fiddle to \\"urban hymns\\".","review":"This is not as good as \\"urban hymns\\". But it is VERY good still. \\"Urban Hymns\\" was probably a \\"perfect\\" album...hard to beat...The Verve fans will like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ashcroft in Love","review":"Wow. I wasn't quite sure what he would do for the solo album, but AWE confirms what many of us have known for some time: Richard Ashcroft is one of music's best songwriters. The mix of country, blues and soul found on this album will remind you of his work on 'Urban Hymns,' but with the new perspective of a man whose life has been drastically altered by love. 'On a Beach' will make your head spin, the swirling guitar lines headed straight for the sky; 'Everyone' and 'You On My Mind' are odes to the beauty of love and life expressed in the sort of poetic way only Richard can manage. What could have been sappy in less talented hands makes me stop what I'm doing and just listen, and no album since 'Urban Hymns' has made me do that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! A definite pleaser for Verve fans!","review":"It always makes me upset to see great bands split. Usually the creative fission of the band members surpases anything any one member of the band can do. And so with the Verve broken up, I was worried. Never fear! Richard Ashcroft, singer from that band has produced a strong and worthy first solo effort. What does it sound like? Well it sounds alot like Urban Hymns, but less anthemic and more lush. There are great string arrangements on very catch songs, that sound better with every listening. The overall mood is mellow, and some people may find it lacks bite. No one song stands up to bittersweet symphony, but hey that's probably one of the 10 best songs of the nineties. In summary, you'll love this if you like the Verve ballads or if you are a fan of good lush pop music."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS ALBUM SUCKS.....I USED IT TO CURE MY INSOMNIA","review":"Ok when i bought this mess when it came out i cried myself to sleep for like a month. What the hell was this man smoking when he wrote these tunes??? Every single song is basically a snooze fest whining about love, his wife, then more love, then his wife. The only song I can even stand is NEW YORK probably cause it's somewhat similar to The Verve's material. I have been a fan of Mad Rich since 1994 and I enjoy ballads(ON your Own,History,etc), but every song on here is like 10 minutes of prissy, over produced, cheesy elevator music for the musically impaired. Buy this \\"work of art\\" only if you are a die hard Ashcroft fan, or you need a cure for insomnia.See you in the next one"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs Guitars.","review":"BORING BORING BORING.Solo aritsts are never a good idea.I think The verve need to make one last album."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than urban hymns","review":"This is a great record from a great artist. There is no questioning Ashcroft's voice, and the tunes here are better than Urban Hymns. Found here are sweeping strings, psychedelic layering, and a mesmerising flow. The songs all clock in around 5-6 min., but none are too long, and the endings to each song seem to be the best parts. \\"Crazy World\\" is my favorite, its got an addictive, pleading chorus. This record has the atmosphere of a Bernard Butler album(writing honest songs, mostly about your wife). If you are a fan of the british wall of sound pop aesthetic(like the verve had), give this one a spin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the Verve, but that's ok","review":"Richard Ashcroft has put together a superb album with Alone With Everybody. However, anyone that thinks it is simply an informal follow-up album to the last (and great) Verve album will be sorely disappointed. While there is a lot on this album that is reminiscent of the Verve, Richard Ashcroft has gone in bold new directions and has certainly expanded on old Verve concepts. Because of that, this album is highly enjoyable. And it is definitely a cure for the recent \\"pop music blues\\" that have dominated the radio, MTV, record stores, etc. Check this album out if you want to hear exciting things, but if you're expecting the Verve be sure to listen to it first!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The next best thing...","review":"It's very good but it isn't The Verve; it's different in some ways and the same in others and on the whole, quite good. As you might expect, missing are those wide-open rave/groove bass lines -- perfected on Verve songs like Rolling People and Come On (and I admit, I miss them)-- but remaining are Richard Ashcroft's formidable songwriting abilities and musicianship. The arrangements are thoroughly produced, and are most similar to the more ballad-like Verve songs (penned by Ashcroft), e.g., The Drugs Don't Work, Sonnet, etc. I can't help but compare this album to Morrissey after The Smiths, it's very good and definitely worth purchasing, but it's not quite the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nick McCabe gets the last laugh.","review":"This isn't a bad album, I wanted to give 2.5 stars. A Song for Lovers is a good opening track. The real gems are Brave New World, and On A Beach. They seemed to be influence by Nick McCabe. New York sounds cool, in A Northern Soul way, but too many cliches, and no Nick McCabe. The two other singles released are both pretty terrible, and pedal steel guitar isn't cool. The 2nd track is cool, but it sounds like they used Zelda video game music in the beginning. The rest of the tracks range from mediocre to okay. The lyrics are a step down from Urban Hymns and A Northern Soul, and the sound took about 5 steps down from A Storm in Heaven and the Verve EP."},{"rating":"2","title":"suburban hymns","review":"you are quite literally blown away by the first 4 songs of this album especially brave new world & new york but then it goes pear shaped with the over long,over produced & quite frankly irratating you on my mind/crazy world but dicky reprieves him self though with the excellent cmon people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Solid Solo Debut","review":"This is a very solid CD from the former lead singer of The Verve. If you liked their last CD, you'll really enjoy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"An extended interview with nuclear bomb engineer Ted Taylor","review":"Like most of McPhee's work, Curve takes the form of aninterview woven together with very readable technicalwriting and travel log. Ted Taylor, an engineer who workedat Los Alamos, and atomic bombs are the subject.Written in 1973, a section addresses the damage a terroristbomb (a fizzle) at the interview site -- The World TradeCenter! -- would produce."},{"rating":"2","title":"ok","review":"Not the best not bad just dated book with old data some historical interest perhaps depends on the point of interest"},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes me glad the cold war is over","review":"As in many of his books,John McPhee and his capacious memory and notebook spend time with interesting people--in this case a man who begins his career designing nuclear weapons at the start of the cold war. Also like others of his books, our intest is captured as much by the personalities as the subject. Besides meeting a fascinating and hightly idiosyncractic physicist, I learned enough nuclear physics from this little book to really liven up my 9th grade physics classes. I gave 4 stars because the book is necessarily dated, but I'm awfully glad we are a step or two further from the brink than some experts at the time expected, since we did not go down the road to using plutonium in nuclear reactors.

Frankly I was expecting the usual bar band rock-blues type of thing, but this blew me away. It was totally engaging. I bought a CD from the band after the show and on my I-pod I'm enjoying it even more with repeated exposure. It's not every day you find a really fresh approach...

Tolkien was a true genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Audio Book","review":"Not quite what I expected. Tolkien reads a great many of the poems and verses that is in the Lord of the Rings and some excerpts from the book.

This is also very good for those who like to explore the background of his imagination, the history of Middle Earth."},{"rating":"2","title":"J. R. R. Tolkien is a great reader of his own work.","review":"It's too bad that Tolkien didn't get a chance to read the whole of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"The Hobbit\\". But, it's wonderful that these recordings survived for us to hear them since they were not professionally made and most were done before \\"Lord of the Rings\\" was even published, let alone popular. Also, also my thanks to who ever decided to put all these on CD. My LPs of these recordings are worn out."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a treat!","review":"To a Tolkien fan since childhood, hearing the author himself reading his material was a somewhat emotional experience. Ideally, the recordings would be a complete reading of the whole LoTR trilogy or more, but even with the clips and bits available they are very much worth the buck.To me, these recordings have confirmed that I have read the books \\"in tune\\" with Tolkien himself, and I feel that to a certain point they confirm that the movie pictures have captured Tolkien rather well, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truely magical!","review":"I absolutely love this group of CDs!

Or whoever was handling the packaging may have accidentally dropped it, which is more likely since the crack resembles the bottle was bashed in.

No arguing it's not designed to be tossed at all (which is why we didn't request a refund/replacement and sucked it up replacing it with a re-purposed Gatorade bottle) and it's probably sturdy enough for you to take to Pilates, but just know it is somewhat brittle and breaks pretty easily when mostly full.

Not having much prof. digital experience, there were a few things I didn't realize & I called 1-800-okcanon while at the rehearsal shoot! Boy, they were great, they walked me through the issues.

I also got the Canon Speedlite 430 EX which worked as it should."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It","review":"I love my 30d. I'm a big Canon fan because you can make things as simple or as complicated as you like. You can shoot in fully automatic to fully manual and many steps in between. There is only one small thing that I don't like about it: the remote shutter control port. It is a 3 prong plug, so it is difficult to plug in and it is easy to bend the prongs out of place. That makes it difficult to assemble at 10pm right before a fireworks display. I previously owned a Rebel 2000 which has a standard single plug just like headphones would have.Apart from that one small criticism, I love the creative flexibility the 30d offers, the nice LCD size, the rapid shutter speed, and the fact that I can use all of my old EF lenses!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Continuing the 20D tradition","review":"The EOS 30D isn't much of an upgrade from the 20D, with a few new features such as true spot metering. If you've already got a 20D, you might as well sit tight and wait for the next generation. (The EOS 5D isn't really an upgrade option for 20D owners if they own many EF-S lenses.) However, the 30D is a major step up for those who own the original Digital Rebel or Rebel XT. It offers a more advanced body, faster operation, and a broad range of customization features.However, I recommend getting the 17-85 IS lens over the 18-55 kit lens, for sharper results and the steadiness of image stabilization."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have had mine for 6 months","review":"First I shopped around a lot and settled on the 30D.

I am still learning different things with photography and every time I want to try something new the Canon 30d is capable and grows with me. I now have 3 lenses with most of my range and have not at any time regretted my decision buying this camera. It is very easy to use also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not to much, not too little... juuust right!","review":"This camera is perfect for my needs. Any more than 8 megapixels makes for file size that chew up my computer's hard drive capacity too quickly. The options and controls give me all the flexibility I could desire in taking pictures. The 5 frames per second exposure rate is great for Little League picture taking, capturing all the action needed. The 1.6 focal length multiplier is also great for my needs, making all of my lenses effectively 60% longer (I don't need wide angle shots often, and am content with panoramas when needed). The low noise, high ISO capabilities have been fantastic to date, and the high shutter speed capability has allowed me to take some great low depth of field exposures on bright days with an f2.8 lens. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best bet for family sports enthusiasts!","review":"The 30D is more than a simple upgrade to the stellar 20D camera, it's now a workhorse. The shutter has been upgraded to 100,000 exposure lifecycle (this is the standard rating of when you'll effectively wear the camera out beyond economical repairs).Combined with the metal construction, this will easily last several years in the hands of an advanced photographer, and can deliver professional results (although not as weatherproof or bulletproof as the Mark II series).The inclusion of the \\"picture styles\\" will be warmly appreciated from old time film users who liked different coloring and sharpness levels dependent on the subject. If you don't like Canon's settings, you can tweak them, or download addition styles from their website.Handling and performance are top-notch, and Canon offers the widest selection of lenses available today. This kit lenses is a good value for the money, but you might consider the EF-S 17-85 if you're budget allows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Camera","review":"I like this camera very much.

I have two lenses: the Canon 50mm mk.II, and the Canon 70-200mm f/2.8L IS. Pictures come out good and after editing I have printed out 20x30s and they look perfect!Be advised, you will need some experiance with photography, because buying a camera like this and keeping it on auto is the biggest waste of money i've ever heard of.If you intend to use a flash, buy a canon speedlight because the internal flash eats up a lot of the 20D's really super long battery life and is not so powerful. High ISOs on this camera still look good, ISO3200 even!This is a SLR camera. That means that the lenses are interchangable. Zoom is all optical on the lens, and the only 'live preview' you will get is in the optical viewfinder. The LCD screen is for reviewing the photos and changing menu settings.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's great, when it works.","review":"I've had this camera for less than a year. I have to ship it out for repair for a fourth time tomorrow. The first three times it went out were for focus problems. This time Canon actually shipped it back to me broken. With a new problem, not even what I send it in for. Each time I send it in it's at least two weeks. They promised me this time a manager would look at it. They promised me that last time and it didn't seem to matter much. To me, it's an expensive piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Major Point to Bring Up.","review":"Enough has been said about this camera. There's full in depth reviews about performance and specs, but one thing that never gets brought up is the LCD live view. I don't understand why canon's cheaper point and shoot cameras have the active LCD where you don't need to look through the viewfinder to shoot, but the 10d, 20d, and 30d all lack this feature which is probably the most convenient as it becomes more versatile when shooting in awkward positions, areas. Now, canon has finally given us the Live LCD with the 40d. Good job canon for taking 5 years to incorporate something that a cheap $100 point and shoot camera already has.

Val Kilmer's performance in this movie was nothing short of amazing. I do not understand how he was not nominated or did not win a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for this role. Kurt Russel also gives a very solid performance as Wyatt Earp. This is one of my favorite westerns of all time but certainly it is the best to come out in the past 20 years. A Blu-Ray release would be awesome and is overdue."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great western, a remarkable movie...","review":"This isn't what the ol' west was all about. This is what Hollywood films are all about: big casts, large conflict, and compelling characters. It's all set to the backdrop of Tombstone, a large town in the ol' west where Wyat Earp and his two brothers decide to retire to and make a small fortune in silver. Doc Holliday also lives there, winning card games like Mark Maguire makes home runs. But the outlaw gang the Cowboys are menacing the town and stirring up trouble. Reluctantly, the Earps and Holliday come out of retirement to fight back and defend their town. This is an extremely remarkable film with great acting, a thick plot, and some suspense-filled shoot-outs. It's a must-see for any movie buff. One of the best westerns also made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hail is coming with me!!!","review":"Hail to the actors and producers of this motion picture!!My wife and I recently visited Tombstone, AZ. and toured the shootout site at The OK Corral which occurred on October 26, 1881. ... .Based on what I read and saw, the movie is generally accurate and based on true facts. The performance of Val Kilmer as the role of Doc Holiday should have been awarded with the best supporting actor in a major role. The Academy either ignored it, or had made a prior commitment to give it to a less deserving actor.The dvd has added feutures such as DTS and 5.1 digital channels. The quality of the picture is pure, crisp and as digital as it comes. In my honest opinion, this is the greatest western movie ever produced. A must in your library. Big thumbs up!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest Westerns ever!","review":"I really did enjoy this movie! The same year that \\"Tombstone\\" played at theaters \\"Wyatt Earp\\" was also released. Both films are very good, but \\"Tombstone\\" edges \\"Wyatt Earp\\" as the better film of the two. The dvd is nice, but a special edition dvd should not be so far away. This title deserves a special edition with additional bonus material. However, the current dvd is the best transfer you will find on the market today. I highly recommend this dvd if you cannot wait for the arrival of a special edition!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST western film ever","review":"I'm not usually a big fan of westerns but this film is incredible! Val Kilmer shines on this one but the cast is great. We have a huge flat of Doc Holiday in our studio and even had it on stage during our first show together. Since then Doc Holiday's taken a shot from a drumstick but that's the price you pay for 161bpm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me?","review":"Wow, Blu-Ray just isn't all it's purported to be. Tell me why, a disc that is supposed to able to hold 6X the information than a standard DVD is merely used to hold the bare minimum for a film. Oh I know, the movie studios want to gouge you for all the money they can. Notice this BR is NOT the Director's Edition of the film. So some day in the future, they'll release it again and expect you to buy it in it's Director's version. Um no. I think I'll keep the Vista Series Director's Cut and skip this.Also, have you noticed that Amazon, rather than have a clear and empty comment section for this version of the film, continue to post the comments from the various prior editions.

GET IT! It's money well spent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Val Kilmer is an artist","review":"What can I say? Val Kilmer graces the screen in this stylish, sophisticated, and highly entertaining Western. I've been told he studied this role (as he does all his roles)for an extensive period of time, and the results are truly incredible. From the witty \\"Does this mean we're not friends? Because, Ed, if I didn't think I was your friend...I just don't think I could bear it!\\" to the inscrutable \\"I'm your huckelberry\\" I left this movie repeating the lines in my head. Thank you Mr. Kilmer for your portrayal of this hardcore, slightly tempered, gunfighter with a deathwish. As for the other characters, I could love em or leave em. Billy Bob Thornton's 10 minute portrayal of Johnny Tyler is spectacular and Michael Biehn's \\"Johnny Ringo\\" is superb. Although jazzed up a bit, real historical accounts tell these same stories. What a romantic, sinister period of our history, and Tombstone truly and masterfully represents it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"tombstone","review":"One of the greatest westerns ever made.Val Kilmer should have received an Oscar for his protrayal of Doc Holliday"},{"rating":"2","title":"this is what i want for a \\"tombstone\\"","review":"of the 2 movies that came out about wyatt earp that year \\"tombstone\\" is the better made better shot and better acted of the pair. i won't get into the plot you should know that by now, but i will say this is the closeest any film has come to getting it right. as for acting most people say val kilmer is the best as doc but if you ask me kurt russell wins hands down as a very human and family loving man who is pushed beyond what he can take and uses his power to get payback, and does he ever. this is one that belongs in your western collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Western","review":"This is another take on the shootout at the O.K. Corral. This movie could be called Doc Holiday as Val Kilmer steals the show in this one. Kurt Russell plays a convincing Wyatt Earp. Sam Elliot plays a crusty Virgil Earp and Bill Paxton spits out a few lines as he tries to play Morgan Earp. Together they band together to bring law and order to Tombstone and take down the ruthless gang of Cowboys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor DVD product","review":"The movie is greatly condensed and is like a copy right infringed movie, incorrectly called pirating sold outside the US.

Val K. was great as Doc Holiday!"},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing film","review":"I thought this was one of the best movies I ever saw. This movie wasn't exactly true to the facts, but who cares! Val Kilmer was amazing as the infamous Doc Holliday. Even with his pale skin and constant coughing he was unbelieveably sexy. His southern accent didn't hurt either. The rest of the cast was great too, esp. Sam Elliot as Virgil Earp. One drawback of the film was that it made it look like it all happened in a couple of weeks when it was really about two years. Also, Josephine and Wyatt's relationship was a bit more involved throughout their time in Tombstone. But who really cares about everything they did wrong? Everything they did right made it spectacular!"},{"rating":"2","title":"topcat1951","review":"This is one of the best westerns made.The only flaw is the sound track 2.0 in todays world.All the older good movies from the 60s,70s,80s,and the 90s are in DTS or Dolby Digital why not Tombstone?I hope they rerelease it in 5.1 or DTS or both.Thats my only gripe about the move.I agree with all the reviews except the one with 1 star,dont know what he watched.This is a must see,and is as good as the Wild Bunch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pale horse, pale rider","review":"This same movie has been made and remade so often that there is a \\"traditional version\\" , an \\"historical version \\" and a \\"romantic version\\".In this version the US marshal Wyatt Earp hunts down the red sash cowboys after they kill his brother by shooting him in the back in a pool hall.This takes place well after the famous shoot out at the O. K. Corral.In the traditional version his brother is shot before the O.K.

Cosmatos made undoubtedly his masterpiece, although the occupied place by My Darling Clementine still remains unmatchable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Movie Ever Made","review":"Love the DVD. My VCR tape finally wore out. I can really understand the words better- much clearer than the tape.This is a must have in every home if you like a good action packed movie that has serious moments, good laughs and great lines about how to think about life and living in it.Val Kilmer, Kurt Russell and Sam Elliott at their best."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Top Western","review":"There are few westerns that can compare to this film. It is vastly underrated and Val Kilmer gives a bravo performance as Doc Holliday. The only western that comes to mind that compares is \\"The Searchers\\". And it's not really fair to compare any western to \\"The Searchers\\". Kurt Russell is totally believable as Wyatt Earp and if not for Val Kilmer, should have at least been mentioned for the Academy Award. He's that good. Westerns do not fair well in Hollywood. \\"The Unforgiven\\" not withstanding. Russell always gives a believable performance and it's time he is recognized. I must admit, that any western with Sam Elliot can't be bad. In fact a couple of years ago Elliot would have been the perfect \\"Wyatt Earp\\". There's alot of action, but it does not overwelm the storytelling here. In short, don't just rent this film, go out and buy it. It's a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the ish!","review":"This movie is the best i have seen in a long time. the seller os very professional and a great place to buy from"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie, suspicious of the Blu-Ray transfer....","review":"I can't tell you anything about Tombstone you don't already know.

Maybe it's me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tombstone: the way it was meant to be viewed","review":"I just bought and watched the blu-ray version of Tombstone yesterday, and it was fantastic. Not only is it one of the best westerns ever made (historians claim Val Kilmer was the most complete embodiment of the real Doc Holliday), the blu-ray was so crisp and beautiful I felt like I was there at the OK Corral when it all went down. What a great screenplay, too! I can quote this movie all day long!A must see, and a great addition to any blu-ray collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A breakdown of true history!","review":"Man, this is an awesome movie for the Boomers as well as the X's!

Corral gunfight. It's highly visually accurate, western buffs will spot a lot of attention to detail. The movie manages to capture the extraordinary circumstances of Wyatt Earp while not mythologizing him. There are top notch performances by all the major players, Val Kilmer may even partially steal the movie as 'Doc' Holliday. Although the movie greatly telescopes time you still retain the sense of the steadily building tensions which led to the famous confrontation. Of all the OK Corral movies this is the only one where the two main actors are close to the ages of Earp and Holliday and the only one where Doc Holliday's Southern manner and background are displayed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!","review":"I'm not a fan of westerns at all, I've never liked them. However, \\"Tombstone\\" is one of my favorite movies. I can't even begin to comment on the excellent performance that Val Kilmer gives, it's almost too perfect.

It's excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tombstone on DVD","review":"Don't get the wrong idea about that 2 star rating -- we LOVED the movie, have worn out two VHS copies.

Will NOT be purchasing it now as not particularly interested in all the trailers, interviews, map, etc. Can only hope now for a Special Edition release.

Once they have retired, they settle into a town where the red sashed mobsters rule. As the movie progresses, the mobsters provoke Earp & co. to the point of coming out of retirement.This movie features the famous shootout at the OK Corral, but goes far beyond that in the lives of these law men.Before seeing this movie, I heard it was an incredible movie. Maybe I just came into it with expectations that were too high, so I would warn anyone that if they have not seen Tombstone before that they not keep their expectations too high. Otherwise, you may be as disappointed as I was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wyatt Earp is MUCH better than Tombstone!","review":"I usually HATE westerns, but while having another of my insomniac attacks, I ended up watching Wyatt Earp with Kevin Costner and Dennis Quaid, etc. I don't EVEN like Kevin Costner, but LOVED this movie and have watched it several times since!Being interested, now, in the life of Mr. Earp, my husband and I rented Tombstone. What a disappointment!!!!! I love Kurt Russell, but was sooooooo disappointed in his characterization of Wyatt Earp. He seemed like such a coward, always wanting to run to get away from the \\"bad guys\\"! WHAT?!?!? Totally different portrait than anything I've ever heard or read of the REAL Wyatt Earp.Now, again, Val Kilmer did an excellent job portraying Doc Holliday! \\"I'll be your Huckelberry!\\" Too funny!

Still, this is a great singer giving us wonderful performances of excellent songs.

Needless to say I'm disappointed and wouldn't ever buy another product from them. I'm thinking my dad would have liked it being a smoker much of his life and salting everything within reach because his taste buds had been 'fried'. I'd give this product a low rating also because the \\"other spices\\" could include anything. I'll be more discriminating next time.

For such a character she makes incredibly stupid choices, and exhibits both self defeating and immature behavior throughout. Other characters were not well enough developed or sympathetic enough for me to really care about them. Near the end of the book (no spoiler here) the NYPD and the FBI have to locate someone, and the complete idiocy ad ineptitude in their overlooking several obvious ways to do this almost instantly is unbelievable. It is also actually insulting that the author expects us to go along with one of the most contrived and nonsensical endings I have ever read. I have read other books by Kelman and liked them.

It had an inscription on the very front page. The [...] mentioned that it was \\"new, never read but name written inside front cover\\". What am I supposed to do now!!! I will have to cut the page out to give it as a gift. I don't think I will ever order from Amazon again. The first seller suggested I return it for another.

Big Mistake. KitchenAid quality control must have been absent when this behemoth went down the assembly line. Even white bread set at the highest number on the temperature setting does not brown and it takes LONGER to NOT do it. Frozen waffles? Forget it.

I assume Mr. Coverdale didn't have much to do with this so I won't blame him. EMI needs to step up to the plate and re-release \\"Trouble\\" with bonus live tracks or how about a bonus DVD. Fans of the old Whitesnake will snag in a heartbeat. Also, there is not one official DVD from Whitesnake.

They do move the story along quite nicely. Others have mentioned Austin and Wodehouse as possible inspirations for Caudwell. The red herrings abound and one must be prepared to suspend all disbelief and simply enjoy the journey. The character of Isabella who allows a vulture and twelve ravens total access to her drawing room reminds me more than a bit of many Monty Python skits. Prepare for the unexpected and unbelievable and you will find it in this novel.

In \\"A Deadly Secret\\" author Matt Birkbeck carves a gripping narrative that takes us deep into the psyche of Robert Durst and the events surround the disappearance of his wife Kathie and the murders of Morris Black and Susan Berman. Along the way he shows us the stark reality of the ugly politics behind such a high profile investigation and the equally repulsive actions of a supposed friend of Kathie Durst.It's investigative journalism at its best..hard hitting, interesting, and dead on believable. Birkbeck has written for the Philadelphia Inquirer and Reader's DIgest, and his work is gutsy. This book has served as a guidline for investigators, and is a must for any true crime collection, or any book collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"So strange, so good","review":"What I enjoyed most about his book was how the story flowed, and how the author turned a true story into a very enjoyable novel.What's truly remarkable about this book, aside from the strange and chilling story, is the characters, and how the author manages to weave them in and out of the narrative. It works to perfection, leaving the reader with strong emotions towards the major figures in this case. The authors ability to get behind the scenes, including his use of the actual police files from 1982, gives us delicious new details about Durst and the case, and leads us up to the murders of Susan Berman in 2000 and Morris Black in 2001. Add in the political machinations, particulary the questionable-at-best actions of the Westchester, NY district attorney, and you have one heck of a story. The Durst trial for the Black murder is next spring, and anyone even remotely interested in this case must read this thoroughly engrossing book."},{"rating":"2","title":"What surprises!","review":"A really good read that left me wanting for more.

This book is supposedly written by a journalist, but Birkbeck is more of an opinionated boor, in my opinion. His continual comments upon the character of everyone associated with this unsolved case is more than annoying, it is cloying and leads me to believe he must have a stake in this case in some sick way. Is he obsessed with or in love with the detective (Becerra, or whatever his name is -- I don't have the book in front of me; it's in the trash)? This is an unsolved case. Many law enforcement people have worked many long hard hours on the case, but in the author's opinion there is only one of them who \\"really cares\\" .... Give me a break!

Unfortunately, this edition of LP China disappoints. I like the logistical information (I give an extra star for that), but I am really dismayed at the emphasis given to popular spots, \\"backpacker meccas\\", places \\"beloved by backpackers\\", \\"a good place to 'kick back'\\", etc. It even goes as far as to show contempt for people looking for the \\"'real China'\\". I think I will look for another title, and if there is not a better one out there then I will write my own. As LP is alienating their core market here, maybe a new opportunity opens for new writers..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did the authors actually go?","review":"I used this book only in Beijing and Shanghai, so I can only vouch for those two sections. The maps of Beijing were great, when they were there. Because the book appears not to have been copy edited, there are lots of references to more detailed maps there are not actually in the book.Also, the Beijing section doesn't include some of the most interesting areas for tourists to visit. It seems like someone just did a google search on Beijing and listed the first few things that come up, regardless of their interest or relevance to tourists. A major park walking distance to the forbidden city surrounded by cafes, museums and excellent souvenir shops is simply not listed.Shanghai was a little better.It is a good book for dreaming though. I am keeping my copy so I can plan ahead for next trip. Before I actually go though I will be buying a different book."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy this book","review":"Admittedly there are not many other China guidebooks around, but this one seriously sucked. I bought one at my local bookstore for a recent trip to China and (i) the attitude of the editors is simply disgusting [If they can't appreciate the country then they shouldn't even bother to write a book about it] (ii) too much of the info is extremely outdated. We all know that China is growing rapidly and whatnot but that really is no excuse for Lonely Planet to not do their homework and give us horrendously erronous info (iii) Any 'off-the-beaten-track' sight featured in Lonely Planet books inevitably become tourist traps for obvious reasons. It's the last time I'm ever buying Lonely Planet books.

Guess what, there is NOTHING new in the 8th edition. The same errors from the 7th edition have been reproduced in full even though anyone who has spent more then a month in China in the last five years will know how laughably inaccurate the book is in places. It¡s still an OK guide but it¡s terribly out of date and it is not only misleading but dishonest for them to call this an 8th edition. It is nothing more then a rerun of a previous edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Crap","review":"This book is so bad. If I could give it 0 stars believe me, I would. Many of the things listed in this book no longer exist. I went to one city and all 4 places listed in the LP as budget accomodations were no longer in business. Maps were incorrect. Attractions were listed with one address and placed elsewhere (and incorrectly) on the map. It would help greatly of it had more Chinese of the locations listed so you can show cab drivers. I finally gave up, chucked it into the trash and continued my 4 month trip through Asia without consulting any guidebook and had a much nicer time. Down with the Lonely Liar!

Even got quoted $179 for some ridiculous contraption from an electrical trader.

Enough was enough. Got onto Amazon and discovered Mr LongArm. @ $15 plus postage and handling and I had it in 7 days.

(thank god i had the shower door closed - otherwise i would have been picking glass shards out of my shins) i guess I could take a lamp shade frame and secure a net or pillowcase - then attach it to the base of the suction cup- to catch the bulbs next time... or possibly put a glue dot in the suction cup for taking the burned out bulb down...i gave this product 1 star because that's the minimum, and an extra star because i did change a few light bulbs with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does NOT work.","review":"The suction cups do not engage the bulb.

The additional analysis seems weak, and is often little more than restatements of obvious points. Some of the history is glossed over, while some random and extraneous facts are given, without much reason that I could find. Maps are helpful but often don't have all the geographic landmarks that are mentioned in the text, which limits their usefulness.

Its made of sturdy plastic.It did not come with formal directions, they are just on the box.

The box says that there is a mechanism that randomly select the slot out of all the slots which will probably make it fun but it is useless when everyone knows the answer.

Now I'm weighing in on the side of those who found that the product does not work. The first four or five times we played, the pirate popped up repeatedly and it was quite fun. But then, it just stopped popping up, except with one slot. So, you put sword after sword after sword and nothing happens. It's incredibly boring, both for myself and for my three year old. The product is really cheaply made and definitely not worth the $10 plus $5 s/h that I paid for it. We decorated the barrel with some ocean stickers we had lying around and counted the different colored swords for a while and then just threw it all in the trash. I strongly do not recommend this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Nana","review":"I recently purchased this toy for my grandson's birthday.

There is no reading involved and it goes by pretty quickly so you don't have to much whining in between turns. It is really funny to watch our kids (ages 5 and 9 months) scream in glee as the pirate pops out of his barrel. Set up is a breeze. The only problem we had is that one time we played and the pirate never popped out, even though all the swords were in place. We found out that someone didn't puch the sword in all the way, this would be something you would just have to make sure was done during wach turn. Other than that, this is a cool game and takes a pretty good beating with out breaking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun for really little ones","review":"It's been a couple years since we owned this toy but I thought it was worth mentioning what I know about it. When we had this toy we had two boys 5 and 4. They loved to play the game and used it quite a bit for a couple months. But after awhile they figured out which spot would make the pirate jump up and then it lost all use. So depending on how observant your kids are you might have limited play time. I do kinda wish I still had it because now I have a new set of little ones that would enjoy it...but I wouldn't buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make sure you TURN the pirate when it's loaded to make it random!!","review":"This is a fun game for little ones, but it took me a little while to figure out how to make it random. When you load the pirate (without any swords in the barrel), you need to push down on the pirate lightly and then twist him around a few times. This moves the mechanism so each time it's different. Maybe I lost the instructions, but it certainly doesn't say this on the box! Initially, it was the same slot every time and I thought it was broken!Rather than losing when the pirate pops up, my kids like it when they win. It sort of makes it more exciting for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have chosen something different","review":"It did not work with my little one, he prefers to play with something different.I think that it has so many little swords to put in that it takes a while to see the pirate pop ....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work, even when new","review":"We just received this as a gift, and fresh out of the box, it was broken. The pirate part is loose, so it doesn't sink down into the barrel enough to let it pop out, like it's supposed to. I tried pushing hard, twisting it, but nothing worked. Based on the other reviews, it doesn't seem like it would have been that fun even if it had worked.

Hydra opens with three superb tunes (Hydra, St George and the Dragon, 99) and then, on track 5, dives into possibly Toto's worst song committed to disc (All Us Boys) which sounds like a Kenny Loggins discard.The rest of the album can't quite sustain the momentum of the openers but Mama has aged gracefully with a measured Bobby Kimball lead vocal and funky jazz rhythm track. St George and the Dragon shows a songwriter (David Paich) in rare form. A song with many textures and hooks - one of Toto's best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melancholy in Toto","review":"Yes I prefer even KOD to this- why? there is a subdued, slightly negative Sunday evening feel to this album. Don't get me wrong, the playing is top-notch like any other TOTO creation.Hydra live sounds great, but here is sort of melancholy..All us boys is pure Lukather fun, and it feels like it belong to TOTO I rather than Hydra. Even the hard rocking moments like White Sister have a dark feel...don't know, I'd rather listen to Turn Back I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"For hardcore Toto fans only","review":"This is certainly not a bad album but I think only the Toto faithful (myself included) would care anything about it. Another reviewer comments on the \\"dark and edgy\\" nature of \\"Hydra\\" and it could definitely fall into that category. The only problem is that I don't really like my Toto \\"dark and edgy\\" unless you consider their 1992 release \\"Kingdom of Desire\\" (arguably their best) a little dark. The best tracks here are \\"Hydra\\", \\"Lorraine\\", and \\"White Sister\\". Enjoy whats here but don't fail to check out other superior Toto albums including the afformentioned \\"Kingdom of Desire\\", \\"Turn Back\\", and the outstanding \\"Mindfields\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music for the D&D crown","review":"Toto is one of those groups that you didn't admit liking in the 80's. Hydra is the Toto album you didn't admit owning. Dungeons & Dragons freaks will no doubt enjoy the references to dragon slaying. The rest of us loved Steve Lukather's catchy guitar hooks.

With this book I'm learning vocabulary at my own pace and in a way that's easy and entertaining. I like to write down words and post them around my apartment (\\"los vasos\\" in my cabinet next to my glasses; \\"jugo de naranja\\" on my orange juice) so that as I'm brushing my teeth, or fixing dinner, or just getting dressed, I'm still reading and learning. I don't think I'd recommend this book on its own, but combined with Magic Key it's a great way to learn Spanish, and it's small and lightweight enough to keep in my purse and take with me wherever I go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for a beginner/traveler","review":"This book was written by the same woman who wrote \\"Magic Key to Spanish\\". I read this one first and knew Magic Key had to be really good. This book (See it & Say it) focuses on vocabulary and simple sentences, which is nice because at the start, you don't want to be presented with anything too complex, or too much stuff. I'd say if you want to travel to a Spanish-speaking country or something, get this book. If you are really serious about learning a lot of the Spanish language, Magic Key is where you should start (or read both books) Margarita Madrigal is great at presenting information! If you want some excellent review for grammar specifically, check out Dorothy Richmond's books: her Spanish Verb Tenses book and Pronouns and Prepositions book are awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"a handly little book excellent for quick review/study.","review":"This book could be used by both beginner and intermediate, as well as advanced. like most books it starts simple and builds in complexity. It offers pictures along with targeted word. Another very good spanish book by Margarita Madrigal, would be, Madrigal's magic key to spanish which builds a good guide into understanding all parts of spanish so one can see the complete operatings of the language. \\"Say it in Spanish\\" is less description and more vocab building then the previously mentioned. Both are good books and neither will be disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for adult ed class","review":"We have been using this book in our adult ed Spanish class for a number of years now.

The choice of some of the war-horses of American music makes for a rather dynamic musical moment. Actually the choice is dynamic enough that it could probably be played in your car stereo and come through quite alright. A thought if you ever want to fight back in traffic, with class. The interpretations are good, in particular an inspired Appalachian Spring. Unfortunately, and this is why I give it only 4 stars, the Rhapsody in Blue is not as inspired. Certainly it is good, but perhaps because we have heard it so much, I did not find it bringing something new to the listener. However, this is a nice record to have, if anything for the Copland works, and for a good Jill Gomez, showing us that Barber's \\"Knoxville: Summer of 1915\\" is becoming deservedly more popular."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glue It Into Your Car CD Player","review":"I am serious.

The intro to \\"so many tears\\" was poorly dubbed, and looked to fade in and out, and so did \\"When my homiez call\\". I guess if you are an advid Tupac fan, this is an all right purchase, but if you want higher quality videos, and rarer footage, pick up Death Rows DVD, its much better quality, and has a lot of Tupac footage"},{"rating":"2","title":"A decent compilation that could have had a little bit more..","review":"There are 12 tracks on this music video compilation of some of Tupac's greatest hits, including California Love, How Do You Want It?, To Live and Die in LA, and 2 of America'z Most Wanted. This collection is very inexpensive and a must buy for any 2Pac or rap fan. Unfortunately, the DVD is only single layer/single sided. I only wish they had put more material on the disc, as 2Pac had one of the most prolific and successful careers of any rap artist in such a short amount of time.

For this reason the DVD's title is inaccurate because not all of Tupac's best material was present. This may be explained by the fact it was produced by a New York production company. However there are good videos with some dope intro's to the songs like in 2 of Amerikaz most wanted. Overall it is a good buy because Tupac simply always means good value 4 money.

It is worse than I ever could think of. The sound is very bad with lot of noize and the picture quality is also very bad. I think it is not original because when tupac says something like motherf*** then you will hear like for exemple when you listen to MTV another word instead.

At a regular doctor visit six months into her pregnancy Q learns that in order to save her babys life, she must get total bed rest until delivery time.Written in journal entry form we spend three months at home with Q as she tries to reconnect with her work obsessed husband, mend relationships with her mother and sisters, help the neighbors fight a legal battle, and play confidante to a friend who is having an affair with a married man.By the end of the story, Q has her baby but life will never be the same after spending 3 months on Bed Rest.Sarah Bilston has put out a wonderful debut novel about motherhood, marriage, and bed rest and is currently working on another book titled Sleepless Nights. I sure hope it follows up with Q and Tom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Read","review":"Quinn is placed on bed rest for her last trimester. Her days on the couch are broken up by visits from friends and relatives, increasing tension with her workaholic husband, and her involvement in helping a tenants' group that is being wrongly evicted by a real estate corporation which is curiously enough, represented by her husband's law firm. Will Quinn and her husband get through a rocky spot in her marriage? Will her visiting mother drive her over the edge? Will Quinn manage to help the tenants? And most importantly, will the baby be ok? Bilston does an excellent job of portraying the dull days of a pregnancy on bed rest. The other plot lines are interesting, but somehow not compelling.

I mean what editor today would manage a straight face upon opening a proposal about a middle-aged gay man taking care of the irrepressible dog of his working-class lover who's in jail? But as usual, with any work of art -- craft, talent, intelligence, compassion -- this remarkable work is so much more than that. Around its droll premise, Ackerley found a way to brilliantly expose the pettiness of people, regardless (or precisely because) of their social standing. The dog, which is just as vividly alive as each of this novel's (bipedal) characters, is really only it's lovable catalyst.

Not necessarily so, here. Although this collection contains some decent standouts from the Harry J All Stars et. al, most of the material borders on kitsch and comes off as somewhat dispensable within just the first listen, unlike much of the instrumental/dub work of Lee Scratch/Upsetters.

If you were a fan of Billy Squier as I was, you already knew that Alan had talent. I believe I developed a love of the piano/keys in the rock genre while listening to Billy's songs. It is also quite evident why Alan was the perfect choice to sing backing vocals for Billy. Which is not to say that he is strictly a background singer. This CD proves once and for all that he has the talent and the chops to carry any lead vocal. His own vocal arrangements, especially on Fire Island is a real treat.Love is the Word, Kick, Bitch Called Jealousy & Fire Island are catchy tunes that started me singing along quickly. It's a nice, feel good CD.I hope that this is not the last we hear from him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best Guide for Travelers","review":"I've read and used both this book and Moon's Costa Rica Handbook.

However, I have noticed that they seem to have lost some of their spark and have become more mainstream and institutionalized in recent years.For those planning an extensive trip to Costa Rica, I would suggest buying both Moon and Lonely Planet guides as each provides information and insights the other lacks.

It reminds me of a WWII movie you would see in the 1960's but a little more fact based and there is no slowdown in the story with romance. The acting was good as was the action scenes but there are never enough action scenes for me. There were a few small issues with some of the uniforms and equipment for the historian types but nothing blatant, I watch these types for movies for the story not what type of holster or sling the characters use. If you liked \\" Where Eagles Dare\\" you would probably like this movie. Keep in mind that the good guys prevail but they pay a heavy price and not all of them make it back like they did in the 1960's movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Age of Reruns","review":"This is advertised as one of the first of the commando raids by a new British undercover team going up against a crack SS Alpine unit. But in the film, the only thing these Germans are good at shooting at is the local civilian population. When they have to go up against the British Commandos it's a turkey shoot with the SS dropping like flies. It reminded me of the the old Combat series where Sarge and Hanley mowed down wave after wave of hapless Germans. It was cliche filled as one other reviewer mentioned and you may have deja vu when you watch it, thinking you have seen it before. The first part of the movie is your standard in training drills with a Scottish version of Lee Emery showing the potential commando recruits the ropes. There was just nothing new here. I was going to give a star and a half for the uniforms, but you can't do half star's.

The title song, \\"The Last Song\\", shows Lynda's adept ability to sing a slow and haunting melody.

The performances those two turned in at least warrant a mention, i think, so there it is. Okay, so far this has been more rave than review, but here it goes... This movie was a brilliant and sparkling portrayal of Hardy's classic. The scenes, especially those between Angel and Tess are played in a vein Hardy would have been proud of, and although i agree Jason Flemyng makes Alec rather too likeable all other changes and/or ommissions in the plot never detract from the enjoyability of the story.

She has the perfect beauty and the perfect tone and spirit to do justice to one of the great heroine's of English literature. The viewer becomes more and more attached to brave Tess as the tragic story progresses. This is a gripping romantic tragedy, but not for those who require sunshine and a happy ending. The closing scene is one of the saddest, yet most beautiful, in all period cinema.

The scenery is breathtaking, the acting fabulous.So if I liked this movie so much, why give it only 2 stars? Because while I loved how the movie looked and felt, I really disliked the actual story. A commentary on society from the obviously troubled author Hardy, this story is very dark and depressing. Poor Tess never had a chance against her circumstances - the ending is no surprise.So I have to say - if you liked the book or enjoy Hardy anyway, watch this - if you only want to watch another great BBC film - watch Pride and Prejudice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Stunning Tearjerker","review":"Like the equally magnificent Mayor of Casterbridge, A&E; has done another wonderful job with this immensely entertaining adaption of Thomas Hardy's Tess of the D'Urbervilles.Everything from the casting to the sets to the acting is superb, and Justine Waddell truly shines as Tess. Not only is she breathtakingly beautiful in the role, but she conveys Tess's spirit and pluck as few other actresses could. Jason Flemyng as Alec D'Urberville is also a standout, and plays the role with a devilish charm that is irresistible. The rest of the cast is likewise great.The movie, at a running time of about three hours, moves along at a fast pace; anyone will most likely watch all of it in one sitting.Although the ending is depressing (as most of Hardy's novels are), the film is truly a treat that you won't want to miss out on.Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than Polanski's version","review":"At least it's more amusing.In Polanski's version, when Tess rides with Alec to The Slopes, I don't really know why Tess gets angry. But in this version, I get it, bcoz it shows how Alec rides the carriage recklessly. Sorry, Tess, but I found it was too amusing.:P Also, the whistling lesson from Alec is quite interesting too.And this version is much more faithful to the novel. It shows the conversion of Alec from a dandy to a preacher. Another amusing moment!:P Unlike Polanski's version, reintroducing Alec by stating that Tess' mother writes to him. If Tess' mother was willing to wrote Alec a letter after Angel abandoned Tess, why didn't she write to Alec when she knew Tess was pregnant? Polanski's Tess is quite unbelivable.Finally, the acting of Ms. Waddell is amazing! I really get bored by Polanski' Tess. I watched Polanski's version in class, but I slept and missed some parts, and I got this version later.This mini movie rocks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Superjoint","review":"I love all of Phl's stuff.

Complete with Achilles (Amyas Leigh), Patroclus (Frank Leigh), Helen (Rose), Paris (Guzman), and a Trojan War (The Defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588). The Odyssey too comes in, with the great wanderings in distant lands. Rather unexpectedly for a novelist of Kingsley's calibre and values, the book has transformed the Elizabethan English into a noble race of Godlike Heroes and the Spanish into villains far worse than the Trojans have ever been depicted as being. Jesuits are particularly maligned, and Indians are unfairly portrayed. This tends to dampen the reader's enthusiasm somewhat, as he/she realises that the author himself may be more remote in value system from our day and age than the characters he portrays. The one redeeming feature is the high tension it generates, but this is - probably consciously - influenced by the epics, as the author himself hints."},{"rating":"2","title":"Check out the open solo","review":"DC can really play. That is what this video should be called. For the life of me, I never will get it why in these drum instructional videos why the interviewer is always some geeky guy who asks benign questions. Please someone read this. Get a name drummer (Weckl, Gadd, anyone but what is on the video)in a different genre of music to interview the guy so they can ask questions that may be a little more, I don't know, interesting. His playing is fantastic. It is amazing to see him so fast on those big drums. This, like his other video, is not long for educational purposes but you will learn how he does what he does. Pulling it off at that speed, that's a different story. Good luck gentlemen. Definitely a must have for all drummers dvd collections. Sound and video work are excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nek Rocks","review":"I completely agree with guillermoj. This is an awesome album. Like he says, every song has a hook that immediately gets stuck in your head. Generally speaking I stay away from pop rock, but after I first heard this album I had to have it. Yes, Nek reminds you of Sting, but he also reminds you of Bono and there are some excellent guitar riffs that are very U-2ish, not a bad thing in my book. El Ano Cero is a stand out album, mostly because Nek's delivery is varied and multifaceted. Every song rocks. Every song is superbly well mixed and well arranged. The sound is chrystal clear. It's just plain good music and an extremely well engineered product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Easy!","review":"I've tried the book alone, book with tapes, tapes alone, NOT as easy as expected!

Well worth the rental and time to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good teacher/student guide","review":"I found that this is a good guide for teachers of poetry who desire to offer form poetry to students with little exposure to various forms. As one who has researched many forms, I was hoping to find unique forms within this book, which was not the case. It is a good foundational book for students and teachers, but for poets familiar with the more common forms and seeking to expand into new areas of poetic form, it is probably not the best of guides, which is why I have rated it a little lower."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Alphabetically lists the different poetic forms--you can flip through with ease. I love the simplicity of the book. Examples are given with each description. It's basic, easy to read and covers it all.

Those guys are NOT FANS!!!!Nemo! , its the first brand new single from NIGHTWISH , In this Single CD you get, Nemo - Radio Edit Version if Im not mistaken, Planet Hell - A song from the album, a duet between Tarja and Marcos ( kinda like Century Child's Dead To The World ) an amazing song with really bombastic choirs and orchestra, White Night Fantasy - This is a non- album track, this song its something 100% different , Tarja's voice its very weird on this song, they wanted to do something different , they did , But the results of this song isnt actually the greatest thing...... Nemo ( Orchestra Version )- its the orchestra version of NEMO , I really liked it , but the normal rock version its definetly BETTER!!! and last , you get the Studio Footage video!!!!!

I was blown away. Picked up this 4 track CD to check out more. The cross between Wagnerian style vocals, heavy metal guitar licks, and industrial like keyboards is awesome. I'm not sure I would even classify this as strictly heavy metal, though it has the pounding, kicking drive on Nemo and Planet Hell, it has musical qualities that take it a notch beyond. The cover of the CD said the full album was due out by now and I came looking for that. Because I need more. Great stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nemo - no, not the fish.","review":"You're probably wondering like I was whether Nemo Pt.1 (this is just the normal version as opposed to this limited edition)is better than this one. The answer is Pt.1. While this edition has a video, it's not a DVD video and you can just download the Nemo video for free from www.metalstorm.ee. The normal edition has more songs and 'White Night Fantasy' which is not on the 'Once' album. While Nemo is a terrific song, if you want the video, buy the DVD single or the normal Nemo single. There is also a video on the normal version which I find a bit more enjoyable than the Nemo video clip. The video is a collection of shots taken behind the scenes of Nemo and is played to 'White Night Fantasy'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music","review":"I hear this CD and it's great.

These scripts are incomplete and written in Perl4 so they don't take advantage of all that Perl5 has to offer. I have spent countless hours and hundreds of dollars hiring programmers to correct and finish this set of scripts for a client's web site.The book is interesting to read and you will learn some foundations of Perl programming (if you can get past the spelling, grammatical, and CODE typos). But the old adage applies here: You get what you pay for. There are better solutions for complete online commerce solutions. They just cost a bit more."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a book for first time Commerce setups....","review":"This book is based solely on the program that comes on CD-Rom with the book. So before you will understand what the book is talking about you have to install the files on your server. The book makes most of the installation part a huge guessing game. When you finally get it installed, check if it works. If your lucky you won't have to call your Hosting Service to have any little extra services turned on just to get the program running. Now that you have it WORKING right and you move on to the rest of the book, your stuck with a very unattractive web site. Help on customizing this cgi is another guessing game. All in all I say this book was very vage and really doesnt get down to the nitty gritty on web commerce. It's almost as if they are trying to get you to use thier program for some reason, which by the way is out dated and you'll have to download a newer version online."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect this book/software to work miracles.","review":"The book claimed that you could download the latest software from the website and that there is a windows version as well as the unix version available for download. After not being able to find the windows version for download I sent email to the author inquiring where I could find the windows version. I was then emailed back with a long email claiming that they were very busy and that if I wanted support I would have to pay $300.00!

Now when I go shopping with my wife, I look at the brands and I better appreciate what goes into marketing those brands and products.Admittedly, my aim in reading the book was to learn more about how to reinvent a brand, but the book does not really tell me how to do it in detailed steps.

It takes some getting used to Beveridge's style and the old examples can appear to be ancient at first, I found that in the end I could not put this book down. It offers a complete overview of all the steps involved in scientific discoveries (reason, chance, intuition and strategy) that still holds true for the 21st century.This is a great book for anyone starting in science and also for those who are going through a rough time when results are not coming along as smoothly as one might hope: it is a strong reminder that science really is an art!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cream","review":"I use this at night, as well as a retinal, alternating nights.

Huge problem when it's time to start a new roll of border in the middle of a wall. The 2nd and 3rd roll were about a 1/4 of an inch shorter than the first roll we put up. As I stated originally, the design is very cute and colorful but the problems with it failing to stay on the wall (which is somewhat of a necessity) and the uneven width made this purchase very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware - HFCS","review":"I went to their site where they say these cherries are sweetened with sugar.

It looked like a good fit, as it was always a chore to get to the good stuff when eating the things.The first cut is made with end that has a straight double-bladed cutter, that straddles the seam running from center to outside edge.Then you use the curved blade to cut along the outside edge of the thick skin following the curved shape of the grapefruit. You end up with nice little wedges of grapefruit, that are intact, with nearly all the juices.A great little tool that sees use every time there is a grapefruit to be eaten.

It took me going through a few grapefruit halves before I really got the hang of it, but now I'm a pro! This knife does its job perfectly, and exactly as advertised. I did not experience the issue some of the other reviewers have commented on about getting junk stuck between the blades. Yes, some of the meat would get between the blades, but it would just be pushed out when I cut around the next membrane. The only problem I had in using it was when seeds would get between the blades, and on the rare occasion of that happening, they could just be blown out easily.The only gripe I have about this knife is the lack of some kind of case. The blades on it are very sharp! I take this to the office with me every day, and I'm terrified of cutting myself or my car seats with it.

Unlike the previous reviewer, I am not giving this 2 stars. Nowadays no DVD should ever be released as Full Screen only if it's not the original aspect ratio. What a wasted opportunity to finally have a nice quality DVD of this film.

Way better than the other 6 films. From start to finish this movie takes you on a ride. The bingo scene was great. And when the children chained the door in the church meeting. That was a unforgettable scene. Christie Clark was very hot in that movie as well. This was very close to being the best horror film of the 1990's."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best children-corn film since the first.","review":"When I first saw that they made another children of the corn film,I just said it's going to be a repeat of the first. I was wrong. The movie was awsome and almost as better as the first. The cast of the movie,was wonderful. Even the girl who play lacy,now she look like a wonderful person to work with on the movie. Also my hat off to the director David price who did a good job with the final sacrifice,his work,and any ideas that he had on the film with the writers on the scenes were great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who's better than Micah??","review":"This is my absolute favorite out of all of the COTC movies (I'm not even going to bother to count IV, which had nothing to do with the others, and didn't even mention He Who Walks Behind The Rows). The continuity from the first to this one was great and the kids were the last great group. Of course, the story isn't 100% coherent and there are a couple of questions I have such as: So, did the corn really cause some sort of delusions? I don't think so but you never know. What the heck was with the ending with Redbear dressed as a wise man and all? Was Micah HWWBTR, was he possessed by a part of HWWBTR, or was he just controlled by him? Ah, well. Anyway, despite my questions, Micah is my absolute favorite leader, and Mordechai is a good counterpart to the Malachai character in the first one. Damn those Outlanders, why do they always have to get involved!! Micah could've gone all the way!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was in this movie","review":"I'm only writing a review because I was actually in this movie. It was a bit part with only two lines -- and they were both cut from the final film -- but as least you can see me in some scenes. I played Deputy Palmer, who is seen talking to and holding back various extras during the 2nd scene in the movie, where the police and others have gathered outside a building after the discovery of bodies in the basement. This was supposed to be the beginning of my film 'career,' but when a different talent agency did the casting for Hellraiser 3 I couldn't find any more work. Plus, I became a single parent and had to spend all my time caring for my daughter. Oh well. Overall, the movie was lousy, but I had fun during my two days on the set."},{"rating":"1","title":"A REALLY \\"CORNY\\" MOVIE","review":"They say that this sequel surpassed it's original. From watching this movie that aint achieving much! All the kids talk about is the \\"corn\\". They only good things about the movie are Lacy and Angela. they are damn HOT! One of them even has a sex scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than The First Children Of The Corn!","review":"I was not a fan of the original 80's Children of the Corn, so I had reservations about purchasing this. I'm glad I did purchase it though, because it's a lot better than the first. It's still not great, but it has style, good gore, and some laughs courtesy of a couple of old ladies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finished up","review":"I watched all of the COTC movies except this one. I looked all over for this movie but could not find it on DVD only to find out it's not on DVD or on Netflix."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks","review":"This movie sucks so bad. The deaths were terrible (as in boring). The moving mound in CCOTC1 returns but you still dont see what the monster looks like!!!!! Most of the kids die at the end due to weopon backfiring, the music is five star, i would recomend the soundtrack. Save your money, dont by this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie ROCKS!","review":"Reporter and his step son go to Gatlin to investigate the goings on of part 1 when what should happen but another kid goes crazy and turns the townschildren against their parents. Forget the first one even existed, this packs great special effects, great acting and it's even a little scary. Popcorn, Pepsi and Pizza."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought the film was brilliant","review":"I loved this film as it was brilliant. It shows how a child can lead all these children into becoming murderers of the Adult race. It also had a lot of blood and gore and that is the type of film I like - Horror. My fave type is Stephen King which the film is based on his book. Children of The Corn II : The final sacrifice is definitly worth watching if you are a horror fan like myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"THEY'RE BACK!","review":"The children are back with a new leader after the massacre in Gatlin.

Very little also about his humble beginnings in showbussiness,before the radio show and the signature with CAPITOL records.One of the best moment has DEAN missing a lyric while singing BLUE MOON.So ,this is a pleasant affair,but if you are looking for a complete biography ,you are bound to be disapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Try Not To Smile While You're Watching This DVD","review":"This DVD is pure gold. A must for any Dean fan. You will be smiling from ear to ear. Not only does this bring back fond memories of his celebrated TV show, but it also provides music that is not available anywhere on CD. The medley with Peggy Lee is priceless and worth the price of admission alone. The duet with Petula Clark is also thoroughly enjoyable. Aside from the great music on this DVD, Dean's charm and personality abound. From his ability to not take himself seriously to his ability to sing a ballad effortlessly, makes you see what a talent Dean really was. I only wish there was more Dino reissues available on CD. The picking is slim so get what you can. Especially when the these songs are gems that are for the most part unavailable elsewhere. So go out and get this video because it will put a smile on your face. And when you're smiling the whole world smiles at you."},{"rating":"2","title":"That's Amore'","review":"If Dean Martin's voice isn't enough for your memories, watch this DVD, oooooooooh \\"Memories are Made of This\\". I was in my preteens when I would watch my mother swoon over this man as we sat in the livingroom on Thursday evenings. Oh the simple days. I purchased this DVD to bring back those memories of the simple, fun, carefree lifestyle. Unlike today which is now so polictically correct. Greg Garrison explains the various ways Dean comes down the staircase to the special friendship they had. My special highlight is when Dean is singing Moon River makes the mistake in the lyrics.I enjoy this DVD so much and will continue to add such to my future COPA room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Bebel of today...","review":"Due to this CD's import status, no retailer I found listed any information on the title. If you are familiar with the Bebel of today (of Towa Tei and Brasil 2 Mil fame), wait until Six Degrees Records releases her solo album in early 2000. Geraldo Pereira plays like bossa nova on Sesame Street, and I don't recommend it -- not even for the camp value."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very mediocre bossa nova album","review":"I agree with Katie's review. I purchased this CD after hearing Bebel's excellent contributions to the \\"Next Stop Wonderland\\" soundtrack and \\"Brazil 2 Mil\\", and was very disappointed. I can't wait until her new album comes out though! While this CD is not terrible, I haven't had the urge to listen to it more than once or twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost complete","review":"I started listening to Churchill as a school boy from my father's recording of the 10\\" vinyl disk inserted in the Life Magazine two volume WWII of forty years past. Oddly, this series has many times the volume of that little record, but fails to contain all that record had. So it looses one star.Otherwise, the sound ranges from acceptable to good. And at a good price to boot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not live up to my expectations","review":"I ordered the dvd because I really liked Maggie Smith in Harry Potter, but really did not enjoy any of themovies on this dvd.

The Talking Heads (Bed Among the Lentils) monologues performance is both subtle and illuminating- a real landmark performance. The Millionairess is a thrilling bit of acting. And the remake of Suddenly Last Summer is quite an interesting counterpart to the famous Hepburn/Taylor film of the late 1950s. What I'd love to see is another set including TV films \\"Memento Mori\\" and others from her work on UK television. But this is a good start. Thank you BCC for releasing this in the USA! More please!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smith is Smith - a legend.","review":"To many people, Maggie Smith is a legend as a consummate actress. I am one of these people. Accordingly, I admit to possible bias. Nevertheless.....Her work in these separate stories, is first rate. Importantly, it shows her at her best in many disparate roles. Because of this, it is possible that one - or other - of the roles might be found less to the viewer's taste than another. In my opinion, this doesn't make Smith's acting any the less brilliant and convincing.A very good buy for, both, acting aficionados and Maggie Smith devotees."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Have for Any Maggie Smith Fan.","review":"I bought this set because this is the only DVD recording of \\"Talking Heads: Bed Among The Lentils\\" which is the most wonderful, touching monologue which was especially written by Alan Bennett for Maggie Smith. See it and love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dragon Tattoo and Rose mix well","review":"This is an interview only Charlie Rose could do. Unfortunately the author is no longer available.

Store for under $50.00 plus 7.25 % sales Tax. I am impressed with the value of this Karaoke Machine and its quality. As for the Microphone sound being low. This is common on almost all Karaoke Machines. The reason being is so that you don't get Feedback from the Units Speaker. I also have another Karaoke Machine and it's microphones work the same way as this Units. Also my Family has a Professional Karaoke Machine that cost well over $2000.00 it also has to have the mic volume turned up in order for your voice to be heard... But as far as this Machine goes its aces in my Book. I would recommend it anyday. Hope this information helps someone pick a good machine for a great price.PS: If this Unit is attached to a good Stereo Reciever the sound is 100 times better and the mic doesn't have to be turned way up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Karaoke Huh? What did you say?","review":"Wish I had read some of these reviews. Just purchased this machine from Target on sale for $59.99 (very surprised it is priced so high on Amazon). Anyway, got it home and the microphone doesn't work at all in either Mic 1 or Mic 2. A good friend of mine purchased one of these as well and they had to turn the volume up all the way in order to hear their voices over the music. She took hers back and got a Karaoke machine by Memorex.Can't recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Screen went belly-up quickly","review":"I bought this for my (then) 7-year-old for Christmas last year. She loves to sing and I thought this would be a great & fun way to improve her reading. The machine was fun while it lasted, but within about 6 months the monitor stopped working. Shortly after that, both plastic brackets that hold the microphones were broken off (first one, then the other). Disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect gift for a teen girl!","review":"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter. It was a hit with the entire family. The microphone volume could be a little louder, but once we ran the sound through our stereo system it was fine. The built in TV makes it perfect for her to use in her room, or when we entertain she can bring it down and hook it up to the entertainment system. Great gift and we are all happy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Product","review":"After 2 months the microphone wires just came out.

It's great that she can have it in her room and it doesn't need to be hooked up to the TV!!! Screen is just fine (I was worried it would be too small) sound is good. The only thing I would change is that you have to hold the microphone very close to your mouth- but she doesn't seem to mind. She can sing with her regular CDs- and doesn't mind that the lyrics don't come up- Definitely a fun one- hopefully it won't break!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Doesn't Work!","review":"The microphone sound on this machine did not work for me. The mic was only audible when the mic volume was all the way up, and the master volume was also very high. But with the master volume so high, the music was so loud that it drowned out the mic, and it was just too loud in general. I tested the mic in my stereo and it worked fine, so something was wrong with the machine. I called the Singing Machine customer service and I was told that this is a common complaint with this model, and that they did not think that my machine was any different from any other model 500. I asked if they got similar complaints with any other model, so that I would know which one to exchange this for, and they said this is the only one that seems to have this defect! I returned mine to Target, and plan to try another model. Do NOT buy this machine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"My daughter received this machine for her 8th birthday and was thrilled when she opened it. We were extremely disappointed however when she tried it out and with the volume all the way up you could hardly hear her voice.

But as of 2006, REV technology appears obsolete. Why? The speed. Write speeds are frustratingly slow, and read speeds aren't impressive, either.Today, the new USB portable hard drives from Seagate (100GB portable drive) and Western Digital (80GB) are a much better option. Yes, they're a bit more cost in terms of dollars per GB, but unless your time has absolutely no value, you'll make up the cost difference in time savings when reading or writing files. Plus, remember that with the REV drive, you have to spend $350 or so up front just for the drive alone. The 35GB cartridges must be purchased separately at additional cost. (At well over $1 per GB, by the way.)Bottom line: REV was ahead of its time for about 18 months. But today, due to speed problems and size limitations, the current 35GB REV technology is obsolete.

Iomega has finally delivered what they promised (and NEVER delivered at 2.0 USB!!!) with the Peerless several years ago. This unit is really small -- the disks are smaller than Zip disks -- and if they keep up with their plans of doubling the capacity every 18 months or so, they may really be onto something.

In fact, there is only one problem I have with this film- I wish it was more like the book. The thing is, this film was SERIOUSLY toned down for a teenage audience. But the thing is, this film would end up seen anwyway by this audience if it had an R rating, with all of the content from the book.I love this movie though. It could have been better, but it is a masterpeice already. Sort of.

This Pulitzer-prize winning columnist meets the director of \\"Men In Black\\" and TV's The Tick.Sonnenfeld's touch and a good soundtrack contribute to this madcap misadventure where a hallucinogenic toad, a sub-compact car, and a 'garbage disposal' bomb make for an outrageous race to save a corporate embezzler's step-daughter.An immaculate cast certifies the action will be riveting and breath-taking viewing after viewing.

There are many \\"main characters\\" in this movie and while Tim Allen might have been the biggest name in the film, I found the two dumb criminals (Johnny Knoxville and Tim Sizemore) along with Dennis Farina, a hit man, stole the show. The criminals really do act some lines well. Some jokes however were so bad I almost wanted to stop the movie, but rest assured, it gets better as it progresses. I'll leave the plot summary to the editorial review, but overall I'd say if you want to rent a few movies over a weekend or something, this isn't a bad choice, but if you're looking to buy a comedy, go a different direction. (I didn't watch the special features on the DVD but there weren't many.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for it to Come Out on Cable","review":"This film could have been much better given the material (I have read the book and it was hilarious). I think given a better script Mr. Sonnenfield could have made a much funnier movie. There are some great performances in this film-particularly Stanley Tucci, Dennis Farina (anyone remember Ray Bones?), and Heavy D and Omar Epps as two smooth and cool FBI agents. However, I do not understand the casting of Tim Allen. I will admit I have never been a fan of his, but his performance is terribly flat in this movie. And there is never really chemistry between him and Rene Russo. Overall I would say Big Trouble is an average movie that could have been great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unpsetting.","review":"\\"Big Trouble\\" was a big let down. I expected a really funny movie.

I wonder why Jason Lee took that role. Becuase he is allways funny in movies and in this movie his chactor was not funny buy I don't blame him I mean it's not his falut because the script was written every badly. Tim Allen, I hate to say it but he is washed up. Now of his live-action movies have I liked. Renne Russo has had two straight duds (the other \\"Showtime). Omara Eeps who is a good actor, he can't do comedy. Johnny Knockville was not funny like on \\"Jackass\\". Hevy D go back to the rap game.

That's the potential, but this movie feels like it never gets off the ground because there are so many subplots that detract from where the plot actually takes the characters(all of them) at the end that it feels subverted and half baked. It makes the audience wonder why this wasn't made into a television series instead(at least in this incarnation). It is funny at times and heartwarming as well, but you know what's wrong with it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time","review":"My advice is to not waste your time with this movie. It was just downright stupid and wasn't funny in my opinion. You'd think with Tim Allen, Rene Russo, and several other very good actors and actresses that it would be a great movie.

I was disappointed! The book is a pretty tired love story placed in loosely in the historical setting of how the Taj Mahal was built. I was surprised by how one dimensional all the characters were. Plus, not only was the historical context flawed and unrealistic, but the story itself just plodded along uninterestingly, until the inevitable conclusion. I read this for a book club, and otherwise doubt I would have finished it.

It was the best story we had read all year. We spoke with the author during our meeting and talked about his experience in Japan as a teacher, his motivation for the story line and his research into the real characters in this love story of persistence and courage.

Every word, setting, and time in history is shown so that you can actually feel a trace of how the Mughals lived. This book is a story of how love has lasted for so long alongside violence and evil. Even with all of the emotions, you are still amazingly satisfied. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys historical fiction. The title, Beneath a Marble Sky, says it for itself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I love historical fiction, and I was really looking forward to exploring the building of the Taj Mahal and a study of India with a fictitious story as the vehicle. But I soon tired of the romance novel feel of this book and quit reading it about 125 pages into it--something I rarely do. After turning ahead and seeing only more of the same, there was no reason to go on. It was too boring. It had a shallow, superficial feel that was more like a comic book or novel for teens than a serious novel for adults. I had just finished Michener's classic, Caravans, and felt like I was traveling in Afghanistan in 1946. This one had none of that feel. I'll keep looking for something with some substance, depth, and character development about India--maybe Taj will be more satisfying.

The Princess Jahanara, eldest daughter of the Hindustani ruler Shah Jahan, tells the story in flashback form to her two granddaughters. The story is one of great loves, great treachery, and the building of one of the world's greatest monuments, the Taj Mahal. This was a wonderful story which made me want to learn more about the building of the Taj Mahal.After I finished the book, I did indeed check out another book about the building of the Taj Mahal. What I learned there was interesting too, and I was stunned by the beauty of this building. I did learn that \\"Beneath a Marble Sky\\" is only loosely based on the historical facts behind the building of this monument, but that didn't diminish my enjoyment of the story one bit!

I saw a small blurb in NewsWeek about how the author was willing to participate in a book club's discussion of his book (either in person or by conference call). Apparently, the book had gotten great literary reviews after publication, but did not sell well initially, so the author was \\"marketing\\" it through book clubs--essetially word of mouth.

No.","review":"A modern American young man visited the Taj Mahal with his wife and was inspired to write a love story. Alas, he knowns almost nothing about the Mughal history or the harem culture. And, unfortunately, he chose a period and a people that were well documented. If you disregard the names and places and the era and substitute them with a spoiled rich girl in a modern small town America, it's an interesting love story. If you expect it to having anything to do with anyone connected with the Taj Mahal or the Mughal courts, you will be sadly disappointed. The inaccuracies are everywhere. Who was it that advised writers to stick to the things they know? Good advice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great plot, but where's the character development?","review":"I agree with the reviewer who said the characters were either the essence of goodness or vile and evil. Yes, the book is a great page turner and the plot is intricate and interesting, but without dimension to the characters, it's not a memorable novel. I'm surprised by all the praise being thrown around, frankly. Maybe I just need character driven fiction to make reading worth my while--for a good yarn with no depth, I'd rather watch TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"This was a very good read, I picked it up and couldn't put it down. I enjoyed \\"The Twentieth Wife\\" and \\"Feast of Roses\\" by Indu Sundaresan much better, but this one was a great follow-up to those books because it followed the timeline after those. Plenty of suspense and you feel connected to the character. Quite a bit of lovey dovey stuff in here, so if you don't want to read a love story, this book is not for you. It follows the life of Emperor Shah Jahan and his wife Mumtaz Mahal's daughter, Jahanara. The story progresses through the building of the Taj Mahal and all the trials and tribulations she faces as a princess to the empire and sister of an evil evil brother."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought this book was just terrible!","review":"Maybe my hopes were too high, based on all the glowing reviews here, but I thought this book was just awful. The author (a man) can't write from a woman's perspective at all convincingly. The romance is flat and boring, especially if you've ever read great romantic historical fiction along the lines of \\"The Other Bolelyn Girl.\\" The \\"bad\\" character is given no possible reason for being evil, he's just bad from birth and that's that. There's a tied-up-with-a-bow happy ending that's nearly laughable.

A good idea, this work, but not engaging or emotionally satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"An OK Summer Read","review":"This was just OK for me. I liked the story, but it could've been so much more in the hands of a better writer - it felt like the telling of a story and not story-telling, and you know the difference when you read it.

The author makes wild assumptions about \\"childbirth myths\\" detailing (I'm assuming) catholic views of Eve and Mary. She attacks and generalizes the medical profession. Even after these and other unsupported claims I thought I could still use the relaxation exercises, but when she said that when the fetus kicks and moves it's because the mother or parents are experiencing stress and tension I was absolutely appalled. The fetus moving is a good sign of normal cognitive development, not something parents should try to subdue or about which they should feel guilt.

The cuts are terrific and include a couple of the cuts we heard \\"live\\" in the 1980s. Searing guitar solos with a solid backbeat that has made Les popular with many bands and well played musicians. If you liked Les's stuff in the 1980s and 1990s-this is the same only more so.

What I found was a very linear presentation of events. Though the premise of this book is touted as the story of woman who falls for men old enough to be her father, I found that this story was rather about a woman who continually falls for egocentric men who would be less than good for her, no matter what their age. And while it is often said that women who date older men have \\"father issues\\", the trail the author takes to make this point was a little abrupt to suit me.

I could never get close enough and would get a picture of the entire class on stage. Very happy now! Close ups of items are wonderful too. My daughter needed close up pictures of flowers that showed detail for her science project and I was so impressed with what we got!

There are several kata based on a polearm initiative bonus that was removed during playtesting. There are many, many typos.This book was also made with veterans in mind.

This book allows you insight into Commander Thrawn of the Chiss Ascendancy and how he begins to embark on that wrong path which will eventually lead him into the ranks of Grand Admiral of the Imperials. When I read any of Zahn's books that involve Thrawn, I cannot put them down while the pages and chapters are focused on Thrawn. He's an amazing military statistician, so cunning in his decisions. Outbound Flight is a must read not only for this alone but to understand Jedi Master C'Boath's slide to the dark side, that his clone in the Thrawn trilogy's is described in."},{"rating":"1","title":"So this is Thrawn..........","review":"Not a bad read, with some interesting twists to the plot. The character of Thrawn is well developed, but the story tends to drift through space somewhat. You'd want to think the jedi had enough backbone to oppose C'boath rather than just defer to him all the time.I dont know why Zahn even bothered to bring Obi-Wan and Anakin into the story as they were forgotten in the midst of the plot.Overall not a great story, but good enough to pass the time on a long distance trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Agreed","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I wasn't sure I would. I didn't enjoy all the Thrawn novels before and didn't like some Timothy Zahn's novels, but I really got into this book. It has a dual story that comes together at the end. I'm not going to go into a long plot summary. Amazon and other reviewers have already did that. I liked how we finally got to see how Thrawn got involved with the Republic. I was intrigued by C'boath's Jedi philosophies and how he relates to others. I agreed with a lot of the reviewers that I felt Anakin and Kenobi were thrown in there just to say they were there. They didn't really lend anything to the story. I recommend this book to Star Wars fans and it does make Survivor's Quest more understandable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"Timothy Zahn is best writer in the Starwars universe. I always look forward to his books. The adventure flows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Its amazing how a barely discussed past reference to Outbound flight can be woven into an exciting story that involves the beginning of Thrawn and Jori Car'das, as well as the insights on Old Republic Jedi, especially Jedi Master Jorus C'baoth. An exciting book and a must read after Survivor's Quest. Actually after you read Outbound flight read Survivor's Quest again, its reads totally different with the added background."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Zahn Classic","review":"Zahn's Star Wars books have always been my favorites, and this is one of his best. He manages to tie together his own characters and storyline (Thrawn, Outbound Flight, etc.) with the politics and intrigue of the Old Republic from the prequels and even provides a lead in for the New Jedi Order books (I don't hold that against him, however).If you haven't read any of Zahn's other Star Wars books, Outbound Flight may not be as much fun, since the main point of the book is to flesh out characters and history that we've been reading about for years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful 1-dimensional characters, no point","review":"Outbound Flight has a facinating premise, a Jedi expedition to discover strange new worlds, seek out new life and new civilizations etc, etc. But never delivers.Instead the story disolves into a predictable confilict between a 1-dimensional fallen Jedi and a Mary Sue-like invicible alien. Logic and drama are cast aside for an utterly predictable climax with most of the cast quietly killed off-camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thimothy Zan come's back","review":"Great book where Timothy Zan's comes back to his original way of writing 3 distinct stories that link to each others at the end.

I didn't plan on reading an account of the legion by a deserter, yet I happened to find this book in a second hand store at a cheap price so why not. Essentially the book starts out on a good note and is quite an enjoyable read, life is tough for Jennings... but hey! This is the French Foreign Legion... One would be naive to expect otherwise! However, when Jennings decides to desert little is actually clear as to why and things really don't appear all that bad for the author and ultimately the rest of the book is a complete let down and paints quite a poor picture of the author. This is quite honestly the worst book I have ever read on the legion and does not paint a negative picture of the legion or its methods... rather it paints, as I've said before, a very poor picture of the author himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dang","review":"Having owned and been very happy with the two prior Mariza DVD's I was very pleasantly surprised to find that this DVD had been released.

Victor was the first person I had met that shared my heart for these kids; I was completely moved by his life's story. He is the real deal and is the best example I know of how God can take something so broken and turn it into a beautiful thing that brings Him glory.As I watched this movie last night I was moved to tears. Victor is so open and transparent, I learned things about him that I didn't know, but more than that I know that the reason he did this movie is his complete love for the kids he serves.If it seem like I am bragging about knowing Victor and calling him friend, I am!

Mr. Marx's story is a remarkable example of the life-saving, transforming power of God. Victor's childhood experiences were unbearably harrowing and could have completely destroyed him except that the love of God stepped in and took over his heart, changing the course of his life forever. And now, because of what Victor has experienced, he is able to use his story to powerfully impact the lives of others. I saw this happen today while I watched this movie. A close loved-one of mine, having gone through very challenging circumstances as a child at the hands of a parent, was deeply affected by Victor's story and is going to share it with friends and family who have also been hurt.

I'm sorry, but I don't particularly care to watch two people yell and scream at each other for a half hour.And did they really think they were being \\"cutting edge\\" by having the character spout the word \\"frigging\\" or \\"frickin\\" ten times an episode?

The text targets people already very familiar with the story Machu Picchu, so it shouldn't be treated as a coffee table book. If you need a set of impressive pictures and easily interrupted text on current hypotheses about Machu Micchu, you have many other choices.This book belongs in an academic library, or the history section of a public library that already has a book on Machu Picchu that caters to the casual reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"I can add nothing, but only agree with the other two reviewers.

Many of the \\"power tools\\" look just like Daddy's, and they have great sound effects that are NOT annoying! (We are pretty anti- noisy electronic toys, but these sounds are fabulous -- authentic sounding but not too loud. The table saw, in particular, has the most realistic sound that my husband and I keep pushing the button over and over again in amazement.) Everything is baby-safe with no tiny parts -- package actually says 2-6 on it I think. It is sturdy and was easy for Santa to assemble. We've had several Little Tykes toys over time (an outdoor playhouse and a tiny baby-size play kitchen) and they have been durable and fun, but this is just one of the best toys I have ever seen, hands down. We expect many years of enjoyment with both fine motor skill development and pretend play!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classics won't scare you anymore","review":"I just couldn't believe Emile Zola's genius when I heard that he wrote Therese Raquin on a newspaper manager's order of a detective novel.He simply read the newspapers for a clipping about murder and started writing it. What is surprising here is not how he started the novel but how he managed to make it a classic. It is a classic indeed, with an exception that I can offer it not only to \\"classics\\" readers but to any reader who is not conservative(for the book shows pure reality that is contrary to general taboos). It has everything that a classic should have: great use of language, a style(ie naturalism ), an insight to human feelings, mentality and conflicts, permanence through the years. What's more, it has everything that a bestseller should have,too: fascination, big events like murder, intrigues, love, hatred, sensuality. Perhaps you will find even more when you read the novel. It is everything one expects from a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"text missing","review":"I have read about 40% of this book so far, so there may be more problems, but so far I have found that almost all of Chapter 20 is missing from this Kindle edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"IN FRENCH!","review":"Says item is in English.

But this translation is very poor and was done in the 1880s at the height of censorship. This publisher--which is amazon--downloaded a public domain translation and put a John Singer Sargent portrait of a rich American on the cover!!!The story is about an unattractive downtrodden French woman, not an heiress.

Ok, it is the begining of a new era that Zola creates but I mean, if almost 80 pages goes to just describe the same thing over and over again then...ZzZzZz. He is very skilled in his naturalistic way of describing it all but this novel would have been so much better if it would have been a short story. Unfortunately the short story does not get almost any attention in the litterary world so Zola did not have much of a choice. It is a novel that should not escape any readers attention because it is one of the novels that every man should know about. Pardon my spelling but that has never been my good side."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way ahead of its time","review":"This was my first cookbook, bought when it was hot off the press, and even though I now own dozens of books, I go back to this one time and again. But it really was ahead of its time, with an emphasis on complex carbohydrates that's still hard to find. I think it deserves to be updated (ingredients that were were rare in the 80's can now be found in almost any supermarket, and much more is known about nutrition), new recipes added, and marketed for a wider audience than vegetarians."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very tasty","review":"Full of hundreds of great recipes. Being a nutritionalist, the author presents about 100 pages of info about nutrition, preparing a meal, food selection, and the rest is many great dishes. It seems to have a down home flavor with porage and home made bread as well as just about anything else you want. Some of the recipes may be a bit time consuming but worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable read, so-so recipes","review":"I feel kind of nostalgic about Laurel's Kitchen because an earlier edition was part of my introduction to meatless cooking in our co-op kitchen back in college. At one time, this book and a handful of others were the only vegetarian cookbooks \\"out there.\\" I forgot about it for many years, then it came to my attention again and I purchased this updated edition.There are so many other great vegetarian cookbooks out now that these seem slightly uninspired by comparison. I have made several of the recipes, and despite following them to the letter, each and every one seemed kind of bland. I had forgotten about that factor, or I guess I didn't mind it at the time. I have zippier versions of many of the recipes in other cookbooks, but for some people, the blandness and simplicity could be a plus. I think this is a good basic handbook for someone new to vegetarian cooking who is not looking for anything spicy or exotic. The book is enjoyable and informational to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laurel's Kitchen","review":"I had a copy of this book years ago and lent it to a friend. Needless to say, I never got it back. Just recently I wanted to get another copy and found one on Amazon. Hurray!!! I love the soups. They are just terrific. I'm getting to know the book and the recipes again and believe me I won't be lending it to any one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, Healthy Recipes","review":"This is one of my most-used cookbooks, even though I am not a vegetarian. This book is perfect for anyone looking to get more vegetables into their diet. It contains many simple recipes that taste astoundingly good. For example - I never liked cauliflower until I tried the cauliflower soup recipe from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Narrow minded prose with lackluster recipes","review":"I am, for lack of a better explanation, an omnivore in a caring relationship with a vegetarian. Since I do most of the cooking, I often search through vegetarian cookbooks for ideas and recipes for us or just to make for her. In truth, this book deeply insulted me. The author's repeated attacks on those of us who eat meat were offensive to me personally and I would think to anyone with an open minded view of the world. If you happen to be a militant vegan, this book may just be your style. As for the rest of the general populace, the recipes were pedestrian and the viewpoints were unwelcome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Political polemic with time wasting recipes","review":"The original book was an anti-technology diatribe. The authors waste time creating a strawman \\"nutrition establishment\\" with whom to argue while the reality is that the American Dietetic Association has long been aware that a good vegetarian diet is possible.Definitely a book by and for upper middle class women who needn't work - to one such as myself it sounds like the bizarre rantings of a species from a different planet.I use the book for ideas, but I modify the recipes using classic cookery tricks and machinery to speed and ease the process after a 10 hour workday."},{"rating":"1","title":"fat-o-phobia","review":"Because I am not a fat-o-phobe, I bought the book to be inspired by healthy and delicious grains, vegetables, and fruit. I was disappointed. In my opinion, based on trying many, there were a few recipes that were OK, perhaps a dozen or so in the entire book. In any case, most data from epidemiological studies does not clearly support the low-fat craze, although I'm not recommending someone eat 2 lbs. of butter or oil with every meal. At least for my taste, the Moosewood or Enchanted Broccoli Forest was a richer source of inspiration and flavor."},{"rating":"2","title":"new version of old standard","review":"this updated version of one of my first cookbooks many years ago is fabulouswith lots of nutritional information and updated,healthy recipes"},{"rating":"1","title":"Textbook Definition","review":"It's a textbook and I was looking for something more. I guess I was hoping to find not just different definitions of the types of communication, but strategies for improving them.

It didn't. I was looking for something that this book doesn't offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't use it","review":"I ordered this microphone for my son for Christmas.

There are no recommended bearings, axles, headset, or materials. There are no references to the use of modern bicycle components, although my copy was updated in 2005. There is minimal design guidance.There are lots of high level, exploded components diagrams and some B&W; photos of unicycles and \\"artistic\\" bicycles. If you are ready to build a unicycle after reading the book, you were ready before reading it.If you want the type of material which should have been in this book, buy \\"Atomic Zombie's Bicycle Builder's Bonanza\\".

To my disappointment, once you turn off the radio the clock shuts off too. There is no AC adapter, so your three AAA batteries die quickly and the clock will need to be reset anyway. It is more trouble than it is worth.Not a good buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, bad product","review":"I bought this clock for my 9-year old. The sound quality is so poor that it's difficult to understand both my son's self-recorded wake up message, and the clocks pre-recorded time announcement. The volume is so loud we put the clock in a drawer when our baby is napping (in another room). Additionally, the clock is supposed to announce the time if you clap. However, it announces the time in response to all sorts of noises, such as \\"THREE EIGHTEEN AM\\" when my son rolls over in bed. High points for durability because I've \\"accidently\\" knocked it off the dresser, top bunk etc. several times and it keeps ticking. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fixed the clock, now can't make it stop telling the time!","review":"For anyone who is having trouble with the clock switching off..i too had the same situation until I went to the Wild Planet website. Their help section shows the answer:Q: Help! When I switch the radio on, the clock switches off!A: Ask an adult to check that all five AAA batteries are fitted. There are two battery compartments, one for the radio and one for the clock. The clock battery compartment is behind the radio battery compartmentOf course, once I put in all 5AAA batteries, the clock won't quite telling the time. Apparently the clap on feature is picking up any tiny noise. Of course, I went into a quiet noiseless closet and it's still yelling the time.So, it looks pretty, the concept is ingenious but they failed on the construction. It needs an adapter for ac option, a volume control and a sensitivity level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Momof five","review":"Santa brought my 2 boys these for Christmas. I have to say I am disappointed with it's preformance. You can not understand the time announcment. It's very crackly. The radio part is Okay. The but as another reviewer said the clock only lights up with noise. and then it will announce the time in that horrid crackly sound you can not understand.It is a great idea and my hat is off to the child that invented it, but It could have been manufactured much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY!!!","review":"Unless you plan on having 5 AA batteries on hand at all time, this is not for you. It doesn't run on AC, so if the batteries die and you don't have any on hand, your child doesn't have an alarm clock. You can't tell what time it is at night because the time only lights up when the clock annouces the time, which is whenever there is any sort of noise in the house, and then you can't understand it because it is so loud. There is no volumn switch. Stay away from Room Gear items until they get all the bugs out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointment, very poorly made","review":"1) Batteries last about three weeks. that is 15 sets of five alkaline batteries a year. IE about $45 in batteries to run this clock for a year. so it isn't an $18 clock it is a $63 clock...or probably the most expensive alrm clock you ever bought.The voice feature is the worst of any voice simulation I ever heard. You simply cannot understand it.The clock turns off when the radio is on. Great can't see what time it is if you have it set to radio as alarm!On might have expected such poor design if this had been another \\"character-based\\" merchandise, but it isn't, making the irnony of its junkyness even worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"returning ITEM","review":"This is a piece of JUNK.......the radio is the only good feature.......The voice sounds as if he is talking with a mouth full of marbles and you really cannot understand the time it is very sensitive you don't have to clap several sounds activate the so called message that needs a Speech Therapist ***I agree DO NOT BUY Until they get the bugs OUT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying","review":"The premise is good...letting kids wake to their own voice, clapping to get the time, etc. However, this clock can't pull it off. First of all, the voice that states the time is very loud and the recording is not clear. There is no way to change the volume of the voice. Second, the voice goes off with the sound of any movement, not just clapping. So, throughout the night, you hear this annoying voice stating the time.This clock does teach the basics of using an alarm clock, which was great for my daughter (age 8). However, I plan to return it to get a clock that is less annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing clock","review":"This clock seemed like a fun idea, but it doesn't work as promised.

The playing is limp and completely lacking either sparkle or Powell's usual nervous energy. I would hate for someone unfamiliar with Powell to buy this CD to try him out and be disappointed thinking this is what all the fuss is about. The other of Powell's RCA recordings (Swingin' with Bud) is far superior, if still not in the first rank of Powell performances. For those, you need to go to the first two volumes of \\"The Amazing Bud Powell\\", or some of his Verve recordings.

The instrumental \\"One Wish\\" is their greatest musical masterpiece ever, and I doubt that they'll ever top it. Barbara Long did an excellent job in performing \\"Save Yourself For Me\\". This song is great to listen to when you're with someone special, on a couch or sharing a blanket while sitting underneath a sea of stars.Though this album's instrumentals are sensational, I decided to give it four stars. I enjoyed \\"Save Yourself For Me\\" & \\"Stay Away\\", but the rest of the songs with lyrics are rather hokey, and they don't do justice for Barbara Long's tremendous talent for singing.That aside, \\"Another Place\\" is a classic & memorable piece from Hiroshima."},{"rating":"2","title":"Traditional Japanese Music + Jazz = Fusion","review":"Although Fusion Jazz wasn't used much when this album came out in 1985, Hiroshima was definitely a pioneer in that area. They were the first Japanese group to have a video on BET (Black Entertainment Television). The Best cuts on this album are One Wish and Another Place. A great album to listen to!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a great place...","review":"Before smooth jazz there was Hiroshima doing there thing, this was the lp that introduced me to them and I love this record 21yrs later! the intrumentals are still played to this day, the vocals, 'Save Yourself For Me' got great airplay in 1985 featuring the amazing voice of Barbara Long, 'The Game', 'Undercover', 'What's It To Ya, & 'Touch and Go' have that great 80's keyboard sound, 'Stay Away' is wonderful, a great record in the Hiroshima catalog!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great for telecommuting","review":"I telecommute and I've been looking for a headset compatible speakerphone that would work well in my environment. I needed a speakerphone capable of full-duplex operation to make it possible to barge into conference calls. I bought the Soundpoint Pro, but I'm somewhat disappointed for the following reasons:- volume range on speakerphone is too limited (I have to use a headset to \\"tune in\\" quiet speakers).- the speed dial mechanism is cumbersome - scroll through a list and then press \\"speed dial\\" rather than pressing a programmed button.- the sound quality is rather bassy- the number sequence programming is too short. I can't program enough digits to get one button access to voice mail (need 25 digits including pauses)- no \\"new call\\" light- no display light- not enough lines in CID displayI'll probably return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same Polycom in your office . . .","review":"This product is no where close to the quality that I expected from the Sound Stations in my office. First, the highest level speaker volume is way too low (I have had better volume from phone line powered speakerphones). Second, the speed dial design is terrible (see other reviews, but my reasons include that you can only store an 8 character description for each number and dialing any stored number is a 3 step process). For the price, the Panasonic TMC98 is a better choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-Priced, Features Don't Match Polycom Name","review":"I bought this phone because of the great quality of the Polycom office speakerphones. What a disappointment it has proven to be:- Speakerphone functions are poor. Incoming sound is very good, but the mic picks up less well than $40 Panasonic speakerphones. - Odd controls are difficult to get used to - switching between calls is awkward, and you'll lose or mistakenly conference calls until you figure out control sequence that are simpler on other phone brands. - LCD display is one of the worst thought out I've ever seen. Incoming and outgoing numbers are shown for a few seconds, then the display shows \\"SoundPoint Pro\\" instead. Polycom sacrificed function here to show its brand, even though the brand is written all over the phone anyway! - Cabling is unnecessarily complex and ugly.It would be bad enough if the phone were competitively priced, but there is no reason to pay the Polycom premium for this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Support","review":"The speaker phone is clear but the maximum volume is too low.Our phone stopped working after 13 months.

Neither the handset nor the speaker phone works and the LCD display has gone blank (but the LEDs light-up). I called the customer support line and they recognized the problem. But they will not replace or fix the phone without charging me ... since the one-year warranty period ran out four months ago. Obviously I am not going to pay ... for a refurbised phone, especially since I was never really happy with it. Its duplex feature never quite worked well and the mic was not sensitive enough and the speaker volume never went high enough. Overall, the quality of Polycom's home products are drastically inferior to its office products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep your expectations low...","review":"I enjoyed the Polycom speaker phone for about 1 year. The unit looked good, and the speakerphone was decent - but not 'awe inspiring' by any stretch. It certainly doesn't measure up to the conference phones I use at work, also from Polycom (why I decided on that brand in the first place).So - after spending 200+, I ended up with a phone that lasted a year. It no longer disconnects the phone line, and I have to pull the phone jack in order for the phone to disconnect.For what it's worth, I will just spend $40 to replace it & get the same features. If it lasts a year, that's okay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after one day","review":"The sound quality of the speaker was fantastic. But when I started using it on calls everybody agreed that my voice sounded tinny and wanted me to pick up the receiver. It's pretty embarrassing when you tell clients that you're using a state-of-the art speaker phone and they tell you to pick up the receiver because you're hard to understand. After one day the microphone stopped working altogether. This is not what I was expecting from the Polycom name. Don't bother buying this phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced & Underperforms","review":"I was entering a speed dial number, had to refer to the manual. I had already entered the number and played the letter game to get the name in, back to the manual to figure out what \\"set priority tag\\" means, okay, back to the phone ... NOT ... the phone decided to time-out my programming an erase everthing. This pretty much sums up this phone.Note that the phone is WARM. They have changed something from the prior versions so that when you pick up the handset the mouthpiece section that rests against your chin is actually warm to the touch, and you get a nice \\"warm plastic smell\\". Tech support says, \\"yea, mine is hot, too.\\" Note that my previous phones were NOT hot.This is clearly not Polycom's core strenth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Conferencing, lack features and bad user interface","review":"First of all, this phone has no support for the phone company's voice mail system. The user interface is terrible, you have to push 3 buttons to speeddial, and it is even more difficult to program it. Call history is also very awkward to use. Granted, the quality of the speaker phone is better, but not that much better. The RCA jack is very convenient for recording conversations. The phone is bulky The plastic is cheaply made. The price doesn't live up to the cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs more volume","review":"I have one. The only reason why I am looking for a different phone now is because the volume is too low.

Lattimore, however, brings his extraordinary knowledge of Greek, combined with his genius of poetic sensibility, to this new translation. I recommend this book highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Catchy It's Hard To Fathom!","review":"Overboard is a fantastic instrumental surf rock album. I can't say I know for sure, but I think The Fathoms have since called it quits, and that's a real shame coz they would be one of the top contenders in the scene. Overboard is a great ride that'll surely take you to another place if you let it. It's got a slightly laid back sound that adds bits of other genres to the mix, yet never loses it's \\"surf\\" sound. Very, very, very highly recommended if you're a surf rock fan. It really sucks that such a good album could be out of print. Lets just hope it's rereleased. If you can track it down, and you can pay for it without taking out a loan, then in the words of Arnold Schwarzenegger, DO IT!! DO IT!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BIG DOULBLE THUMBS UP!!","review":"My autistic then 10 year old played with this and absolutely loves it. My husband said he used to have a radio shack version similar but made out of cardboard when he was a kid. This plastic set is a wee bit fragile so some care does need to be taken about that.We have since wowed 2 classes at school with this and he used it in a science fair and the 6 year old has even put it together.It is quite the hit at our house!I like it over the larger kits because it is smaller (less pieces to loose/break) and is a pretty quick gratification (goes together fairly quickly).It is well worth the money but is a gateway drug to wanting the larger kits (but that is what grandparents and santa are for!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for even younger ages","review":"I bought this product simply because it is cheap, the parts are obviously easier to manage (because they are snap on) and thus great for kids, and it was a good experience to give some introductions to electricity to my kids. My daughter is 5, and my son is 3. I was able to explain the flow of current and demonstrated how the flow of electricity controlled the direction of the motor. Beyond that, the toy aspect took over as they both enjoyed launching the flying saucer. The 5 year old was able to place the saucer back on its launch plate, where as the 3 year old was not. That really doesn't matter as I purchased this toy as a kind of \\"us\\" toy, as its something I could spend time with them doing. I used to have a \\"150 in 1\\" kit when I was growing up, and as complicated as that kit was, its good to see smaller kits are coming out with parts that are much easier to manage for younger children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome toy!","review":"My little science professor (6 yr old) loves this toy!

Stands up well to use. Lots of use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not durable.","review":"I purchased this for my 4 year old son who has made basic circuits on the Snap Circuits Jr. The helicopter disk on the Snap Circuits Jr set had been well used by my older son, so all I really needed was the replacement. What was in this package was a flimsy disk that didn't even fit on the motor. It was a disappointment since the Snap Circuits Jr kid was so durable and well made. I was expecting the same quality but this Snap Circuits Flying Saucer was obviously made in a different factory with different quality control standards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for electricity enthusiasts","review":"My son received this toy for his 10th birthday present. He loved it. He has enjoyed putting many of the projects together many times. Although this toy does not teach how electricity actually works, it gives the child a positive experience with building circuits and radios, lights, etc. Hopefully this will contribute to a greater understanding when these topics are actually covered in school."},{"rating":"2","title":"Above average toy, SUPER price, imagination required","review":"$10 bucks and free shipping - it is worth buying.Easy to assemble, the educational value is overrated though, it snaps together in a durable way but I'm not sure it taught my 8 year old much about the flow of electricity unless I were to get out the whiteboard and explain it further.It works very well. If you set it on the ground and let the flyin saucer go, it will hit the ceiling easily. I never took it outside but I estimate it would fly around 10' high on each and every launch.Other reviewers are right, it does seem to get old. But, we tried tilting it sideways and shooting it into a bucket, and he uses it as a \\"base\\" that his action figures must protect before the launch is made, etc. It, alone, is quite boring but encourage them to use their imagination and it will become one of their most favorite toys for around $10.I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loved this!","review":"What a great way to have fun and learn aout electricity.

Thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to build with a parent or alone","review":"My six-year-old son received this as a birthday gift and he was super-excited to open it up and try it out. Usually he waits for his dad to help him with toys like this but he was able to make the flying saucer fly about in minutes all on his own. It flies up pretty high! Our ceilings here are up to about 10-20 feet high (angled) and I'd say the saucer was going up to about 15 feet, launched from the coffee table and sofa. Once his dad came home, they made some of the other builds and had a lot of fun with it. The flying saucer is still his favorite one though. My husband loves toys like this that he can use to teach our son with while also having fun. It is always great to see them excited to learn!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than a sharp stick in the eye...but not by much!","review":"This is the best film of a sorry lot of L & H films made in the '40's. And the sorry isn't just Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy's creativity being confined by the large movie studios, in this case 20th Century Fox. Stan looks old and tired. Ollie is no longer just a big guy, he is sloppily fat. Contrary to the prevailing Laurel and Hardy fan clubs party line this film (and the other '40's films) isn't just bad because of the nasty movie moguls imposing rigorous constraints on the boys; it' also bad because-sad to say-the boys are just going through the motions. It's easy to say that they should have quit instead of embarassing themselves but apparently the income was needed; I wish they had saved their money and had quit while on top."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong info","review":"The info provided is for spark plug wire in the bulk, but yet the main title says it is a Raybestos set of brake shoes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Four Past Midnight The Langliers","review":"This book is just like the movie, The Langliers and I bought this book because I wanted the story of the Langliers in the book.

Although I skipped the Langoliers, having read it before, the other stories are more than worth the price of the book. Secret Window, Secret Garden entranced me from page 1 to end. The Library Policeman and Sundog are both truly scary. With each new book of his that I read, I keep thinking that this one has to be a blooper, he can't possibly write that many great stories.

Oh, and from what I've read, don't read Secret Window-Secret Garden. ~Katie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mature, moving stories","review":"Stephen King once wrote that he's still interested in things that go bump in the night, but that his more recent books tend to focus more on the people who may...or may not...be listening. These short stories fit that category, from the weary airline pilot-divorcee Captain Engle and then hardened Nick Hopewell who experiences a foxhole change of heart, to the small-town average Sam Peebles who hides a lifetime secret, King introduces us to characters we can care about. The character development makes the surreal storylines of the book all the more fascinating and poignant. \\"Langoliers\\" was fun to try to figure out as you go along; \\"Library Policeman\\" yields impressive psychological maturity; \\"The Sun Dog\\" is engrossing. Only \\"Secret Window, Secret Garden\\" left me cold.

These stories are just long enough to hold you in and make you be just on the edge of your seat. I saw the movie Secret Window and after needed to read the book. All four of these stories lived up to expectation and for $6 on the kindle you are crazy not to pick this book up."},{"rating":"2","title":"King At His Best!","review":"It is very rare for me to come across a book especially of this length that i can't put down which is what happened with Four Past Midnight. I was so intrigued by the fascinating details and suspense that the four novellas had. Not one of these stories had any dragging details nor was any of these hard to follow. Although it is almost impossible to pick a favorite here are my top four:1. The Sun Dog2. Libray Policeman3. The Langoliers4. Secret Window, Secret Garden.Stephen King never ceases to amaze me at how well he is able to write his stories and these four novellas prove why.

I can't say that enough.The machine is very sensitive. When it decides something is wrong it simply won't do ANYTHING but flash its error light. When this happens all you can do is unplug it and restart the unit. Last week I had to do that 3x in a 35 minute period.I took away a star because of the paper jams and the extreme sensitivity as well as the flimsy paper tray bar and paper tray lid which contribute to the reoccurring flash of the error light.

Because I think that had Steinberg been willing to write on a higher intellectual plane, this book could have been a great book instead of an OK one. Steinberg keeps asserting that Elisha ben Abuyah (the main character) finds traditional Judaism, and later secularism, intellectually unsatisfying.

Brings to life a little know time of ancient Israel. Steinberg paints a picture of life in ancient Israel during the time of the Roman occupation just prior to the final days of the Judean War that answers so many questions of those of us who only knew the period through religious readings. The dilemma that faces the novel's protagonist is a problem that is as current in today's assimilated society as it was in the days when Jews were facing the pull toward Hellenism. Unwilling to accept Judaism's blind faith in God, the protagonist returns to the Hellenistic roots of his childhood, only to find that he loses his place in either world.

Bad mistake. The battery by renata lasts nearly twice as long as any of the others we tried. Well worth the slight extra cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tediously talky relationship study","review":"I think my title says it all.Other reviews I read indicate this movie was an adaptation from a play, and I'm afraid it really shows. There are incessant dialogues between the two main characters which are tedious and rather stilted. It is established early on that both characters have been badly hurt in previous relationships and are having trouble opening up and becoming vulnerable to one another. These issues are stated and restated too many times during several scenes of the movie.I agree with another reviewer who indicated that there is not a lot of chemistry between the two leads. To tell you the truth, I think Mitchum is miscast. MacLaine is fine; the sweetness and vulnerability underlying her transparent tough-girl facade is a sort of variation on the female lead in her previous film, \\"The Apartment.\\" Come to think of it, I wonder what this movie would have been with Jack Lemmon in place of Robert Mitchum. Oh, well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeesh. What a dud.","review":"Yeesh. One of those dreadful Sixties Dramas (please note the portentious use of Capital Letters) that are Boldly Adapted from a Stage Play, and full of Psychology-laden monologues and horrendously overwritten, absurdly unnatural-sounding repartee. Shirley MacLaine is a \\"bohemian\\" Jewish girl, living in the nutty clamour of Greenwich Village (which we see very little of, sadly), and Robert Mitchum is the \\"square\\" from Omaha who barges into her life and begins bossing her around, in an effort to recapture his Lost Masculinity. The film is interminable and way too stagey. MacLaine has some winsome moments, and the B&W cinematography is kinda nice, but nothing can save this overly-mannered shipwreck from foundering, again and again, on the shoals of its own pretensions. I guess in some ways I feel lucky that I wasn't living in New York back in the Kennedy era, when you'd have to go to the theatre and take this sort of boring pseudo-sermonizing seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Doesn't hold up\\" is an understatement","review":"I'll be brief: I viewed Seesaw recently on TCM after not having seen it for many years. I had fond memories of the film when I originally saw it back in the late '60s. However, upon seeing it again, I was very disappointed, realizing that it is now a completely dated, unendurably sexist flick. In one uncomfortable scene, Mitchum slaps MacLaine forcefully on the face...both agreeing, of course, that she totally deserved it.Ugh.

Lee and as a Texan, the title and cover of the book grabbed my attention. There's an awful lot written about Lee's Civil War exploits and even a fair about of info about his Mexican War experiences. Unfortunately there's almost nothing written about the years immediately preceding the Civil War. This book covers that. If you're familiar with geographics of Texas, you'll especially find the book interesting. Lee journeyed through West Texas, South Texas, the border area along the Rio Grande and the Hill country in and around San Antonio. He chased Commanches (who proved quite elusive) and bandits throughout West and South Texas. The book is an easy read. If you've read much about Lee at all, you should get this book.

Fires rampant on the west coast and a hurricane devastated Louisiana. I saw this 10 years ago when it came out and feared this might happen.

This wasn't as sexy as the first, Sean Blakemore simply read his way through the part, and Joe Torry basiclally played the same role he did in Poetic Justice. Brian White gives a dead-on personification of Shemar Moore's role in the first film, so it was believeable that he was an estranged brother. I thought the plot wasn't as tightly wound as the first, but everything seemed to pull together at the end, which kinda didn't make sense: did Connie plan to use Brandon all the while?

Then there was Raleigh who was constantly described as emitting a low hum and caring more about his attire than all else. Oh yeah, he sounds like the man of my dreams. The \\"plot\\" revolves around a bit of a mystery which is just too stupid to even contemplate. For me, the only mystery of this book is how in the heck these two people fell in love!! I especially felt bad for Raleigh when all Jane did was B**ch and moan at him all day long....How this was published.. I have no idea....there are too many books and too little time to waste it on this mess. In my humble opinion....I say skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad, bad, bad...","review":"I am not sure why anyone would like this book let alone love it. Sure, sometimes it gets old reading regencies about perfect looking people but I think readers are wrong to equate surly and nasty with being interesting because the lady is not beautiful. In fact, for me, Jane's very unattractiveness was compounded by her really bad behavior. There was no way anyone would be attracted to Jane as she is so unkind and nasty.

Baker is a very clever and witty book that is written in an interesting point of view. The Frog Princess is an enchanting fiction novel that is told by a young princess, who is my favorite character, that lives in a dream world of magic where humans can communicate with animals, witches are familiar, and where you have to watch out for the frogs that want a kiss. But it shows to be harder for some than others to resist the temptation of an annoying frog.I was glad that I decided on this book. The Frog Princess took many unexpected twists and turns and I can guarantee that you haven't read a book like this. To be honest, the plot was very slow. It seemed the little details were stretched too much and the parts that seemed suspenseful didn't heighten your suspense. All in all,it was a very good book and I would recommend this book to anyone who is tired of the books that all seem the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Frog Princess","review":"Well, this was your typical fairy tale,a spin-off of the frog prince. Princess meets Prince, there's a magic kiss, some great adventure, and magic saves the day(of course). I really didn't like this book.

When I began this story I thought it was cute and I enjoyed the detailed descriptions from the princess' perspective. But as the book went on I found myself dreading reading more. The story is very simple and wouldn't have been so bad if the author had stayed focused and edited out about 50 pages. At the end it seems like book soup with a variety of leftovers thrown in to make it last longer. It really ruined the flavor for me.This may be better for the young independent reader and parents reading aloud might want to try 'The Prince of the Pond: Otherwise Known as De Fawg Pin' by Donna Jo Napoli instead.

I am usually the girl that falls head over heels for anything related to the fairy tale genre. So this really should have been up my alley. But it seemed to me that nothing could be properly focused. Don't get me wrong; it was a nice enough plot with some great creative ideas somewhere in the background. But for the life of me I could not figure out what this silly bunch of characters was trying to do. And this really could have been a great book. After all, it's the Frog Prince story with a twist. And that is a fairy tale where one could go far with a twist.

Nearly every line/scene/twist in \\"The Frog Princess\\" was predictable and at the same time improbable, as if the characters and dialogue were drawn from one the last twenty years' Disney flicks. Very easy stereotypes are drawn with a broad brush and and then supposedly debunked (girls are allowed to guffaw and this can make them TRULY ORIGINAL, your seeming enemy might ACTUALLY be your FRIEND!), and the characters are unlikeable, unless you like characters that are one-dimensional and motivated by the simplest of events and emotions.

I found the book hard to stomach. There was a huge age difference between the characters which threw me off, but I can look past that if the story is good. Then her transformation in so short a time, it was less than a month and the governess had changed her into a lady. Then, within the first month he tries to loosen up her up with some alcohol and make a play for her. Yet, after the governess leaves and he starts teaching her he doesn't try anything for 6 months, then he gets hammered and rapes her. I found the sex scenes disturbing as they seemed to border on rape rather than love - sure she became willing, but it came across to me as a young girl enthralled with a father figure rather than love. Sebastian was a cold unfeeling brute through most of the book and I just couldn't sympathize with his character. I usually love Karen Robards, but this is the first book of hers that I couldn't stomach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh, My Lord!","review":"Loving Julia is a fantastic story about a cold, arrogant Earl (Sebastian) and a charming female \\"gutter-snipe\\" (Julia) that finds herself on his doorstep.If I could give you three reasons to read this book they are as follows; Sebastian, Sebastian, Sebastian. He seems like a snobby, heartless, bastard, but his moments with Julia are special. It seems Sebastian is constantly the cause of the ups and downs between them and it's heartbreaking and heartwarming at the same time.My only complaint would be that I could barely understand what Jewel Combs was saying when she had her street-accent.I would recommend this book, but it still doesn't measure up to Dark of the Moon, which is my favorite novel by Robards."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Loving Julia","review":"I read this book because I had just finished Karen Robard's \\"This Side of Heaven\\", which was clever, funny, and so unusual.\\"Loving Julia\\" was such a disappointment. Julia acted like a tramp and then got insulted when she was treated like one.I felt absolutely nothing for Sebastian, except that he was a borish bully with too much money and too much time on his hands.This book was much the same as other Regency romances. In the end I expected that it would be discovered she was a princess or some other ridiculous thing, but thank heavens we were spared that."},{"rating":"1","title":"yikes","review":"i love karen robards and i wanted to love this book.

On \\"Most Famous Hits,\\" Gene signs lead on \\"My Marie\\", \\"Washington Square,\\" and several others. A number of these songs are not readily available elsewhere.

Although Keshner spins some interesting yarns, his stories are clearly more fantasy than reality. He also has a crudeness to his writing that I didn't find amusing, entertaining or funny. The airline business is full of fun and amusing stories, I just didn't find Keshner's very amusing or believable. Save your money and look elsewhere for your airline stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, not great!","review":"I'm actually still reading this book. But so far its been a good read. The author Steven Kesher talks about his personal experience being an airline pilot and gives alot of accounts of places he's had to stay/visit during his career. I was hoping for more stories about actual cockpit and flying experiences although there are some in the book. The story definitely reads as a, 'good ol boys', and when flying was much more fun.

I gave it a shot and almost stopped reading after the chapter about the flight attendant with the flash light, but I continued on and I'm glad I did, because I couldn't put the thing down. I prefer character driven books and that's exactly what I got.

He's not a pretty boy, politically correct, metrosexual writer. He's just like you and me; living and breathing as a flawed person, trying to make it in life. The stories come across as real and not dressed up to impress the reader of some PC holiness on Keshner's part.The book is a collection of stories of life as a regular guy pilot. It is sometimes crude, racist, sexist, pornographic, and proudly heterosexual. In other words, you're reading the story as if you were sitting with Keshner at a bar over beers listening to all that he's experienced.To be honest, the book deserves two stars for the low-quality of writing that Keshner puts forth; if you're a college English professor teaching writing, you'll go nuts reading the book. On the basis of content, however, I give the book four stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a wast of time","review":"It speaks volumes that Bill O'Reily loved this book.The book is a horrid waste of time and waste of money. The sexist attitude towards flight attendants, homophobic comments, and childish approach towards 'scoring with a stew', is what you would expect from a High Schooler and not a pilot.I've worked for an airline for years, spent many hours in cockpit and never experienced the outrageous behavior the author has described. Pilots sleeping on the floor while a newbie on a 747 flies the entrie HNL-AKL leg, does not happen.

I would also recommend \\"Legacy of Ashes\\" by Tim Weiner as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly unbalanced","review":"Knightley's book, while interesting in places, is very much a \\"child of its time\\": he uncritically repeats many of the more shrill and naive arguments made by the Left against intelligence services in the 1970s.

There is a very brief prologue summarizing the role Ulysses (Odysseus) played in the fall of Troy (the Iliad), but then it starts full-steam with the tales of the Odyssey. It's intended for younger readers, but I enjoyed it immensely. It was fun to relearn the Odyssey after 20 or so years. The stories are not told in a high literary form; instead, the voice used by Evslin sounds more like listening to your grandfather spin a tale, but it works. Yes, the violence and death are included. The illustrations heading each chapter are particularly interesting, very psychedelic, and appropriate considering that this was first published in 1969."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ulysses; Myth or Man?","review":"Ulysses. His adventures are beyond imagination. After fighting the Trojan Wars, it took him about 10 years to get back home. On his way, he battled the great one-eyed Cyclops, went to the world of Darkness, visited the underworld, but he was able to survive and reach home. This is a book of action, adventure, and wit. Ulysses was faced with numerous obstacles, harsh decisions, and enemies, all trying to prevent him from returning home. Ulysses was able to overcome every obstacle and make his way home. This is a great book, and I really enjoyed reading it. I recommend this book to anyone with a taste of adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Homer for All Ages","review":"I bought this book to read to and teach myths to my special education students.

I was also displeased in finding out that when the iPaq was equiped with the PCMCIA expansion pack, it would not (easily) fit into the case. Additionally, there is a leather flap with velcro to secure the device from the top. This means if you have a Compact Flash or PCMCIA device that excedes the height of the iPaq, this flap will prove to be nothing but an inconvenience. Alternativly, if you are not using an expansion pack, you might as well surgically remove the flap as it blocks nearly all of the infrared port.On the whole, it provides modest protection, albeit most for the screen, but leaves much to be desired. Also the additional slots are few and not diverse enough for anything other than credit cards or business cards."},{"rating":"1","title":"No honor for amazon.com to recommend this for IPAQ 1935","review":"Very misleading.

I particularly liked the \\"Key Terms\\" and \\"Objectives\\" at the beginning of each chapter, which was great for quickly seeing what REALLY is included in a chapter, which is often difficult to tell in textbooks just from the chapter title. The book also includes facsimiles of actual forms in the documentation section, and there is nothing quite like seeing the real thing. A very well rounded look at long term care. Lots of pictures and charts keep things moving along, and there are self-assessment exams.

Knowing that Dreiser himself was inspired by Crime and Chatiment, from who you know........well it certainly makes you want to read it, don't it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tragic American Tale","review":"An American Tragedy is a lengthy book in which Dreiser refuses to leave out any detail. Although the underlying plot is intersting and suspenseful Dreiser manages to dull the story with lengthy descriptions. When one reads this book they are brought on the roller coaster of the contempelations of good and evil, fun and dull that Clyde Griffths, the main character, goes through. Dreiser also uses foreshadowing as a repetitive literary device. After the first of the three books, the reader feels as though they know what will happen through the many obvious forshadows. While I realize that this book is considered a book of good merit, I feel that after the fifth-hundred page I was ready to put the book to rest forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"LONG, but VERY good and interesting book","review":"This is the first book I've ever read by Dreiser, and although it took me awhile to read, and it was an assignment for my English class, i really, really enjoyed it. I love the way Dreiser presents Clyde as being someone who always runs from his problems, as many of us do, but then shows how it all catches up with him in the end. It's really a good life lesson. . .for all of us. You play, you pay. He made bad decisions, and he had to pay the consequences."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read of American literature","review":"It's a tragic but story about Clyde Griffiths a poor relation to a rich, factory owner. In Book 1 he gets in trouble with the law after being a car that killed a young girl. He gets a job at his uncle's factory where he eventually meets poor but beautiful Roberta Alden, a factory hand. He meets Sondra Finchley, a rich girl who associates with Clyde's cousin.However I believe the reason he was with Sondra Finchley was not love but curiousity of her being rich.The murder trial towards the end of the book was a bit long and almost boring but the end is worth it.I cried several times throughout the book. For Clyde and Roberta too.It's based on a true story about the Gilette family. You know, the ones you buy razors from.Read it and let it open up a world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Men in White","review":"Compare this to The Bonfire of the Vanities, another attempt to illustrate twentieth century US society through the hubris and public humiliation of one man. Do we want to spend the majority of the book on the formative years of the protagonist and his victim? Wolfe wisely placed the crime just one hundred pages into his seven hundred page book. Dreiser, by contrast, gives us five hundred pages of back story before starting the real drama, which focuses all the characters and institutions - - courts, politics, newspapers, business, church - - on Clyde Griffiths. The characters are real enough, the societal critique valid enough, but, for large parts, the delivery is about as subtle and engaging as that of Clyde's street preacher parents."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"This novel baffles me. Dreiser is capable of so much more - read Sister Carrie for instance, written around 1900 but still capable of transfixing the reader today with one of the first (unpoliticized) portrayals of a woman transformed from suffering victim to survivor and victor.But while Sister Carrie shattered cliches which hadn't even been recognized yet, An American Tragedy is a long book that reads very much like an extended cliche."},{"rating":"2","title":"American triumph","review":"An American Tragedy I think the best American novel to date.It's about poverty resulting in greed combined with the egotism and blindness of adolescence, finally leading to murder. Tragic and deeply touching. I call the book a triumph because it is immensely humane as it seeks the social causes of criminal behaviour and shows the absolute wrongness of the death penalty.The book is beautifully written and it will keep the reader in its spell, even long afterwards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coming from a fan of tragedy...","review":"Coming from a fan of tragedy I hope those who read this review will complacently accept my words when saying that this novel is rich in emotion, and character. Dreiser does a great job at keeping the descriptions to the bare minimum...only the details necessary to paint the picture needed to tell the story which is often a relaxing break after reading works such as Ayn Rand's, or Upton Sinclair's. I still havn't seen the film \\"A Place in the Sun\\", so naturally the book left me at the tip of my seat in surprise and excitement. This book is worth your attention for its emotional potency, moral advocating, brilliantly written scenarios and characters with believable emotions, and much more. You should read this...."},{"rating":"1","title":"An American Tragedy was a great disappointment as I was looking forward to reading it, but it was slow and boring.","review":"I never even finished the book which is very unusual for me. It just didn't hold my attention as many times as I went back to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An American Classic","review":"Yes, the book does drag a bit (I admit almost falling asleep during some parts) but altogether, \\"An American Tragedy\\" is still one of the classic novels of literature. Besides the obvious plot, it is a story about our destinies. Dreiser shows us that after millions of years of evolution, we are still only humans, capable of devastating failure."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good deep book that at times really pulls you in.","review":"This book was very good. It was descriptive, well written, and the story itself was one that many of us could relate to. A story of somebody trying to become rich and famous but failing miserably. The only possible bad point is that it becomes tedious at times, although at other times it really speeds up. A terrific read, a terrific novel that should be read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best!","review":"Even though this book is lengthy, it is worth every hour spent reading it. The mystery is compelling and the characters are one of a kind."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites.","review":"I first read this book in high school and just re-read it now in my mid-30s. It was even better than I remember it. So well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read...","review":"I happened upon the novel in a swap bin, and realized that \\"A Place in the Sun\\" had been based on the story, so I picked it up. Compelling! Dreiser's attention to detail and ability to really place you in the mind of the characters is wonderful. I've read and reread it almost as much as Gone With the Wind. It even inspired me to read actual accounts of Chester Gillette, on whom Clyde is loosely based. The characters are real, and the feel for historical detail and everyday life is so enjoyable. Truly a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The great American novel","review":"I first read this novel in a high school literature class, and it immediately became one of my all-time favorite books.In a nutshell: the main character, Clyde, seems to be a relatively decent person, but once his moral fiber is tested, it fails! Miserably! He just wants to be loved...but it has to be by the right social group. Hence the tragedy. Dreiser is an absolute genius, and this is probably his greatest novel. Everyone in America should read this book, and remember that selfishness and heartlessness will get you nowhere, at least nowhere you would really want to be. Highly recommended-I just cannot stress how amazing this book is. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Painful, but touching","review":"Not an easy reading, definitely. The more I read, the more of Griffiths' features I found in myself which of course was a painful experience. This lust for wealth and recognition, a habit of blaming everyone except oneself are unfortunately common traits of human beings. Like a surgeuon cutting your skin to cure your innards, Dreiser shows you these."},{"rating":"1","title":"An American Classic","review":"My college roommate, the best-read person I know, recommended this to me recently as the \\"best American novel ever written.\\" While it is not without its faults - overlong, repetitious in sections, and too full of religious hokum - it has certainly found a place on my own list of Greatest Ten American Novels. Its ability to create a sense of personal suffocation, its depiction of the price that both social conservatism and the American dream of upward advancement exact on the young is unsurpassed. It may seem dated stylistically, but thematically it still resonates. If you haven't read this novel yet, do."},{"rating":"1","title":"yellowed and musty, not new","review":"I have ordered many used and new books from Amazon.

I would not order another book from Alibris."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take The Time to Read This Classic","review":"Loved this book but it is very long. I thought about the length of this book and how I would shorten it but couldn't bear to see anything cut.This book was the subject of a movie by the same name in 1931 starring Sylvia Sidney as \\"Bert\\" and Phillips Holmes as Clyde. I have yet to see this movie but I have read that it stays closer to the original novel than 1951 remake titled \\"A Place In The Sun\\" starring Montgomery Clift as Clyde, Elizabeth Taylor as Angela Vickers and Shelly Winters in the role of \\"Bert\\" renamed for this movie Alice Tripp. Montgomery Clift was born to play the part of Clyde, renamed in this version George Eastman, one cannot imagine anyone else in the role. Elizabeth Taylor is beautiful and her portrayal of Angela (Sondra Finchley)is compassionate and convincing. However, I found Shelly Winters portral of the Bert character tiresome and heavy handed.A Place In The Sun departs greatly from the book but is still a Hollywood classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reading for assignment","review":"I read An American Tragedy only because it was assigned to me from my english teacher. Of COURSE the length of it made me a bit uneasy, but after a chapter or two, I was completely hooked. This might be one of my favorite books! Now that I'm a few years older, I read this book once a year just to refresh my memory of why I loved it so much. It's definately a book you'll read again and again. 5 stars all the way :}"},{"rating":"2","title":"I learnt other things from this book as well","review":"it was an excellent book. reading it was like savoring a rich fudge sundee for dessert (being 800 pages and all). it was an excellent look at the real world. i like the way dreiser builds up the characters, no matter how big or small their part in the story is because doing this enables the reader to understand why a certain character is acting a certain way. this book has many messages besides the typical poor boy seeks $$$ and ultimately commits murder: parents should be more attentive to their children, they should give them some breathing roomone should have a reason for beleiving in something, not just because. like esta had superficaly religious beliefs, which is why she was in trouble for sometimeif you loved sister carrie you will also love this book!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle version is an insult","review":"Whitehead is a genius, and the Kindle version that I bought is an insult to him and anyone who reads.

We accepted TV delivery as the units looked intact and powered up without any problems. After connecting the TV to a DVD source, the tube however showed some discoloration in corners and along the edges. Initially I assumed that the problem would be easily corrected either by tuning the unit or by a small adjustment by SHARP technician. It is not the case, however, as now we were informed that the TV tube is damaged and need to be replaced. Amazon does not accept returns on TVs of this size, and SHARP is not eager to replace the tube under standard warranty.I would not recommend purchasing any TV unit from Amazon which is not covered by a return policy. Just as us, you might purchase a defective unit and have no recourse to fix it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenient for a rainiy day","review":"I found this case very convenient to use when traveling. I had several rainy days while in Paris and carrying my camera in this case made things much easier. It is not bulky and I knew my camera was protected from the rain. The only thing that was a little inconvenient was the straps of this jacket getting in the way of my photo. I was carrying several things with me during my trip, including an umbrella. This made a little more difficult to adjust the straps to the lens and the body of the camera whenever I wanted to take a quick photo. However, I rather dealt with that problem that expose my camera to the elements. The design would be better if it had an inside part that can be adjusted to the body of the camera and the outside part that covers the whole camera when not in use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow developing, lacks surprises","review":"I had high hopes for this book based off the reviews but after getting in about 100 pages I was still waiting for it to get interesting. It's a fairly fast read but I was left wanting more. There's no real mystery to where the story is going; the author tries to add in some drama but it really doesn't come off very well. By the end I just wanted it to be over, it just couldn't hold my attention because the story was so bland."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo, Jonathan Harr . . . . Caravaggio","review":"A wonderful entertaining read.Harr proves he can hit home runs, two in a row; the first, \\"ACivil Action,\\" and now this. The outcome, while preordained, remains exciting and rewarding from page one to the end. I sawthe painting in Dublin; it mesmerizes with its intensity and action, its chiaroscuro, capturing all that makes Caravaggio the genius he most definitely was. Add the painting to this book and the circle of appreciation and admiration is complete."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Lost Painting","review":"I can't believe that anyone could praise this sophomoric writing or manage to stay awake for more than twenty minutes trying to plow through a story which would have been better told in four paragraphs. A Civil Action was a great read and I now realize it was because Mr. Harr did not have to use his imagination and tried to use it with The Lost Painting and failed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I read the same book?","review":"I anxiously anticipated this book because I appreciate Caravaggio's art and hoped that this book was similar to the Red Violin. Unfortunately, it was a huge disappointment. As I read chapter after chapter, I kept waiting for it to get better. When I finished the book I could not believe that I wasted so much time on it. I must own a different book from that read by the other reviewers.Save your money and time."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a read!","review":"This is one book you cannot put down. When it ends it leaves you wanting more.

I have never read a book about art and art history and so thought it might be interesting but, unless you are somewhat fluent in Italian and just love wordy prose you may want to pass on this volume.Below are the things, people and places introduced within just the first ten pages:Names of people and things: Sir Denis, Signore Mahon, Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio, Roberto Longhi, Guercino, Guido Reni, Carracci, Domenichino, Doria Pamphili, Carlo Pietrangeli, Francesca Cappelletti, Giampaolo Correale & PiaggioNames of places: Da Fortunato, Cadogan Square, Archivio di Stato, Capitoline Gallery, Via del Portico d'Ottavia, Palazzo Senatorio, Bibliotheca Hertaiana, Via Gregoriana, Piazza Navona, Tita dei Monte, Villa Medici, Via Fracassini, Piazza del Popolo & Istituto Centrale per il RestauroNew names are added continually throughout the book, but if you can easily pronounce them - go for it! I got a headache."},{"rating":"1","title":"a masterpiece of disappointment","review":"Before, I order a book from Amazon, I always check the reviews written by regular readers. After having read and completely enjoyed A Civil Action, also by the author, I was encouraged to see a generally good respose to The Lost Painting. I was so disappointed. This book was actually boring and dull. I described it to a friend as a college art history text but without the pictures. I will admit that the last 70 pages or so were a bit more engrossing and read quite quickly. If you want to read a Jonathan Harr book, read A Civil Action. It was great. Then spend your money to rent the John Travolta movie on video. Don't bother buying this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"book of the year","review":"This book was better than the Da Vinci Code and this one istrue. Well written and a great storey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected more","review":"There were several flaws with this book.1) I am an amateur artist and have read quite a bit about art, and I found the book to be dull.2) More than 1/2 the book is about Francesca and Laura. They did not find the painting and the descriptions of their personal lives are not interesting.3) It would make an interesting article but it doesn't have enough meat for a book.4) The first and 2nd halves of the book were only tenuously related to each other.I kept waiting for something to happen but nothing did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been good, but it wasn't.","review":"This was a disappointment. The hunt for a lost Caravaggio, the digging about in archives, the scientific test to see \\"is it really?\\", should be fascinating. But it's not. And I cannot stand non-fiction writers who think they have to make their books read like fiction. Where is the critical analysis? Where is the index? Where are the footnotes? Non-fiction needs references. You cannot expect me to believe what you are writing unless you tell me where you got the information. A bibliography and acknowledgements don't cut it.I'm seeing this more and more in non-fiction and it drives me right up the wall.And who the heck had the idea of publishing a book about a Caravaggio painting with NO, I repeat NO, illustrations?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great story, but not much of a book","review":"As a photographer and great admirer of Michelangelo Merisi di Caravaggio's mastery of light, I was eager to plow through Jonathan Harr's book \\"The Lost Painting.\\" And to be sure, there is something here. Just maybe not enough for a book length. The core story is interesting, but the book itself isn't.Walking down cob-web stone steps by candle light is all well and good, but it feels as if Harr used over descriptive language and really stretched the word count to accommodate publication. The book needed a deeper parallel story accompanying the search for The Taking of Christ, one we don't find in this book. I think after reading the dust jacket, you'll probably get most of the story than reading the whole book.This is a great five page article for the New Yorker, but this is by no means worth the word count in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"History as mystery...","review":"Fascinating story about the diligent archival research and coincidences involved in the search for a lost masterpiece. Very well written, very well supported with historical data. Maybe a little heavy on the personal drama side, but that's what takes the \\"dry\\" out of the historical account and gives life to the research. Caravaggio is portrayed as a bit of a mystery himself, a \\"bad boy\\" artist who painted earthy images of religious characters. Almost reads like a mystery novel. The lost painting itself, the centerpiece of the story, is a moving, dramatic scene of the betrayal of Christ...will they find it?????"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Search for a Lost Masterpiece","review":"This is a page-turning account of a search for a real Caravaggio painting that has been missing for hundreds of years.The search starts in Italy with an art historian and two graduate students. It continues to other countries and the suspense builds. What is the painting's history? Who owned it last? Is it still in existence.I enjoyed this book very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully Slow","review":"The plot is about the paintstaking process researches go through to find a lost painting and the pace of this book is just as painfully slow. I finished it, but had to force myself to just keep reading. It reads like a novel, but it is a true story of researchers looking for a lost painting, the search requires, careful attention to detail, hours posting through the dead scrolls of family archives, if this sounds exciting to you, then go for it....don't be fooled by the back of the jacket or the reviews, you really don't learn anything about the artist, other than the fact his life wasn't that exciting, the lives of his researchers aren't that exciting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Art history for non-art historians.","review":"I have a only a passing interest in art, but I really enjoyed this book. It comes across a real-life (thus highly toned-down) DaVinci Code. Harr tells the story almost as if it were fictional, and there are enough basement searches through historic family archives of former Italian aristocracy and restoration near-disasters to support his approach.Occasionally Harr takes things a bit further than they should probably go in a non-fictional book; our protagonist's wedding flirtation that isn't even relevant to her romantic life which, in turn isn't relevant to the story is downright inexplicable. In the end, Harr's detours don't really take away from an engaging true stry that he's done a nice job of recounting in a page-turning manner.Recommended for anyone with even a passing interest in art of art history."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lost Painting - By Jonathan Harr","review":"I have not completed this book yet, BUT it is very well written and holds my interest. Harr is a very detailed writer whose book, A Civil Action, detailed the court case of the families whose children were dying of cancer caused by pollution from WR Grace in Woborn MA. Harr captures his readers by carefully discribing every pertinant detail and is able to keep his readers interest. Read his books. Although different topics both will keep you wanting to know what is next to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aaahh, disappointing....","review":"I have been interested in htis story since the early 90s when I read about it in an article in the NYTimes...I was thrilled to see a book on such a fascinating subject...so, you can imagine my disappointment at this boring, un-inspirational book, on a topic so full of potential. for a tome that refers constantly to the \\"obsession\\" that so many scholars and historiains have for Caravaggio, the book is dull, clumsy and bereft of either passion or obsession. I found the characters conveniently drawn, two dimensional and in general, forgettable.

I've sent this as gifts to some art history buff friends, but a general readership would like it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some naming consistency, please?","review":"It's a very well-written and gripping story, even though it's scarcely a mystery in the conventional sense of the term. At the risk of nitpicking, I have to say that the author's references to character names bothered me. He always refers to the two main female characters by their first names (Francesca and Laura), while with a couple of minor exceptions all male characters get last-name treatment (Benedetti, Mahon, Keaveney, etc.) It dehumanizes the men, turning them into faceless automatons even while the women are made into fully rounded, human characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"LITE Christian idea book","review":"I bought this book, despite the negative reviews, and I was disappointed.

The illegal US bombing of Cambodia killed another 500,000 people, and an additional three million people died at the hands of the Khmer Rouge, who were supplied and supported by the US government.Yet all the Ameicans ever talk about or care about are the 57,000 US troops that died in Viet Nam. The US troops were the aggressors in Viet Nam, and they were carrying out genocide against the Viet Namese people. I never felt any sympathy for the US troops at all, and I do not respect those who do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"My review will be of little use to you, as I cannot tell you why I disliked the book so much, except that I had to force myself to read two-thirds of it, and had to stop because it was boring. There were a few clever bits in these tales, but it was not enough for me. I think I understood most or all of it, but it was just not interesting enough. Of course I did not expect it to be a page turner like a Tom Wolfe novel, I understand some books are trickier to read but are worth the trouble. This was not such a book, the good bits were not enough to carry the whole book.I really enjoyed \\"Out of Africa\\", and enjoyed \\"Babette's Feast\\" and thought I would like seven Gothic Tales, alas I did not.I think this book is one that you will either like or dislike, in the same way people like or dislike Shakespeare."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is PEPPER","review":"You know those bland market peppers, or the \\"fresh\\" pepper grinder pepper??

The logic and moral power of Garrison, and the anti-slavery people of the country and the army, have done all.�?Henry Mayer's All on Fire captures Garrison, and the logic and moral power he gave to his country, as no other work has. It is one of the great American biographies of one of the greatest Americans: psychologically acute; sympathetic but open-eyed about its subject; deeply knowledgeable about the times it chronicles; keenly analytical; gracefully and powerfully written. For anyone who cares about American history, the place of religion in public life, and the role of the agitator in democratic politics, it is a book worth pondering and savoring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and uplifting","review":"This book gives one great insight into a very turbulent past and great hope for the future.

I would have given it 5 stars if it had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lot's of fun but don't expect it to last long","review":"I bought this for my daughter. She loves to play with it. But we were disappointed by a couple of things. As we started to brush their hair- wads of hair came out. It tangles easily and is hard to manage but she still enjoys it. Also her other disappointment was the hair color. Although it comes in more than one color, you can't tell the difference between them in the hair. Really, it barely even shimmers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"These styling heads are such a waste of money. I bought this for my two girls for Christmas. They've only played with these once so far and have not asked for them again. I'm 40 years old and used to have one of these Barbie heads when I was a young girl. They have not improved them at all in the last 30 years. The hair came tangled out of the box and when I brushed the hair, it fell out everywhere. SAVE YOUR MONEY - NOT WORTH THE $45 THAT I PAID."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this toy","review":"This is one of the worst toys I have ever purchased. There is absolutely NO way to brush or comb the hair -- it is too tangled and untangling it only causes it to fall out. In addition, both heads are attached to the box with a plastic 'tag holder' that comes out of each head -- it is absolutely impossible to remove this holder and there is no choice but to cut it, leaving a sharp end which could easily hurt a child. What a giant rip-off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I can't believe this thing has such high reviews.... because of that, I added it to my wishlist for Christmas for my 2 girls, thinking it was perfect with the 2 styling heads. I just saw the review that it does not have makeup, which was a major disappointment as well... Other than that, after you have added the gel and styled it, you are finished. The hair is tangled and the gel is a mess. It is very expensive for such a small amount of fun (if any). I can't believe it has such high reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two are better than one!","review":"My five year old really likes this set.

Excellent BUY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good leather but not so good case","review":"This leather case isn't bad but a lot bulkier than it looks in the picture. Also, the way to open and shut it is very inconvenient. Instead of using a snap or velcro which would have been better, you have to slide the flap through a little leather ring. Not only does it feel awkward and take too much time to open and close, but it looks as though the ring could easily break over time. Had I first seen this in the store, I would not have bought it. That being said, the leather is good quality and if you don't mind spending extra time to get it opened and closed, its not a bad product."},{"rating":"1","title":"iConcepts case not at all as it was advertised","review":"Ordered this for my Palm V, and it came very quickly--as usual; nice job, Amazon!!!BUT, this case was NOT as advertised...the one shipped was nothing like it was pictured...no leather sleeve to put the PDA into; just a stylus-type connector that was supposed to slide into the left stylus holder. Fine, except the stylus connector was way too small for my Palm. Had to send it back.Again, not Amazon's fault---they are wonderful to work with, as usual!!I won't buy anything from iConcepts again, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"The funniest thing I have ever read about health.","review":"The writer must have spent some time in a hospital because she has a wonderful insight.

From the chapter on surgery, this is a snippet of her humor: \\"Postoperative Activities: Walking. As soon as you've stopped throwing up, they will get you out of bed and make you walk.

I didn't quite grasp how to use the trigrams in this book though.The book gives about five pages talking about each room, then gives a page of brief tips to get you started.Some of the tips seem so obvious, that you wonder what all the hype is about. It does make you take a new look at your surroundings and creates a desire to improve on it.It was useful to me and is a book that I'll sample now and then to give me a fresh perspective on a room and its layout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Book - Dont waste your time or money","review":"I am an architect and certified Feng Shui specialist. This book is horrible. It recklessly confuses true Feng Shui with superstition. Please, using bagua mirrors to shield away the bad feng shui? Are you kidding me? The author even calls them pa-kua mirrors... This is the worst rendition of a feng shui book I have ever read. Give me a break, the author's other books are on \\"psychic subjects\\".Dont waste your money on this trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not Feng Shui","review":"Don't waste your time or money on this book.It is badly written, contradicts itself constantly, and the writter is obviously not an expert on the subject.It is pure bull aimed for those looking for New Age solutions.If you really want to learn about Feng Shui, read A master course in Feng Shui by Eva Wong. Be ready to do some study and hard thinking, but it is worth it. You'll realize that most of the books you've read on the subject are just based on the fact that we want to better our lives and fortunes and will practicaly do anything to achieve it. Don't let others get rich on behalf of your unkowledge. Research before you believe. Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"webster is capitalizing off eastern beliefs","review":"this book was a joke. the only thing webster clearly showed was that he knows how to make money off of other's ideas and beliefs. this book could have easily been condensed into a list of 101 lines, rather than a whole book- as all webster did was take the list and expand on it by writing the same things over and over. had i known before i bought this book that webster has written a myriad of books on feng shui, palmistry, etc. i never would have bought it. for him it is obviously quantity and not quality- not to mention webster does not site his sources."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great brush for a quick clean up","review":"I bought this brush because I wanted something that would not scratch my porcelain coated grates.

In the beginning of the movie it warns you that there are some blinking lights that may cause seizures, they weren't lying. I gave the movie away to a friend to mine, he couldn't get into it either.

It's actually much better than Herbie's own follow-up LP, Thrust. The 1st track, God Made Me Funky, is everything the title promises, with a really great, greasy guitar riff (by Blackbird McKnight) holding it all together. One of the very best jazz-funk cuts of all time. The first & last tracks have vocals, the other 4 are all instrumentals.Most of these tracks would have fit very comfortably in Herbie's Headhunters LP. One or two are not quite as interesting as the rest, but the highlights (including the aforementioned God Made Me Funky, Daffy's Dance & If You've Got It, You'll Get It) are way worth the price. The sound quality is first class.If you've been disappointed by more recent Headhunters releases, join the club. This one is the real thing -- accept no substitutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Survival Of The Fittest","review":"This album was one of the first albums in my record collection.The more I listen to this album the more I appreciate it.I am a big fan of what Herbie Hancock was doing at this time,and this is definitely his band minus him.I will admit that this album had to grow on me.I was just getting into Pure Fusion at this time and this album is very deep."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is keen!!!","review":"I've read a few books on Aztecs and this one is somewhat unique in that in addition to using textual sources, it gives a good deal of focus to the archaeolgical record as well. This perspective gives a fuller view of Aztec society as a whole, and illuminates the lives of commoners as well as those of nobles. This perspective, along with Smith's expertly and well written explanation of the Archaeology behind this perspective is fascinating. That is why this book is so keen. Also the pics are pretty nifty as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a book","review":"I mean how do you rate a textbook. This book is a scholarly book and has been cited by professors.

You can quickly and easily organize all your medical records. The way this book is set up make it really simple to do.

The crabs are having no problem eating from it!

I would have liked to have seen the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) included, and discussion of tests of function such as the Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD)without which a cognitive assessment is incomplete. I personally feel that the usual frontal lobe tests do not translate into useful clinical concepts in the way that DAD exposes issues in frontal lobe executive function and explains the disability that is a critical feature of a dementing illness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Good as Strub or Hodges.","review":"For example, Shulman does not provide any norms for the FAS-Test (a test of verbal fluency) even though it provides lengthy instructions about how to do it.The Mental Status Examination in NeurologyandCognitive Assessment for Cliniciansboth provide norms for this test.Neither Shulman norThe Mental Status Examination in Neurologyprovide the acutal test for the Trail Making Test, butCognitive Assessment for Cliniciansdoes. My own recollection is thatThe Mental Status Examination in NeurologyandCognitive Assessment for Clinicianscomplemented each other well when I read them both and cobbled together my own, prefered cognitive test battery and data for interpreting the results of it. Together, the other two books are about the same cost as Shulman. I myself would buyCognitive Assessment for Cliniciansand then go from there."},{"rating":"2","title":"good reference","review":"It's not the most complete reference in neurology, but it's objective, go straight to the point, suitable clinical information.

The style is verbose, and there is no way to differentiate what is mandatory to know from what is advisable to know to what is impermissible not to know. Because of this poor design, it is almost useless unless you already know the topic pretty well.If you are specializing in the topic, buy it.

(the first part of this book went to print during the Civil War). R.L.Dabney served for a time with Jackson and was asked by Mrs Jackson to write this book. It is, as I suppose it is to be expected, a bit biased in Jackson's favor and the \\"speak\\" takes a little getting used to since it was written over one hundred years ago, however this lends this book an air of authenticity. I found the use of Jackson's letters to his wife very informative as they reveal his strength of character and his true devotion to his religion and to the Southern cause as he perceived it. Overall I found this an inspirational book that only served to deepen my already profound respect for this great hero."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do it....","review":"I don't like this case.

I've seen 6 different Les Mis casts, and Stig Rossen (London cast, June 1997) was the best Jean Valjean I've seen by far. I bought this CD solely based on the fact that I was blown away by his voice when I saw him in Les Mis. You'll love the other songs on this CD just because his voice is so good.P.S.

The music is written in completely nonstandard notation, which isn't well explained: about a paragraph of explanation is given about how to read the music, but otherwise you're left to figure it out for yourself. Learning to play from this notation, which is unlike any other published autoharp music I've seen, won't help you at all when you try to read and play anything else.Overall, while this method may work, I recommend against it for its lack of correlation to available sheet music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the most in depth book","review":"I did not like this book at all. It was really hard to follow and was not very well explained or detailed enough in order to adequately play the instrument. This is especially true if the reader has had no previous experience with the autoharp. It gives the very basics to strumming and the barest basics to picking melodies. The author does not even include any musical notation. The CD that came with the book was not instructional, it was simply the author singing the songs. I would recommend \\"Beginning Autoharp Instruction Book\\" by Bonnie Phipps. This is a much clearer method to follow and I was much more successful with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"very poor beginner's book.","review":"This book is very poor instruction for a beginner it assumes you know how to read music and the cd is WAAAAAY to fast for a beginner to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heaven on Earth","review":"This is one of the most beautiful places on earth, and we are fortunate to have it as a National Park.

Suddenly the market, became real people. Annual Reports become chapters in an ongoing historical novel.Is it oriented to Morningstar?

There are several tales I had awareness of but had never read and only one or two that I had never heard of before. This is not a repeat read for me, but I am glad I got to catch up on all these stories that I missed out on in childhood.A fun collection overall. I particularly enjoyed the \\"Arabian Nights\\" section, since those were completely new to me.

It's not fair that from an offering of 4 products I finally used just two of them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We love this playard","review":"We bought this playard as a spare bed for grandma's. It is so easy to set up and take down. As a former nanny I have seen many pack and plays and this one is so easy. The change table could be a little higher. I have to bend over quite a bit to change her. However, I'm 5'9\\". My baby loves the sounds that play especially the heartbeat and goodnight lullabies. The night light is handy for checking on her at night. I love that the volume is adjustable and the music shuts off after awhile, not too quickly though. We actually brought the sound system home and attached it to her bassinet. Graco's sound is built in to there pack and play. Like I said we love it and our baby does too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Guide to Love and Dating","review":"This book is one of the best I have read - whether secular or spiritual - on relationships and intimacy. Shmuley incorporates humor into topics that are intimate and touch the soul. For those who are believers, this book really helps to focus on the analogy between our relationship with God, and our relationship with our soulmate. The principles of primacy, exclusivity, confidence, sacred moments, grtitude, compliments, mystery, sincerity, trust and contentment are simple, but often neglected. His countering of the prevailing notion of finding a \\"partner\\" vs. a \\"soul-mate\\" is one of the most salient points in the book. As he points out, a marriage should be a union like no other, and finding someone who can be a companion spiritually, mentally, emotionally and physically is a pursuit worthy of our focus, care and attention. One to keep by the bedside, and read in between dates!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Something of value even for \\"non daters\\"","review":"I picked this book up only because of the odd juxtaposition of the two concepts in the title. It has many good tips for guiding you towards more fulfilling relationships in general, not just with your \\"date.\\" It made me appreciate and see the commandments in a whole new way. I concur with the other reviewer that there is too much schtick in the book. I enjoyed the some of the humor, and it did make certain points hit home. However after a while it got repetetive and distracting. If you can ignore the irrelevant jokes, you can find some real gems of spiritual advice for guiding your life based on the big 10. I would especially recommend this book to a guy who is looking for a meaningful relationship with a woman, perhaps leading to marriage. This answers the question, \\"What do women want?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Secrets if the 10 Commandments","review":"Although Boteach tends to create lengthy stories full of hyperbole, Boteach offers the best advice I've heard about what to look for in a soulmate. I've flipped through other dating books before and they are all about manipulation or charm. I really enjoyed learning Boteach's point of view. As a non-Jew, it has never occurred to me that the ten commandments could be applied to anything other than what they are in and of themselves. I feel that dating sermons are popular in churches because pastors want to teach the youth, who are often unsure of themselves. The advice I have have gotten growing up in church has not been helpful compared to this interpretation of dating. I bought this book based on past reviews and would recommend it to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiresome","review":"This book tries to connect the ten commandments to dating and is not too successful as the connection is very loose. This is one of those books that are way too long (about 300 pages), but mostly because it is repetitious and somewhat preachy annoying probably since it is written by a Rabbi. It is also very righteous, maybe too righteous (is that possible?) also because it is written by a religious person. It started out ok but grew very tiresome at the end that I cannot wait for it to finish. The grammar is bad, very bad. I give it a few stars though because it did had some good content that you can use for dates but having to filter those useful tidbits from 300 pages is no fun at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Muscle Ballet\\"? Hardly.","review":"This video uses very little ballet - Stephanie Herman doesn't even wear ballet shoes, she wears aerobic shoes. She stands in a corner and bounces around to what looks like a very un-choreographed routine. I was looking for a difficult workout (because ballet when done correctly is difficult) but I didn't even break a sweat. Try Ballet Workout II, also by Kultur, which uses barre, center, and floor work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long and Lean","review":"I bought this video because I needed something to get me started with an exercise program. I love watching ballet, but I am not a dancer, so I was, at first, wary. However, Herman's workout is gentle on the body while at the same time, demanding. Great combination. Herman's also very personable and encouraging. I use the video every night and I've noticed my middle aged stiffness has disappeared and I have much more energy. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Muscle Ballet","review":"This VHS is great! I was expecting ballet moves like in a more studio setting. But this tape bring so much more to the table. The instructor targets the core parts of the body in order to do the excercises. The music is great, and the works out are not long and tedious. After about an hour work out, my body and stomach area feels tighter and more relaxed."},{"rating":"1","title":"S.

As a result, the reader with a strong background in this history will not find much new. However, the book is extremely well-written and very accessible--I read it in two sittings, and my 12-year-old brother has just started it.In addition to effective writing, Gilbert includes some chilling photographs and reproductions of other primary sources. Especially disturbing are German documents cold-bloodedly noting that so many Jews arrived at such-and-such a camp, of whom X were killed immediately, and Y put to work.Parents who believe their children are of an appropriate age might consider reading this book together as a way of introducing the most important, and most horrific, crime of this century. It is important."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock-solid CD guaranteed to make you move!","review":"If this CD doesn't make you shake your money-maker, then you just might be comatose.

While the product description clearly shows Fuji HQ, what I got was just plain old Fujicolor; not the same film at all. That kinda sucks. And from reading other reviews here, that seems to be the way they roll.Now, to keep things in perspective, it's not the end of the world. Rather than go through the hassle of returning the film (which after all was only about $8), I'm going to try it out. How bad could it be? I know Fuji makes good film in general. And the other good thing was that the film was well within its expiration date (my film was dated 2014, plenty of time to go), unlike some vendors who ship outdated film.But really, guys, if you show HQ, you ought to ship HQ, or change your description to match what you actually send. Otherwise, this is a deceptive sales practice.

There are no \\"loops\\" under the roof as the assembly instructions direct you to for the stabilizer tube (which doesn't stabilize). The \\"loops\\" are actually a narrow tube sewed in the TOP of the roof. Folding is nearly impossible.

She would play in it for hours if we let her (that is the reson for the 3 stars for fun) Long story short, the first night that she slepted in it, it colapsed on her while she was sleeping. Her head and face were completly covered. The sleeping bag, we kept.

She will be 6 this march, and she still plays with Annabell all the time. I am very impressed with all she does, and the realistic play that my daughter has with her. As your daughter feeds her a bottle, it feels very realistic, and also sounds realistic....with the sucking sounds and movements, and right afterwards if you put her on your shoulder she burps! My daughter loves this, because it's so life like. The coos and sounds she makes are precious. My daughter plays with her for hours, and takes her everywhere.

And she's the right size for standard newborn clothes & diapers, which are much cheaper than her (IMO) ridiculously overpriced accessory line. The sucking is really realistic, and the interactive features- her response to noise & motion is lots of fun too. On the other hand, I was disappointed in her body having a large, flat square of hard plastic inside, making her kind of uncuddly, and her sucking & blinking are accompaned by a rather loud mechanical whirring sound that's hard to ignore...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Precious!","review":"We just bought this for my daughters 3rd birthday. The doll is a little heavy which just adds to her life like look, but super precious! She can be loud just like a real baby so I find it necessary to turn her off when we are shopping.

(Remember the dolls of a few years ago that would GROW?? Ee-yikes.)

The Video, well I need to replace that......it is very good, and I am not surprised it got a five star, from others. I have always enjoyed Babs and she never seems to let us down. My favorite part of 'The Concert Video' is when she does the psychatrist scenes. She is hilarious when she states: 'Have I ever seen a psychatrist? ' Slapstic Streisand....performs well. My favorite song is from Yentil. She does such a good blend with her alter voice in the screen video version. The blend is very well done. I have shown this video to anyone that wants to watch it. It is a favorite at my parties. People want to see it over, and over again.

The lightheartedness and the positive attitude expressed in the book seemed to take the weight off my shoulders.After being called in to see the doctor, he informed me that last week's biopsy results required more cutting.However the anxiety usually attached to such news was lessened due to reading just a few chapters. I really took the book with me to cut the waiting room boredom, and it turned out that I brought a friend to the doctor's office.

By doing these exercises I'm apparently releasing feel good endorphins into my body. I really don't care how it works-- I have so much more confidence now.

Although his music has often been described as \\"anxious\\" and \\"abstract\\", there is a sweet sensitivity to the lyracism and harmony of this set which is both powerful and unyielding.The beauty of Coltrane's Lush Life is in it's musical diversity.

It's an obvious must-have for the jazz enthusiast who has an ear for the avant-garde."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good look at a speeding Trane...","review":"Considered one of Coltrane's 'searching' periods, this CD has a lot to offer in the way of understanding Trane's restless nature. Never one to stand on laurels, Coltrane does indeed continue to set the bar 'higher' every time out. This one is mostly ballad and blues based, with the exeption of 2 tracks in particular which stand out - on both ends of the Trane spectrum. Track #2, \\"I Love You\\" finds him playing furious, cerebral runs on the instrument, and , frankly, not as 'listenable' as one may like; whereas the track with Donald Byrd is as 'in the pocket' as you'll ever hear. All in all, a very realistic look at a genius in motion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blacks out after 15 months","review":"I purchased a computer package that included the hp vs15 15\\" monitor.

My husband raves about the excellent job the sweeper does and how much it has reduced the time cleaning up the leaves. Assembly was a breeze.

For Electrical Engineers I suspect what you have in your \\"High Speed Digital Design\\" (Johnson and Graham) will be more than adequate.The real issue is simply too much information. I agree with Ott that some understanding of antennas is needed to understand EMC but not nearly the amount covered in this book.

They are of very different values, although they are family. That was the only vaguely interesting part of the book. I found the story fairly implausible and did not make a very compelling argument as to why Aisha was with her white fiance in the first place. Then she meets this other black guys and falls in love at first sight. I usually find Little to be a decent AA author, but this left much to be desired. I was turned off after the first chapter.

I also thought the writing got sloppy at the very end (timing issues, voice discrepancies).... That being said, it also left me kind of angry with it long after I finished reading it.

Cazenove's reading is fine, but the plot is so intricate and so subtle that it's nearly impossible to follow unless given the utmost attention. The plot progresses by changes in the attitudes and reactions of the characters which are too nuanced to come through one man's voice effectively.

It seems that James never met a comma he didn't like, and uses them to imbed all sorts or modifiers and asides. Although the graduate students may attach some deeper meaning to this, I suspect he really didn't have a clear idea of anything he wanted to say so he simply rambled on. At least with Faulkner there is a payoff. With James, all the language covolutions lead to nothing in the way of action. Random House must have had a large,unsold inventory of this book ( not surprising) so they included it in their top 100 list.

Where the desktop is some machine affordable to the average audiophile. He talks about the assembling of hardware and software, to make a system you'll be proud of. There is an emphasis on getting the most for your money. Cheaper and better, as one chapter's title succinctly puts it.Throughout the book, he puts links to recommended companies. And advice about common parts, like microphones. Ideally, there is enough advice in the book for you to construct an entire recording studio in your home. And to be able to record and make a CD of your local bands.The book concludes with a good summary of p2p issues in the music world. Something that you should be acutely aware of, if you intend to build not just a recording studio, but also to put out your own label. After all, if you're doing the former, isn't the latter always implied, at least as a possibility?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much filler","review":"I am just getting into the home recording game and was looking for some texts to get started.

There are literally hundreds of \\"Hot Links\\" with half page screen shots of the associated site scattered throughout-every other page at least. I would say that easily a third of the material in this book is these links and screen shots, and they are injected between the sections of text in such a way that it seriously impairs the flow of the material. There are some great tidbits of information and insights, but the mass of \\"Hot Link\\" filler makes it hard to recommend buying this.

Dwelly's dictionary is a massive tome, possibly including just about every Gaelic word in existence at the time. The place and family names reference in the back is also quite interesting.That having been said, this dictionary is outdated in a lot of ways. It uses the old orthography with acute accents and lots of apostrophes in odd places. Also, it lacks an English-Gaelic section, which reduces the value-for-price ratio for the Gaelic learner, who is often attempting to translate his English thoughts into Gaelic. In my view, all a learner needs is Owen's \\"Modern Gaelic to English Dictionary\\" and Thomson's \\"New English to Gaelic Dictionary.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"still a definitive resource","review":"Although it is a fairly old dictionary, it remains one of the three most valuable reference dictionaries for the Gaelic language.

Not just lyrically, but the science of music that they use. They use tones, melody, harmony and everything in-between to create a sense of euphoria in your brain.

Asterix and Co. to the rescue!This was the first post-Goscinny Asterix adventure, and there has been a great deal of controversy over the years. Personally, I enjoyed it; yes, the politics are a bit closer to the surface than I'd like to see, but Uderzo is flinging brickbats at everyone, at least. Crossing Romeo and Juliet with the Lord of the Rings is wonderfully amusing, as well. Uderzo went back closer to the spirit of the original series after this, but I have to say, this was an interesting glimpse at what could have been. ***"},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat dissapointing","review":"First published in French in 1980 as \`Le Grand Fosse', this album was first published in English in 1981.Chief Cleverdix sends his son Histrionix to the village by the sea, to call on the aid of Chief Vitalstatistix, to settle a dispute with his rival , Chief Majestix..Asterix, Obelix and Getafix are as a result sent to the divided village.This was the first book written by Uderzo alone, and is not one of the best. Much of the humour is recycled from earlier Astérix books, and the attempts at political satire are weak, unlike the superb political satire of \`Asterix and Caesar's Gift' for example. Uderzo would later prove that he could however, write, good Asterix comics, with such gems as \`Asterix and the Black Gold' and \`Asterix and The Magic Carpet'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scandalous disappointment: Not the real Asterix","review":"It all summed up when I realised that this is the first Asterix book written after Rene Goscinny's death. Though Goscinny was only the author, anybody who's read at least a handful of Asterix books can now recognise the role he played in creating Asterix. This book is void of the real Asterix: the main villain is some creepy fish guy; there is a pseudo-romantic sub-plot; Getafix makes some more magic potions that are really weird; the Romans turn into balls and then shrink to the size of insects. The plot has only a remnant of the real Asterix stories.Gone are the days when Asterix and Obelix can make you laugh - except Asterix and the Black Gold, which is really good despite that Uderzo made it himself (it is a tribute to Goscinny)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great story, really","review":"I really appreciate Uderzo's attempt to keep the Asterix adventures going, but he really is a much better artist than he is a story author. Every single Asterix book up until Gozcinny's death is an absolute work of genius and I would very much recommend for reading. They all have plot, realistic comedy, and personality. However, Uderzo's attempt to match Gozcinny's talent at story writing has proven to be an absolute flop.To date, none of the new Asterix books, including this one, has any real adventure, plot, nor personal comical dialog which defined Asterix and his personality. Now, the books tend to move toward comical 'ridiculous' all throughout and are no where near the comical 'realistic-ness' that once define the great stories of Asterix.I wish Uderzo would hire himself a genius author to help continue the adventure and just throw away the obvious flops that have marred the stories since Goscinny's death in 1977."},{"rating":"2","title":"Confused","review":"I was perfectly satisfied with the pots - they are terra cotta plant pots, not much else to say.

It's left to us to figure out, or imagine how they got to where they are.While brave and challenging,I was sometimes frustrated that the characters never quite fully develop, occasionally feeling more sketchy and symbolic than full blooded.Early on I excitedly felt I might be watching a masterpiece.

I got the large in black. I've carried it in my pocket for months now, with absolutely no signs of wear and tear. The zipper is first rate, and you know that is not the norm with most coin purses. Hemp is super flexible and it can be folded to match the size of whatever is put into the purse. So when I have a lot to carry, it lets me with no questions. And when my coinage has lost its turgidity, I just fold it up like a hankie, and it works that way, too. I even carry a mini-Leatherman tool in it with no rips or tears. If you've ever wanted a light, versatile, strong, and dependable coin purse, this is definitely it. Hands down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"an important novel","review":"This is a truly extraordinary novel. It demands a certain amount of quiet to be read well.

The battery is charged, the horn works, the brake releases, but the unit is apparently defective and will not budge. Aside from that, the stickers are all curling off either from poor design - they don't fit well - or a poor adhesive. The box was in fine condition when it arrived so I chalk all these problems up to really bad QA out the door.

If the ending had not been so surprising I would have given this book only one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow","review":"The \\"German\\" in this book was so stereotyped and shallow to one who is familiar with the true culture and history of the German people. This book perpetuates many myths and does the truth a disservice. Too bad another culture could not have been the backdrop -- but that would do another country a disservice as well. For those wishing a plot, not totally credible, this is the book for you. Don't believe the attitudes of the characters, however. They ring false. By reading this on a shallow level, a reader may be amused and entertained. A lot of grains of salt have to be consumed in reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow & Insipid","review":"What a disappointment. The characters are shallow, the prose too flowery and unbelievable, and the story factually inaccurate. For example, after Eve returns to college after her first semester, she thinks that it had been a wonderful Christmas. Her parents weren't Christians, they were Jews who lost their parents in the Holocaust. Moreover, the author glossed over such important events like the death of Joel's and Caroline's parents that it didn't really seem to matter to the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uplifting story in spite of its graphic sorrow","review":"This is an excellent example of modern literature of quality. Rosner's language is rich and her approach is creative. The story achieves balance with its three narrators and their stories. I don't want to give away too much, but some very sad stories are revealed and dealt with in a believable way. The character growth is not miraculous but true. It is difficult to find a story that is both sorrowful and uplifting at the same time. I wish I could find more. This was an excellent book for discussion in our book club. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-Centered Attempt to be Different","review":"Rosner attempt to come up with an original idea in a literary world full of ideas that have been done to death. while she succeeds in the originality respect it is like that is all the book is about, how it changes from one pov without annotation and fanfare. beyond that idea the book is only a potpourri of ideas that made other books great, nightmares of the holocaust, ptsd/survivors guilt, political genocide in latin america, a singers quest and corruption in the music world across europe, and an autistic person. all together it is stupid, useless, and a self-centered attempt to become great and famous on the authors part. it depresses me i wasted time on this novel, i would have stopped and burned the book by page 2, but alas it was for school, and i feel i have to add i've enjoyed every other book i've read in school. this is the first book that i have EVER wanted to destroy to prevent another poor soul from suffering through it.

The writing is so lovely and so poetic, that irrespective of your inclination toward prose or poetry, you cannot help but be moved by the language of the book. Also, the manner in which the writer presents the points of view of the three main characters is so perfectly executed that she makes a difficult style choice appear simple.

I might add that the package, which had been opened, was labled OTC 6496 but the tool inside was not.I did not have luxury of time to send it back because I needed to use the tool immediately.If you are considering purchasing this puller, be sure the seller will actually send the one you pay for and not some cheap version.I think I will stick with Ebay and actual online retailers-not some Amazon subcontracted seller.Good tool but getting ripped off really sticks in my craw."},{"rating":"1","title":"COMPLETE FRAUD","review":"As noted by another reviewer, the item sent is NOT OTC 6496.

The heroine is reduced to background furniture; the snobby rich girl becomes a sympathetic female lead! They added in a romance that wasn't in the book and the ending was completely changed. Nothing really memorable in the way of acting, setting, or music, though none of these were particularly bad.

He plods around the beginning of the movie and dies at the end, and is otherwise less actively involved than a guest appearance by Batman.There are slowly paced movies that unravel characters and plots with grace, then there are turgidly paced movies with deliberately lingering shots that could put a hurricane to sleep. As I droned through this film, I wondered if there was anyone one earth who actually enjoyed it without confusing it with a dull night's sleep. One can't help sympathize with the female lead, hate the male lead (who really really really isn't Rufus Sewell) and wonder whether the plot was left on the cutting room floor. This may have been adapted from a very good book which I haven't read; having watched this thick pudding, I'd rather reread Harry Potter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Woodlanders not worth the money","review":"I primarily got this video based on the actors, especially Rufus Sewell, and the review of the movie itself.

If you want fun and great Pan music try Bakra Bata's CD \\"Steel Drums and Percussion\\" It's fun and is some of the best Pan music you will hear anywhere. At times when listening to music you just know the people love what they are doing and are having fun, I just don't get that feeling in Panyard Vibrations.

Underwater the pictures were good on a rainy day, focus was ok. To get better pictures get an underwater case for your digital camera. For it's ease of use and being disposable, I recommend this! I checked out the reviews of the other camera's out there and this is a clear leader. It has a large rubber band to help keep the unit at hand.

Almost no pictures turned out and nearly all were shot at less than ten feet from the subjects. The turtles were almost in front of our faces. The ones we could use require extensive work with PhotoShop in order to even make them out. The couple we took from the deck of the boat were fine.

I used the camera while snorkeling in Cancun, and only three photos even produced images. And those images weren't good. The first place I went, the water wasn't super clear, but the photos were worse than I expected -- negatives show slide after slide of nothing. The next place we went snorkeling was a cenote -- a limestone cave. The cave was extremely dark and required flashlights part of the time. Not surprisingly, none of those photos came out. If you are snorkeling only in pristine water with perfect visibility, then maybe you will get some shots, but otherwise I'd say don't even bother bringing this camera with you. The viewfinder is tiny, and if you are wearing a snorkel mask, as I was, you won't be able to really see what you're aiming at anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waterproof camera that's not waterproof!","review":"We purchased a pair of these cameras for a recent cruise to the Caribbean.

I used a hair scrunchy and put my arm through it so it wouldn't fall, but it ripped. So make sure you think of how you'll secure it to your wrist because it does have the place for such things. I paid about $8 and got the pictures on a CD. If you plan on always using one I'd recommend buying a waterproof camera since you'll end up paying about $20 for 27 pictures.

Any pictures taken underwater with this camera should be extremely close range, no more than a couple feet away, and the water has to be very clear and extremely well lit. The pictures will be a bit grainy and fuzzy. Which is to be expected to a certain degree. The best purpose for this camera is taking pictures in the water, but not necessarily under the water except under ideal conditions. I wasn't too happy with this one, might be worth the extra cash to get one with flash on it, becaues at the end of the day when only a few pictures turn out, it's not really worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Film","review":"I purchased this camera to take to the Grand Cayman Island.

The plastic housing clouded in the heat, ~94 Fahrenheit (34 Celsius) at maximum. I had to punch out the plastic housing in the lens area with a leatherman tool to make it workable but still couldn't see through the viewfinder. Then it wasn't waterproof!!. We took six along for a weeklong trek and all suffered the same fate. Others on our trip with this model Fuji had the same problem so it wasn't an isolated batch problem. People using a couple of Kodak waterproof models had no problems. The Fuji had no problems in cooler conditions but then again, Fuji engineers should take all conditions into consideration when making such a camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"good for cloudy pics and dim colors","review":"my wife and i bought 3 of these cameras for our trip to St Maarten. the ones we took above water for the most part came out fine (as expected with any camera) but the underwater pics were cloudy and didnt pick up the colors of the fish/sea life we photographed.

We had done so for last year's snorkelling trip to Maui with moderate success. This year's purchase of these cameras was a different story. Upon our return, I took them to our local durgstore for processing. When I went to pick them up, the clerk said that I may want to look at them because I dont have to pay for any prints I dont want. They were awful. Dark, blurry if you could see anything at all. I should have looked at the expiration date before I used them, because these cameras were obviously defective or expired.I asked for a refund via Amaszon's refund process, and never heard anything.

However for a cheap one-use camera, it is ok. Try to avoid any sun tanning lotion on the camera lense; otherwise, it will fog.

Next time I'll buy waterproof housing for one of my digital cameras. These are horribly grainy. All the tricks I've tried to remove the grain leaves a very soft image. All the glorious details of the reef are lost. The only good images are those take above water or right at the surface, but they still have a vintage toy camera look, which is fine if you want ethereal, impressionistic images. Don't buy this thinking you'll capture the wonder of a coral reef."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't waterproof","review":"Purchased this camera for the waterpark. The first picture was crystal clear and then the remaining pictures were all cloudy and some were barely visable.

I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!","review":"Finally, a throwaway camera that CAN be used for SCUBA diving. 35 Feet is the perfect depth to see good underwater creatures (25 - 60 is the general range). Plus the Superia X-TRA 800 35mm film is made especially for underwater light, managing the magenta and blues will be balanced, making your pictures more realistic than with regular film. The camera colors are perfect for easy visibility as well. I'll bet this could go to 50 feet in depth, but that is risking it. The manufacturer's are always conservative. Don't forget its great for snow skiing as well. Good product for the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased with the photo quality","review":"I used this camera on a recent vacation to the Yucatan in Mexico.

I took all the 27 pictures but was surprised to find out there were only a few pictures on the film. All the pics taken in the open were either lost or too dark to see anything. Under water, it did just ok; kodak does a better job. Do yourself a favor and buy a kodak disposable. If you still want to buy this one, get 2 of these and try out one at home before your big vacation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good unless it breaks","review":"We took three of these to the west indies so my daughter could complete a science assignment.

We took pictures in 45 - 70 foot of water.The visibility was greater than 100 ft. When the pictures were developed, they were either very faint or blank.It seems the camera needs a lot of light to give better pictures.

It looks very cool and I love the little lever to snap the photos. However, the proof is in the pictures. They came out horribly grainy, plain and simple. The few that were salvageable required a great deal of retouching. Many years ago I used Kodak's version of waterproof 35mm cameras and the picture quality was 10 times better.

I didn't want to get a big one so I opted for this one because it was a reasonable price and perfect size to fit in the play room. It was not very easy to put together, but I am not very handy either.After just one week of play (not everyday play) my son was jumping and the bungee cord snapped! My husband was able to cut off that part and fix it for the mean time(it broke where the piece to hold it in place was so it was an easy fix). This morning my son was doing light jumping and a screw fell out and the side came apart.It has now been removed from the room and will not be played with again. I would not recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Galt Folding Trampoline","review":"My grandson who was almost 3 when I purchased the trampoline loved to jump on it for a week or so but then his interest waned somewhat. He did learn to jump with 2 feet together though. It is not heavy enough in the back so lifts a little although it has never toppled over. It's good exercise and I would buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!","review":"I've had my trampoline for well over a year. I purchased it originally to help my son (who has mild CP) learn how to jump. It was a perfect aparatus for him to practice on. His PT brought it to our home for a trial and I knew immediately we would buy one. Ours arrived with a small questionable area (? split/cut) of integrity on the jumping surface. The company was very reputable in sending a replacement surface promptly and free of charge. I have had no further problems. My children continue to jump on the trampoline very frequently and have great fun on it. My children are now 42 mo and 27 mo and are small for their age. I think that due to the size of this portable trampoline I would question it's safety for very active and/or large kids older than 4 or 5. When jumped on aggressively, the trampoline can lift/tilt upward opposite from the handle end. Unless you were to put brackets over the rear \\"legs\\" to stabilize them this could pose a safety concern."},{"rating":"1","title":"leg broke when still new, seller did not return call or email","review":"The trampoline was alot of fun for the kids. When I tried to fold it up, the top part didn't fold which made it impossible to put under a bed, unfortunately. My 3 year old was playing with it and the one leg broke right off. Thank goodness no one was injured. Not well made at all. I tried to contact the seller via email and phone. 2 weeks later and still no response. Very disappointing. I would certainly not recommend purchasing from this vendor or purchasing this trampoline."},{"rating":"1","title":"broken bounce","review":"It is held together with a bungee cord that ripped apart in less than a week! with a 62 pound boy jumping on it. It is rated to 77 lbs. Don't believe it. It is not made to last AT ALL. Stay away unless you want it for a 2 year old... horror show!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not durable","review":"We've gone through two of these. My daughter has sensory issues and uses this trampoline a lot. It is near impossible to put together - it's one of the only toys my husband has complained about putting together. The first one lasted less than a year. The 2nd one has only lasted 5 months until one of the cords broke in half. That is after we've had to keep putting the screws in after they fall out all the time. So...we are off to buy a different brand. After 2 tries, I'm done trying to make it work. BTW, my daughter only weighs 36 lbs. I couldn't imagine if I child weighed more than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not constructed very well.","review":"I purchased this for my 2 year old grandson and he loved it; however it was not constructed very well. The handle broke loose from the frame on both sides making it unsafe for a small child. The only way it can be repaired is to take to a welding shop. For the price of this trampolineGalt Folding Trampoline, it was not worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy child!","review":"I'd been holding out on purchasing the trampoline for my daughter out of fear that she would become bored with it after some time. Boy was wrong! Daughter can't get enough of jumping to music and just jumping to jump. Perfect for those rainy days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the winter","review":"My kids (4 and 2 years old) love our outdoor trampoline, so we got this for the winter months. It's small enough to store out of the way and they love playing on it to burn off energy during the long winter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun, but....our bungee broke!","review":"We have had this trampoline for exactly 2 months, and my 2 year old uses it everyday when watching his DVDs. This morning,however, the bungee cord broke while my son was jumping on it. My husband was able to stretch the longest part of the existing cord enough to fix it temporarily, but we have to get a replacement cord because my son loves this trampoline and uses it so much. Besides the broken bungee, this is probably the best gift my son has ever received! For a child who loves to bounce, this is a great toy to have around--especially on a rainy day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining With Exercise","review":"My two daughters (ages 4 & 2 1/2) thoroughly enjoy their new indoor/outdoor trampoline. It seems to be very sturdy, and it wasn't too difficult or time consuming to assemble. I was inspired to purchase a trampoline after I saw how much my 2 1/2 year old enjoyed jumping on one at her Tumble Tots class. I do fear that it may eventually fall forward when they jump, but knock on wood, it hasn't happened. My kids like to swing from the bar, but I try to discourage that immediately. The only real problem we've had with the trampoline is the sharing factor. You know how kids can be? Regardless, it is instant entertainment with just the right amount of exercise for your little one."},{"rating":"1","title":"DANGER!!!","review":"Within five minutes of assembling this trampoline for our three-year-old daughter, she had hurled herself over the handlebar onto her head!She is very agile and strong, and had no trouble scaling the \\"safety\\" bar with her vigorous jumping. We tried adjusting the bar to a more upright angle, but the same thing happened! We are lucky she was not seriously injured, and have disassembled this toy.If you have a very active child, BEWARE! The tarp is much too bouncy, providing a dangerous launching pad for tots."},{"rating":"1","title":"The not so folding trampoline","review":"You have to unscrew the handle to fold the trampoline, so the folding option isn't great. I don't feel comfortable leaving it out for my 2.5 year old because of safety. He also likes to jump without the handle, so I have to be right near him. I got it because my son's therapists suggested a trampoline. I wish I had saved my money. This seller won't let you return it if it's been opened. By the way, it took my husband 2 hours to put it together. The bungee cord has to be threaded and stretched. BIG pain!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great trampoline","review":"We recently purchased this trampoline after the One Step Ahead trampoline my daughter had got recalled. As far I can tell this trampoline is almost identical but cost much less. My 3 year old gets many hours of enjoyment jumping on it and is probably one of the best toys we have purchased for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grandson's Birthday Present","review":"This item was ordered and delivery was promised by a certain date and it did not happen! I did not hear anything from anybody regarding the delay until I e-mailed them. They e-mailed back and promised another date which they did not deliver on. To date, the item has not been received and there have been no further communications. This is totally unacceptable and I will never order anything from Amazon/Baby Age again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Galt folding trampoline","review":"Got this for my childcare. All the kids love it. The folding part is helpful but still hard to move in and out of my inner garage door where I store it due to long handle. It has been a good purchase but due to much use the cord got frayed and I need to replace it. Otherwise, I found it a good value."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's not sturdy at all, broke in 1 month","review":"I had bought this for my son's OT sessions as he couldn't jump of from bare floor. First of all the the parts they sent had misaligned wholes, and the screws on the handle bar couldn't be assembled properly. The base was assembled properly. After 2-3 weeks when my son learned to jump on it holding the bar, it couldn't with stand the jumps and base bars broke after a week.It's not worth the money. Pl don't buy this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shouldn't advertise a trampoline with stars if that is not the one that is received.","review":"I decided on this trampoline because it was just the right size and the stars were cute for a little kid. When I received the trampoline it was just plain red.It was not the one I ordered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun but a pain","review":"Purchased this for my 3 year old who loved it. However, you constantly have to tighten the screws. And one of the sections that connects the two bars on the side snapped to where it is not fixable. So great toy just a pain. Now I have to get a new one. Not this one just new trampoline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Fun, Flimsy structure","review":"My seven year old son with Down syndrome received this for Christmas. He absolutely loved it. He only weighs 45 lbs and will jump for hours on this. The safety screws fall out all the time and we are continuously putting them back in. Also the elastic cord frayed and broke by the end of February. We called the company for a replacement and after almost a month, they sent us a new cord. It broke after only a week. Sadly, I think we must retire this well-loved trampoline because it is just not safe or durable enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check your packaging!","review":"We purchased this for our son from Amazon and received a combination of the toddler and child version, which translates to the jump handle is designed for front attachment and the trampoline has side attachment pieces. It was going to be an early Christmas present for my son, imagine how thrilled he was after 1 hr of waiting for daddy to assemble only to find out we were shipped the wrong one. Galt should do better quality control. The trampoline itself seems ok, but the way the bungee cord attaches at the base will likely come undone frequently leading to your child falling on the floor. Would not recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!","review":"This is one of the best interracial books that I have ever read! It was a real story and the charcters were off the hook! It was more than worth the purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"Based on the early reviews it sounded like this book had such potential. Unfortunately, that's all it had. There are so many \\"issues\\" with the heroine in this story that I don't know where to start. She's a woman who has a problem telling a man who \\"looks like George Clooney\\" that she loves him. She's concerned about being perceived as \\"easy\\" but once she goes to bed with him, she's only willing to have sex without attachment. I have enough emotional idiots around me. No need to spend money reading about them."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Money and Time","review":"The heroine of this novel is terribly weak and therefore, unbelivable (as is the plot!). What man (black or white) would waste his time with the heroine? Personally, I would have dropped her after the first 25 pages!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth my hard earned money","review":"This book was..off hte top of my head annoying. Jenny was annoying. She was the typical black woman (in IR books) running away from a man she didnt htink she should be attracted to or want becuase he was white. Mick was the typical white man being abused by the typical black woman while trying to convince her that they belonged to her and he loved her and they could make it work. The s/l was VERY typical. Reading of a white man not wanting to jump headfirst in a realtionship with a black woman would have been more interesting and not to mention different. I dont know how Mick put up with her and towards the end, he didnt but he caved. Jenny was just senseless and all becuase he was white. Again, this book was just annoying but it wasnt horrid and if you really just want to read a book...it will do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where You Find It entertaing","review":"I did read other reviews but found I had to check it out for myself. Yes the heroine Jennifer was a little controlling...I am woman I can do it all on my own, and part of me admired her for it. However Mick was the man. He didn't let her dictate the movement of the relationship. Okay she broke it off but I somehow had faith my Mick would wear her down, boy did he. The other charcters were wonderful support in the story. Her little girl who drew them together and her best friend telling GF how it is. Love when a GF honestly tells the other one they are stuck on stupid, it just tickles me. Well the book satifised this romantic reader, and I'm very pleased I purchased this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete waste of a tree","review":"This book was a waste of my time. I really wish that I could have the three hours it took to read this \\"book\\" back. First off, the typos threw me off, second, the main character Jenn was the most indecisive woman I have ever read about (and I hate indecisive people) Third, Mick's constant references to Jenn as his \\"Brown Beauty\\" and \\"brown love\\" really irked and insulted me. I am supportive of IR love but this book left me with a bad taste in my mouth. If my man kept on referring to my skin tone, I would dump him in a minute. Better off skipping this book altogether. It's not worth the money spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"One word...disappointing.

It is not a starchy academic biography removed from the living currents of an author's life.

Neither understands why bad things are happening now.Meanwhile, Clinton, who worked for the law in Chicago, has moved to their town.

The air intake chambers on the side are not even functional. The air intake is directly under the wick. The result?....this thing blows out in any kind of medium wind. Here is the best part of the lamps qualities......it leaks. It doesn't just leak a little, it leaks a LOT. When filled to the point where the fake air chambers connect to the fuel tank, at that spot is where the kerosene pours out. If you are walking with it while it is lit, care must be taken to not allow the kerosene/fuel to slosh around or it will spill out the leak hole. As leak holes go, it is a real good one that V&O supplied as a no cost option.

I purchased eight to use outdoors on my deck during the summer. Two leaked like a sieve as soon as they were filled and dripped flammable oil all over my deck. The metal is so poorly fit that there are cracks between the base and the arms that support the glass and top, and the oil just drips and drips. Of course once filled with a flammable substance (that has dripped all over the outside of the lamp), they can't be mailed back so I ended up throwing them away. I expect the that if the other six don't spring a leak before the end of the season I will be lucky. I will probably just throw the remainder away even if they last that long, and look for something of higher quality for next year (or maybe sooner).

The Daybreakers is the best Sackett book I have read to date. With beautiful imagery of the new american west and thoughtful page devotion to its characters and setting. It has great gunfights and a quick-paced story to back them up. I now find myself as big a fan of the warm frontier years as I was of the cold sterile future. I recommend this book to anyone with enough time to give this great story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfinished and a bit disappointing","review":"Many of the stories in this book are interesting -- at first. Then they just end abruptly -- no payoff, no closure. There is something to be said for an open ending -- but when an entire collection of short stories end that way, it is frustrating for the reader. It also leads one to believe that the author was not pushing herself hard enough (This is not a swipe at the author, just a reader's observation). I finally became bored with the format and disappointed with the stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can the characters have their own voices please","review":"Despite the fact that the narrators in these stories are poor, uneducated, rural children, they speak in syntactically complex sentences with preposterously broad, sophisticated vocabularies.Really, Ava -- the young girl abandoned alone in the swamp in the first story, who at 12 years old doesn't seem to have been to school in years -- uses phrases like \\"her body doesn't ululate in dead languages.\\"? Expresses refined sentiments like \\"infinity comes lapping over, concentric circles on still water\\"?Come on.In other words, they all speak in the voice of the highly educated MFA who created them, not in anything that could possibly be their own voices. That was a dealbreaker for me right off the bat. I'm surprised that this collection is as well reviewed as it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"can't wait to see more from this author.","review":"this a deliciously haunting book. the characters seemed very very relateable (which is a difficult emotion to conjure for me when i read a novel), i suppose because they weren't 'normal'. the plots and characters were all very original and enticing. the only problem most people seem to have with these stories is that its open-ended. the stories don't 'end' per se. which is what i LOVE about this work; it is very unique, and the way i see it, does a story ever really end? it allows you to fill in the blanks yourself, if that makes sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"well-written, but unsettling","review":"I tried really hard to like this book. It is very well-written, but parts of it just make me uncomfortable. I also felt that the stories ended in inappropriate places, and none of them really tied-up at the end. I read the first 4 stories, then I stopped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"My book group read this book for our last meeting. Those who showed up to discuss the book were unanimously disappointed. The majority opinion is that the stories are dark and disturbing and leave you hanging with no ending much less a happy ending. We were impressed by Karen Russell's writing but left hanging and disturbed by her story content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete and utter disappointment","review":"I just finished the book and am very disappointed. And in all honesty, this book was disappointing from the start.The stories were vaguely entertaining...but this is simply because they were so odd. Unfortunately, being able to invent weird places and situations doesn't take much.The tone and diction (ESPECIALLY the diction!) is a joke. The author attempts at writing from a child's point of view in many of the stories and fails miserably.The stories don't have endings. The author tries to leave the reader hanging but the stories just end abruptly I was never \\"left hanging\\" because I didn't care. I didn't care because the characters were so unconvincing and the stories didn't move me at all.All in all, this book was a complete waste of money. And, I regret financially supporting such an idiotic author. I know middle schoolers that can write more intelligently and convincingly than this fraud of an author."},{"rating":"1","title":"huh?","review":"I found Karen Russell's St. Lucy's Home for Girls Raised by Wolves in a short story anthology and thought it was funny, as well as brillant in its originality of a philosophy...that of society trying to make us all the same cookie cutter, and in the process turning us into robotic, water downed versions of ourselves, devoid of character. That was it's real shine. I have attempted to read Swamplandia! and this book of short stories in hopes for more of that insight and originality; but I think now that Karen Russell hit on something unawares, and never could get it again; like knocking the ball out of the park, but not knowing how you did it. Her batting average is around 10%; I found her stories pretentious and devoid of any real meaning...the long titles...the fabricated places...the odd character names..etc...only work when there is something of substance behind it; other than that, it looks gimmicky. She has admittedly one brillant short story, that she seems to be building a career upon."},{"rating":"1","title":"St. Lucy's Home for Girls Raised by Wolves....","review":"wow! I want my money back.

That works just fine for some of them, less so for others. But they all are beautifully written in something that is like magical realism, but more absurd and edgy. My pleasure in them came not so much from my enjoyment of the specific \\"tales,\\" as from my awe at the the author's imagination and prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the reviews","review":"I bought this book out of curiosity and because the reviews on amazon made it sound so good. I love her use of imagery and metaphors and agree with most readers on how lovely this book is, but I'm a little disappointed with the flow of the stories. Each story begins so elegantly, but always looses my attention during a change of thought or scenery. I find myself having to reread ever so often just to make sense of the paragraphs. I really want to like it, but feel that I'm starting to get A.D.D from reading it. I guess I just prefer books that flow and make reading easier. All in all this is a lovely book and should be enjoyed if you have the time and I would recommend buying a used copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Suit","review":"Despite being less familiar than brands like Speedo & TYR, this a solid suit.

Won't Buy from Movie Mars Again","review":"I had seen the Zombieland in the theatre and enjoyed its dry/warped sense of humor. Not a movie for young children. I wanted to see it again and wanted to purchase a copy rather than rent. I have used MovieMars in the past with no complaint, but the Zombieland DVD I received from them would not boot up and indicated \\"Regional Code Error\\". I live in the USA, they appear to have a disclaimer about DVDs with a \\"Regional Code Error\\", that they are not responsible for the fault. They will accept returns, but did not appear to include shipping either way in the refund, so for the $5 transaction, I would have spent more in gas to the post office than I would get back in the refund.

Saw it in theaters several times and couldn't wait for it to come out on dvd. If you like comedy you'll love this. It's action packed and keeps you laughing pretty much the whole time. Although the movie is quite funny, there are some somber moments throughout it. If you liked movies like Hot Fuzz, Shawn of the Dead, etc. you will absolutely love this one and definitely won't regret the purchase.

However, I love movies that make fun of horror movies and zombie movies. Zombieland, like Shaun of the Dead, does this extremely well. Woody Harrelson's character is a parody of a butt-kicking action hero, while Jesse Eisenberg's character is like a young Woody Allen trying to survive a plague of zombies while battling social ineptness, various neuroses, paranoia, and oh yes, a crippling phobia of clowns.

If your concerned about gratuitous violence, well it's a zombie movie. The violence factor is high, but the gore factor is low. If you like dark humor with a lot of violence, this movie is for you. Eisenberg and Harrelson play off each other very well and there's some subtle humor that some may find even more entertaining then the obvious stuff.

It more focused on the love story between boy and girl. The few zombie scenes in the first two-thirds of movie were extremely short. We kept wondering when they were going to run into zombies, they went long stretches without any and then they would give us a two minute zombie scene.

The problem is, that once the four main characters get together, there's too much talking and not enough zombies.Woody Harelson was interesting and the Bill Murray cameo was great. \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" knew how to integrate horror and comedy but this movie quickly morphed into an uninteresting \\"road movie\\" I know this is not supposed to be highbrow entertainment but I was expecting much more from this.

The blood and guts are always somehow ironic and goofy, befitting the tone of this spoof. Woody is good, Jesse does his best Michael Cera impression as always (seaparted at birth, those two?), and it's nice and short, moving quickly and never getting dull.Bill Murray's bit is quite funny if not hilarious, but make sure to watch past the credits at the end to see a very funny bit with him reprising his Caddyshack Carl in zombie makeup.Looks good in blu-ray; all things considered, Zombieland is a bright send-up of the zombie/thriller genre, and worth seeing if you feel like some bloody laughter."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're Not Clever if You're Pointless","review":"The movie started off fairly decent. A stereotypical neurotic dweeb-heeb details his hard and fast rules for survival in Zombieland. What a nice boy and yes, how cliché.

Unless you consider the obvious, and narrated in case you're too stupid to get it, bonding scenes poignant and integral. In a comedy send-off of a zombie film they're not.I was at the turn-off point here. Very boring and brought the movie to a complete halt.The scenes in the amusement park were inexplicable and anticlimactic.The trailer falsely led you to believe that this film would have more comical zombie slayings and zombie interactions.

No, really.The acting is bad.There's no memorable musical score.There's no \\"Art\\" in any of the cinematography.None of the characters develop or change throughout the film.Product placement, product placement, product placement!!!None of the characters show any emotion.The premise is a set-up for the end battle.There is no tension, no suspense and nothing scary ever happens, so this is not a horror film.There is no humor, not even a chuckle, so this is not a comedy.There is no point to the movie at all. Since the characters have no depth, it is as if watching a bad cartoon.

In a zombie Apocalypse? And why is the electricity still on everywhere? *yawn* Woody Harrelson is hard to dislike in anything he's in, and this is no exception, but what is with Jesse Eisenberg? He is like the poor-man's Michael Cera. Except way more annoying and unlikable. Go see a zombie movie worth seeing, like the original \\"Dawn of the Dead (Divimax Edition)\\" or the not strictly zombie pic \\"28 Days Later (Widescreen Edition).\\" Zombieland: What a load of junk, and not even any fun when considered as parody. It even manages to make Bill Murray seem boring and unfunny. Glad I saw it on demand for five bucks instead of paying for it permanently.

I expected Woody to carry the film comedically but was sadly disappointed to find that the film lacked any shred of sophistication or cleverness.

I mean, some of the zombie stuff was quite good and some was quite funny, there just wasn't enough. But that's not what this film was really about and therein lies my disappointment. It was a teen romance movie plain and simple; it was just disguised as a zombie flick most likly to get folks like me to buy a ticket. That's why I'm having a problem with it. By the way, Woody was Woody and that's always good, and it was Woody, more than anything else, that got this film an extra star; in my humble opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not particularly scary or funny, just stupid.","review":"I didn't quite know what to expect from Zombieland and expected something similar to Sean of the Dead. It had a good cast and the first 10 minutes were great. Unfortunately the film was all downhill from there and dragged on another 100 minutes to its entirely predictable conclusion.The movie really couldn't make up its mind on what it wanted to be: romantic comedy, slapstick, horror light, and the viewing audience suffered for it.At least I didn't see it in the theaters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"I started Zombieland expecting to laugh hysterically from beginning to end. Minus a couple Hostess and Bill Murray-related chuckles, I was rather disappointed. I'm aware that I'm in the minority here, but it didn't deliver as a horror movie or a comedy. Woody Harrelson's character was moderately funny, but the rest of the cast was pretty awful. The kid was flawed way beyond being sympathetic, well into simply pathetic, and the girls were not likable. At all. I'd have given it 1.5 stars if possible.Bottom line, lots of people adored Zombieland, but it only made me want to watch Shaun of the Dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie is great. Sony continues to prove themselves a terrible company.","review":"Zombieland is an excellent movie - funny, and it has zombies. What more could you ask? This copy of the blu-ray, however, is a complete rip off. One of the reasons I purchased this version was that it came with the digital copy, but the digital copy had expired before I purchased the disc. This is fraud, plain and simple.

Woody Harrelson in his most fun role since Natural Born Killers.And to top it off probably one of the BEST cameo appearances EVER (I may be biased on that point since I am a HUGE HUGE fan).To sum it up, pick it up and I'm pretty sure most people would enjoy this very humorous film."},{"rating":"2","title":"So funny","review":"This movie is sooo funny!

Brilliantly done.Think \\"Scary Movie\\", but not utterly idiotic and stupid.There's some suspense which I guess classifies this as a mild horror movie (keep in mind, I wasn't scared at all during this movie, I don't think it's a real horror, it's more of a comedy). But more than anything is the humor which is just excellent.Characters are all quite awesome.

However, if you are someone who enjoys the sound of gun blasts and zombies being splattered by those guns, combined with some respectable humor, then give Zombieland a try. It's not a great comedy. It's not a great horror. It's just somewhere in between. But, in a sick, fun way, it's enjoyable.SPOILERS BELOW:Maybe this can be classified as a \\"guy movie\\"? My wife doesn't care for it.

Good or bad I'd watch them all. Zombieland however, is actually a very good one. Falling into the same comedic zombie genre as \\"Shawn of the Dead\\", Zombieland delivers plenty of the gore we expect while perfectly timing bellies of laughter. This is an easy recommendation.Blu-ray Review:The Zombieland Blu-ray is sure to please all who buy it. It offers a near reference quality 1080p picture and has a wonderful balanced DTS-HD MA audio soundtrack. The disk also contains a hefty dose of special features to complete the deal.

In his novel every detail is designed to fit the taste of the western perspective on Islam and muslims: exotic, erotic, and thus intriguing; hidden, unknown and thus dangerous.

In other words, you good a good variety of stories.There are several theme dvd sets to choose from, something for everyone with different tastes.This particular set, \\"Mutation & Transformation\\" was entertaining, also providing a moral at the end of each episode about the moral and ethical implications of bio-engineering for example.** Thought provoking--- highly recommended **"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Color Purple","review":"This was very interesting.

Celie, the main character, is merely a little girl when the book starts.Throughout the story you will share Celie's take on her childhood, her marriage, and her search for love. There is a big world out there for her and you can join her on her journey to discovering herself..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Use of Time!","review":"As I read this book, I was in awe at the bluntness of events that take place. The dialogue is amazing. It captures very well the feelings, tone, and words of blacks in the southern portion of the United States in the early 1900s. This particular dialogue made the novel extremely interesting and gave it a certain touch of authenticity. Also, the format of the novel, in written letters between two people, held my interest. I was actually affected by the characters' experiences. The protagonist, Celie, is a character whom many are prejudiced against. Because, after a terribly long struggle to survive, she eventually finds happiness, I, too, felt liberated. This book has much to offer and is worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Color Purple","review":"The Color Purple is an amazing book to read.The book tells you the struggle and obstacles Celie went through throughout the book.

It could be as simple as what you choose to where to school one day, or as complex as a decision that will change the rest of your life. Also, almost everyone loves to have some amount of power. Power and perspective are two main themes that are portrayed in The Color Purple. Another main theme is change. The way in which Celie, Sophia, and Nettie change because of power, control, and perception, play a large role in this novel. The way in which these three women change, however, are incredibly different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alice Walker's \\"The Color Purple\\"","review":"I am a fifteen year old sophomore at Western Sr. High School.

It is one of those books you can open up to any page and just get lost in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Colorful!","review":"It took a little effort to understand Celie's deeply southern and black speak, but it was worth all the effort of rereading her lines...The lingo added more to her characterization. Just as well, the voice of her educated sister Nettie. Not only did their voices gave life to them but to the other characters, too.I've always enjoyed reading about the mundane, ordinary, everyday lives of other cultures. What more to read about an existence of not only purple but a myriad of colors! This story is about oppression as much as freedom; about depression as much as hope; about indifference as much as love; about discovery, family, friendship, and the tenacity of the human spirit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why did this happen?","review":"I saw the movie and heard so much about this book and wanted to know more.

The Color Purple, about a downtrodden African American named Celie, is inspiring and beautiful even with the rough way it is written - rough as in dialect, not as in the author's talent. Even though it deals with such controversial subjects as lesbianism, sexual and physical abuse, domestic violence, and infidelity, it is so touchingly and innocently written that there is no way that anyone could find offense. Celie, only fourteen when first subjected to sexual abuse, rises above all troubles and finds a place where nature and love rule. With the help of the wild and gorgeous Shug Avery, she realizes her own importance in the world and asserts it to the fullest. There is no other way to say it: this book is absolutely beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Color Purple, a moving novel","review":"The Color Purple is an awesome book about a downtrodden women named Celie. She has lived her whole life doing everything others have told her to do and is not leading a very happy life. She marries a man that wanted her sister and was sexually abused by her father. I thoroughly enjoyed this book because it reveals the life of women who are abused and how they are able to finally take control of their own life and live it the way they want to. It is a very powerful and moving book that once you've read it you will never forget the impact it has."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great novel","review":"This novel is simply beautiful.

A++++ story."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Color Purple","review":"This book was written in diary form of communication between Celie and God. This was a good way of communication to express her inner emotion feelings. Celie had a really hard life, but she was always able to stay in a positive attitude. She struggles a lot through her life being an abused and uneducated black women. At the ending part she was able to have herslef realize that her was very well loved by everyone. This was a really good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story of a little discussed topic -- incest and wife abuse among blacks","review":"I had not seen the movie made from this book, so I knew little about its subject. Not recently published, the dialect seems acurate and the spelling appropriate. All of the sufferings of Celie are clearly described in convincing language. Surprisingly, the ending is happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Color Purple","review":"The Color Purple is a very amazing book. It is inspiring and encouraging. I advise all students in high school to read it. It teaches you that through all the bad things that happen in life, if you just keep your head up and never give up, good things will happen to you. By putting it in diary form, Alice Walker, made it easier for me to read it. At some points I thought it was a little boring when Celie and Nettie kept writing to each other. But it was also interesting for Celie to know what was going on with her sister in Africa and Europe.By reading this book, you can probably relate to what was going on. I think Alice Walker wrote this book from some of her past experiences with herself and some of the people around her, which makes this novel even better. More people can relate and understand. Although people might think that she goes a little far in some of the scenes, that is life, and many authors do it. The Color Purple was a great learning experience for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad","review":"The color purple is a great novel to read for the ages 15 and up. I am a high school student who totally enjoyed reading this book. Every page leaves you shocked or curious to know what is going to happen next in the story. the novel starts off with eye catching material that will have the readers wondering about the book from the beginning to the end on how exciting and different this novel might be. The color purple builds up in the beginning and has a major twist that is least expected in the middle. the novel deals with a little explicit language and homosexuality and if you are not a mature reader you should not read this novel.But the storied told in this novel tells you about a young girls life which would make you feel like your life is not so bad compared to her life after all.So go pick it up I guarantee you will love it since it is a Prize Winning Novel"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic and timeless","review":"the story is told in the form of intimate letters written to God, by Celie, a young woman who survived incestous rape and domestic violence, during a time in the South when women, and especially black women had no support. The letters to God, in a sense emphasized Celie's position, he was the only one who would listen. The Color Purple is simply written, yet filled with deeper meanings and symbolisms, if you look deep enough. IF you read only the surface, you will miss a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly influential","review":"I would have never read this book had it not been assigned to me. That being said I am glad it was, this boom really changed my perspective on the world.

I get why it's written that way...just don't care for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Intereting","review":"I'd never read the book or seen the movie, and didn't really know what it was all about. Just knew about all the awards & acclaim they had, so I decided to read the book & see what it was all about. It wasn't what I expected, but it was very interesting, sad, a good look into life in the south for a black woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Night Table Reading","review":"I read this book after I had seen the movie fifty or more times. The adage saying you should read the book first definitely holds true, but Spielberg remained fairly faithful to the book. What I liked most was the honesty breathing through the story of Celie and Nettie. Few people really know the South and the community which is written about, but in knowing it so well, Walker doesn't make the mistakes so many other writers do: She doesn't present the reader with a stereotype, she just presents the facts for the story. My vision was never clouded by her view of things, rather it was enhanced by what she noticed these characters telling her. I would recommend this novel for anyone, but those who are offended by honesty should stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissatisfied!","review":"The Color Purple may depict the poor neglected black of that time, but I am disappointed with some of the language used. When I attempted to open the online book, it wouldn't open. The sample didn't contain the graphic sexual language. It isn't something I would recommend others to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasic Read","review":"I know this is a book review but firstly the movie version is my all time favourite movie. I'm crying at the start because I already know the ending. Even though I read the book after seeing the movie many times and as usual it is slightly different to the movie the book didn't disappoint me. It was a great read. It was just like I had the movie playing in another room and I could hear the characters voices. I love how the story is told through Celie's letter to both God and Nettie.

Quite frankly, I would not recommend it to my friends nor to my enemies (if I had any)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inappropriate for any age","review":"I hope to never see this book on one of my chilren's school reading list. I believe in fidelity and that sex is between a married couple - one man and one woman. That this book could be seen as a classic and worthy of reading is beyond me. The way the author introduces homosexuality, lesbianism, and bisexuality is a subtle way of saying they are okay and normal. I whole heatedly disagree with this concept. I unfortunately did not understand what \\"purple\\" meant in relationship to homosexuality - naive. My husband immediately knew what the book was about when he heard the title. I wish I could have the time it took me to read this book back and the memories and images wiped out."},{"rating":"1","title":"In schools, really?","review":"I cant believe that they use this book in schools.

I'm sorry that I even finished the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Odd!","review":"First of all, i really give this book 0 stars, but that option wasn't available. I thought this book was the most retarded book I have ever and will ever read. Most of all, the sex scenes could have been edited. The incest, rape, molestation, lesbianism, whoredom etc. were all perverted and disgusting! Also, the story was so choppy and rambling that it was pointless. Yes, I understand Celie was oppressed by Mr.____, but lesbianism is not the answer to her liberation. I think the book was poorly written and not well thought out. I'm sorry, but it takes a sick mind to think up stuff like this. I never would have read it if I had known what I was getting in to."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is awful!","review":"All the book is about is sex, sex, sex! Celie and her father, Celie and Mr. _____, Mr, _____ and Shug, Celie and Shug, and Celie by herself. It's revolting! Why do they let this book be read in school, yet they won't show movies or other books b/c of their sexual content. It's a joke! The whole plot of the story stinks! It's been way overused my society. And people can say all they want about me only looking at the outside, and not the in-depth reading of the book, but they're wrong! I understood what the book was trying to say, but it could've been said without the sex. Even without the sex, though, the book is awful. It's about nothing at all, really. They say that it's about a black woman's struggle, but that's not true. It's about how a black woman fell in love with her husband's lover, who was also a black woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offended and Disappointed","review":"I am a woman and was extremely offended at the portrayel of Black men in this book and in the movie. The work offers NO BALANCE whatsoever which feels like a slap in the face. One Black male in this book could have been something other than weak or cruel. It is no wonder Spielberg was eager to take on the project and white people are going to the theater in droves. The castration of the Black male has always been their main attraction, apparently Oprah's as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book should be banned","review":"This book is the collection of sick perverted ravings of Alice Walker. I started reading the book thinking it had to be great to win the Pullitzer Prize, but I couldn't even finish it because it was so grossly sickening. I urge you to not read this book because it will subvert you and defile your mind with unwanted perverseness."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought it was a very different type of story","review":"I read this book for an english book report. I found it disturbing with the incest, rape, turning to lesbianism. It was hard to follow, but the ending was alright. I really got annoyed at the Mr.______ though. I don't think I'd really recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definatly should not be on any schools required reading list","review":"Although the author probobly had good intentions of writing a good book she failed.

This story defines what black women of the 1930's had to endure. Walker's character detail and vivid cultural settings come across extremely real.

A must read, for sure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic For All To Read","review":"This story deals with the life of a black woman named Celie. She has had a terrible life and her only refuge, her sister, Nettie, are not together. Along with the riveting narritve Walker gives great deatail of how life was in rural Georgia. This book shows many themes but one of the stronger ones is the idea of self worth and value of the individual which is personified by the character Shug Avery. This book is also very controversial because of its language and graphic scences. Walker is not going to hide the way life was for many blacks during this time period in American history. This book will open your eyes to the wonders and horrors of the life in the South for a black woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly Written, like Toni Morrison's Blue Eyes","review":"This book actually captured my eyes since i began reading the first page that starts with, \\"Dear God\\" Alice Walker was successful at pulling readers into her own world where Celie, Shug Avery, Mr.____,and Nettie. i could not talk to Celie, Nettie, o anyone, but i was actually hearing them sitting next to Celie, as an invisible thing.I highly recommend this book to everyone, women, and men, white, and black, or asian. \\"The color purple\\" will pull you into its world like gravity.

Although I was a book based on turn arounds and troubling plots. You never know really what Mr. blank she is talking about at any time. In a whole people got married then divorced it did ofcourse bring a ton of insight of different cultures and how they acted. I do like the journal writing between the sisters but you also get lost in how old or new the letters are since a certain person hid them. In a whole I honestly don't know if I should recommend this book or not it has it's goods and bads"},{"rating":"2","title":"A memorable book.","review":"I highly recommend this book.

However, it wasn't captivating,deep, triumphant or anything by my standards. I love to read stories about the real world and how life really is.I understand why it was written how it was but it just was not an appealing piece to me. I think the plot was great, and american struggling to make a place for her name in society, to be seen and heard but the way it was put together put me to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"misleading","review":"This book contained some good material. It was hard to get into. I felt as if Alice Walker decided to create only one important character; Celie. The other characters in the book weren't even worthy of names? The English grammar used really bothered me at first. I believed the plot was excellent but the story line to go along with it didn't do any justice. It seemed pointless to me. I never fell in love with any of the characters because you were never given enough information to relate to them. There were an excessive amount of characters that had no impact on the story whatsoever. I must admit, there were a few intriguing parts in the book. I'm all for women making a name for themselves in this world but I'm not sure this book actually portrayed the strength that I believe women possess. As I said before, I have mixed feelings about this book but it isn't anything I would recommend to anybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Good....","review":"I can understand how some people might find this book good but to me it was just plain confusing. There are too many characters and it is very hard to keep track of who she is talking about and who she's talking too. Plus, you don't know weither she is saying something or thinking something because there is no quotations used (at least that was the case in the version of the book that I have) to tell the difference between thoughts and dialogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take care before buying this","review":"Before you buy this book please take a few minutes to read about the author. You will quickly discover that Alice Walker is an inveterate racist bigot. She has openly proclaimed her hatred of Jews, participated in a terrorist flotilla against the Jewish state and has hobnobbed with the elite of the Middle East terror organizations. Her most recent racist stunt was to publicly proclaim that her book not be translated into Hebrew because she does not want Jews to read her book.As for her book, one can only say that it is an obnoxious hypocrisy. A book supposedly about the horrors of racism written by a racist!Please do not patronize this evil woman.

The book is written through letters to God and between to sisters. I personally dont like the way the story is written. I think that these letters draw the book out far too long. Also i thought the book on a whole was not very intersting."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"This was one fantastic read. Alice Walker has a way for pulling each character to the fore front and giving them discriptive qualities that will either make you hate or absolutely fall in love with them. What really kept me enthralled when reading this book was that Walker made each character seem alive by showing how people can change and grow for the better or worse, as well as the ups and downs each character faces whether financial means, family or love matters.I sincerely regretted finishing the book and will be buying more books by Alice Walker soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"C.Dawson","review":"The Color Purple is a really great book. It deals with homosexuality, aduse, confusion, seduction, and conflict lighten the dark pages in each chapter.Misconcepter of love, twist from the characters who get tangled up in a mysterious love triangle. who knews Jerry Springer would hit the mind of Alice Walker. poiwerful emotions are hearty-lengthed in this book due to the strong femmine bond built in the book about facing fears, building characterization among ones self.For me personaslly,this book took a turn for me because as an avid feadern of drama, crime, mysterious plots and erotica The Color Purple is a mixture of all my joys to pick up a book and get lost in each word, rather its 500 words or 50,000.*** If The Color Purple was a hot beat produce for Nelly, I would defintely buy the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't put the book down","review":"The Color Purple was a great book, which showed that a woman can get through real tough times and find happiness. The way it is written, in a journal type of way, gets straight to what the character was thinking and gets to the point. i was unable to put the book down and got me to think that if you want happiness you make it yourself. this book teaches you so much and gets you wanting to read it again and again. The narrator goes through so much in the book, from abuse from her dad to her husband, getting raped, being pregnant and getting her children taken away from her, losing her sister and much more. But then everything turn around when she meets this woman, Shug Avery, who helps her find her voice and speak out. That's when she starts to find happiness. This is a truly great book that everyone should read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well-written book about a woman coming of age.","review":"A wonderfully written book about a woman coming of age. Throughout the book Celie journeyed from a young woman to a woman able to accept herself and her circumstances the way they were. Her journey carried her from mere existence to actual living and enjoying life. It was a journey of an uneducated woman that learned to take control of her life without bitterness or regret. I found the book both intriguing and hard to put down. I highly recommend it to anyone on a journey for self-discovery."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Color Purple was remarkable; it touched my heart & soul","review":"I have watched The Color Purple over and over again, and I must say the movie was remarkable and cried out in excellence.

There have been any number of critics who cite problems with the novel's plot and even attack the book for casting the black male in a bad light (debatable), but nearly everyone agrees that it is a book that must be read once it is begun, and this is owing to Walker's great narrative strengths. This one ranks up there with the great books of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good insight in the situation of black women","review":"In my opinion the novel \\"The Color Purple\\" is a very good book. You get information about the situation of black women; how they were treated and where they stood in society. The book shows the situation very detailed and it was very interesting to read it. If somebody wanted to know more about the situation of black women he or she has to read this book. The film to this book is not good because the producer left out some important sections."},{"rating":"2","title":"important and interesting novel","review":"I think it is a very wonderful novel concerning the role of blacks and women. you learn something about this important topic and you really can feel the emotions of the actors. It is written in a very emotional way. After reading, you are thinking about the situation of Celie and you are trying to put yourself in the position of Celie. Besides, the relationship between Celie and Shug Avery is very exciting because Shug is the only one who gives her the feeling to be someone. And that helps her to stand the situation. To sum up, I think it was very interesting to read the color purple."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic book","review":"I like this book very much. Normally I do not read very often books but I had to do it for the English lessons. Normally the books you read for the lessons are very boring, but this book was very exiting and dealt with a problem that is known in our society: The underpression of women and a homosexual relationship. Celie the main character in this book is treated very bad from her man. He rapes her and treat her on very violent way. Celie do not know what real love it because she was ever treated bad from other people. This changed when she gets to know the lover of her husband. She shows Celie how beatiful and valueable she is.

Sad, but a definite lesson in life.","review":"I definitely, without a doubt, love this book! I'm pretty sure it has every type of person imaginable in this book:the strong, the weak, the sinner, the devout christian, everything. One lesson that Alice Walker taught me was that everything in your life is a reflection of you. There was a place in the book when Shug said,\\"It ain't bad. But I just feel funny living in a square. If I was square, then I could take it better.\\" She wanted to live in a round house, because she was round. If she were square then it wouldn't bother so much living in a square house."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a wonderful book that I have ever read.","review":"I can not stop of reading \\"The Color Purple.\\" This is a wonderful book that I have ever read.

There are interviews with other comedians (Don Rickles is actually funny here), and people in her life. It's amazing what she goes through in a year: panic, failure, philanthropy, stress, a comedy central roast, painfully dropping long-term business partners, disappointment with the nature of the biz, and a career revival via celebrity apprentice. Showbiz is SO nasty! And so is Joan! I was unimpressed with some of her newer material, though most of it was great. There is a clear line between over the top and stupid, and often Joan (likely in desperation) channels idiocy for laughs. But at the end of this show, I understood why.

This is the real woman who hates seeing her appointment callendar blank.Ricki Stern keeps the focus on Rivers..in good or bad. What amazes me is Rivers recants her career as well as the year in her life. It is the ups and downs in that year.One of the highlights is a heckler who talks back to Rivers from the stage and how she puts him in his place.This is an amazing piece of filmmaking.

Some critics (like in the penguin guide) have put down this quite a bit...they're very wrong. I have heard many recordings of these symphonies and can tell you that you will never hear a more heavy 1st symphony...interestingly enough the 2nd is mysterious and compelling(I've never heard a 2nd quite like it!), the 3rd is vast and detatched, and 4th is so firey and intense that it's hard to think that Klemperer had that in him!

Well-illustrated maps and superb index are among its strongest qualities. But note that the single European currency, Euro, came into circulation a year after the publication of this Second Edition. As a result, all the prices in the E.U. zone are listed in the outdated pre-Euro currencies of individual nations.

Having now read the book, I can say confidently that the hype is definitely not deserved. In fact, I found this book to be the worst kind of substance-less, hollow nonsense. Reichheld criticizes traditional measurement systems, and in some ways his criticisms are fair (trust me, I know). But his solution is truly mindless; should I or anyone really believe that all of my company's relationships with its diverse customer segments can be optimized by asking just one question? I know Reichheld has been big shot consultant for many years, but perhaps he needs to spend a little more time in an actual corporation dealing with actual customers before dispensing bad advice about customer relationship management."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate Worthwhile Business Book","review":"I am a pretty cynical reader of business books: I'm a CEO, I've read hundreds of business books (and have left many unfinished), and I've written a book myself. The Ultimate Question is one of the best business books I've read in a long time.Although Fred Reichheld is getting lots of kudos for his elegant concept of \\"Net Promoters\\", it's not the only valuable idea in this book. Most notable is his section on \\"Good Profits vs. Bad Profits\\", which is profound, and which should make most executives immeditately transform the way they think about their companies.Personally, as I was reading the book, I literally found myself stopping to write notes to my company's clients, wondering whether we'd done enough to deserve their loyalty.

When I contacted Nesco they told me to ship it to them and they would repair or replace it. Which they did and now it works great.

The idea of making a book about firetrucks into the shape of a firetruck (with real, moving wheels) is adorable. But the book is constructed flimsily. My son received this book as a gift when he was six months old, and played with it for about 20 minutes before the back cover came off the book. It appears to have been \\"bound\\" to the book with artist's tape. Within another week the book had split in half, so the wheeled sections were no longer joined. The truck was useless as anything but a chew-toy.If you have a child who is *very* delicate and careful with his or her books, then this is a good purchase. But for a regular kid that chews on board books and bangs them around, you won't get your money's worth out of this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Board Book","review":"Cute, but not made well at all.

Bought them for my daughter, 28 months old. They break easily when they roll off the table They should have a stop molded into them to prevent them from rolling.

We have put through about a dozen rolls of film on it, and although with time it has improved, the first images were really out of focus. It's like it needs to be broken in! Recently, the photos have been getting better, but it always produces pictures where the objects in the background are more in focus than the image in the centre of the photo that we orignally focussed on.

Because it is a studio recording, and because Corelli changes a lot from his previous recordings, I believe it to be the best recording he has ever made of this opera. The sound quality is also a heck of a lot better than the 1962 recording. I can't comment on Leonora's part because I've only heard excerpts of the CD but I did love Price :~("},{"rating":"2","title":"An (almost) top flight Trovatore","review":"Because it's such a hammy melodrama, falling short of its stable-mates, Traviata and Rigoletto, in human itnerest, Il Trovatore is usually turned into a blatant exhibition of lung power. That's certainly true here when it comes to the Manrico of Corelli and the Count di Luna of Merrill. They shout to reach the bleachers. Far more artistic is Gabriella Tucci's vulnerable, humane Leonora, and yet the all-around effect of the whole set is positive. I can honestly say, as a great un-fan of Signor Corelli, that his virile, over-the-top bawling really works here.I won't turn in my RCA set with Leontyne Price under Mehta or my EMI set with Callas under Karajan, but the present performance is memorable in its blood-and-guts way. Sonics are good but not great; ditto the conducting of Schippers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally! Or not...","review":"At first glance, this toy looks uber awesome. Makes you wanna buy it... Well, lets look over it from my persepective, before hand.First off, her make-up. I think MGA was going for the new-wave/mod looking pop star. Or, so I hope. I think they went a tad over board with that. I mean, checkered lips? But the make-up looks very nice. No big problems there.Secondly, comes Cloe's hair. Meh, it's pigtails. What can you do?And next, the fashion. It's debatable. They took that modern look to a whole new level. Let's just give them credit for that, and move on.Last, is her over all appearence. She matches and there's none of that classic Bratz \\"over-exposure\\". I'm not a big fan of pop stars or high-tech futuristic looking stuff, so this doll isn't my cup of tea. That's my opinion, take it or leave it.Thanks for your time. If you get this doll, enjoy it for what it's got.

One X is a pleasant surprize. Even better than their first album, there is not one bad song on it.If you've heard \\"Animal I have Become\\" on the radio and liked it, GET THE ALBUM! \\"Animal I have Become\\" is a very good song but there are some even better songs on the album.The best are \\"On My Own\\", \\"Over and Over\\", and \\"Get Out Alive\\" - All catchy, very nice melodies. That said, nearly every song on this album is catchy (with the exception possibly of \\"One X\\" - the title song, which is probably my least favorite track. I still like it, though).Yeah, it's nothing overwhelming revolutionary but if you're a fan of Breaking Benjamin, Seether, Shinedown, Hinder, Seven Wiser, even Hoobastank, you'll probably love this album.

Usually I buy two or three of the songs I like off of an album to save myself some money, but this was a great album. It's powerful lyrics, heavy riffs and overall full sound just blew me away at first listen. I have it in my car, and I haven't taken it out in over a week even when my total drive time is two hours a day. I am so impressed with the way they've matured and haven't sold out at all. A great rock album, one that I keep suggesting to all my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid (Not Sloppy) Seconds","review":"For a second album, these guys didn't go out and write one good track surrounded by the musical equivalent of rat turds! These Canucks got it right! They didn't change their formula too much from the last disc, and that's ok, at least they didn't try to expand their horizons and ruin everything like so many bands do while second guessing themselves on the sophomore record. This album has less standout tracks and more consistency instead. The first album started to have a slight fizzle while the 2nd remains strong throughout. I would definitely buy this album again. This is one of the few good rock albums coming out amongst all the bling-blings, what-what's, and one hit wonders that will last as long as a camera flash and be just as memorable."},{"rating":"2","title":"CD NUMBER 2 JUST AS GOOD!!!","review":"LOVE THE CD, ROCKS HARD BUT DEPRESSING LYRICS.

I got the album and I liked it pretty well. When I heard that they were releasing their second album I got real excited and couldn't wait to hear there new stuff. They added a band member, changed their look, but they kept the catchy rocking tunes that I knew I could count on them for. \\"Animal I Have Become\\" is an awesome tune, and a great first single for the album. They have matured since the last record, in their writing, and the whole atmosphere of the songs. Some of my favorite songs off the album are...\\"Pain\\", \\"Riot\\", \\"Over and Over\\", and \\"Gone Forever\\". I am only giving the album a 4 out of 5 because I think they will only continue to get better and that this is not their best yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor cd","review":"If you are going to be in a rock band at least learn how to play the drums.

Pain is the worst song i have heard yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Lyrics","review":"The band is excellent. They are good musicians and play tightly together. The problem is the lyrics are awful. This is nothing less than nightmares set to music. If you have these same thoughts running through your head, seek some professional psychiatric help. Absolutely not recommended for young listeners. Parents you are warned. No wonder the record industry is on the ropes."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre at best.","review":"What's with all the 4 and 5 star ratings? I bought this album after reading all the great reviews and although its bearable, it's not mindblowing.This is standard rock fare of the Nickleback variety: No originality, average riffs, okay vocals but terrible asinine lyrics that are so obvious and cheesy it's laughable, (for example track 2 'this life is filled with hurt when happiness doesn't work?') This is bad 9th grade poetry, All the songs follow the same themes of loss, pain and despair and none of it rings true or connects on any emotional level.This is not a bad album but there's so much better music out there. If you are thinking of buying this album, I recommend you try before you buy or at least seek out albums by bands such as Dead Letter Circus, Butterfly Effect, Chevelle, Cog, Grinspoon, Karnivool, Shihad, 36 Crazyfists, A Perfect Circle etc. There is so much more original music out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"???","review":"I hate bands that have a kickass debut cd and then suck after that.

I just hope the next one demonstrates a little more evolution of their musical ability."},{"rating":"2","title":"One awesome CD","review":"I have their first CD and love it.

All the songs on it kick a**."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophmore Slump","review":"After waiting a few years to hear their follow up album, i was disappointed to find that the driving anthems that made their first album so good were gone. Animal I have become is the closest song to their old album.....other songs like over and over are good but lack the intensity of home, just like u and other songs. If you like the new sound try breaking benjamins, their melodies are much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good CD at all...","review":"Animal I Have Become is the only worth while song on the whole CD (in my opinion, of course).

If you are familiar with Four tet, or fridge, you've probably come to expect beautiful electronic arrangements and interesting drum programming.

The CD is worth the price simply for one or two tracks, but as a whole the CD is one of those must have CD's that could easily escape ever being heard unless re-released.This album sounds a little less electronic and a little less involved than some other four tet releases, but the songs are still very interesting, original and well produced.I gave it four instead of five because it is not mind blowing.

It leads you from one emotion to another from the funny photo \\"Cheating\\" to the warm, and cozy \\"Home\\". From the poem \\"Cuttings\\" that is endearing and calming to \\"Second Opinion\\" that resonates with anguish, anger and regret. Viggo leaves you hungry and wanting to know more. If you are buying this book just because you are a Lord of the Rings/Aragorn fan, then you will be disappointed, this book has nothing to do with the actor and everything to do with the artist...the man. However, you won't learn much about Viggo, for like the Loch Ness monster he stays shrouded in mist, elusive, always just out of reach to the reader. If you keep an open mind, tho you may just learn something unexpected about yourself.

Not only is this a book of some of Viggo's work, it also comes with a CD with Viggo reading some of his work and it just adds to the wonder of this man.

Under the magic of movies, there is a man named Viggo Mortensen who happens to be an actor, along with a painter, a poet, and an individual who encourages others to think, read and be honest with themselves. This book is about modern art, words and truth. Not a pretty face, or a mindless photo hound. This book can provoke thought, appreciation and most of all, inspire you to become creative in whatever media suits you. Just when you think you've seen each frame clearly, you will find additional depth and subtle nuances that entrance. Recommended for those who appreciate art, poetry, and who want to think.

It is a very long book and well worth reading, because the book transcends its time."},{"rating":"1","title":"About the packaging","review":"This review has little to do with the book itself but more to do with how the product was received.

There is need for editing. I noticed misspellings throughout the novel and a particular odd thing: where the word'die' ought to be, the word 'the' was instead. This occurred during the barricade section of the novel. Strange. I know this is a English translation of a French work, but that shouldn't be missed.Powerful work. Highly recommended. Tighten up on editing."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a sublimely beautiful book!","review":"I have seen and collected movies of Les Miserables, including the musical. I love them all, and longed to have the time to read the book. I finally ordered it. What a beautiful story!While all movies start the story with Jean Valjean having his soul \\"bought for God\\" by Monsignor Bienvenu, the book actually starts with the life of the Monsignor and spends about 50 pages on it before introducing Jean Valjean. Then it spends time in these main characters to make the reader really know them,even become intimate with them,before they meet. The same weaving of lives together are seen with Javert, Fantine, and Cosette.This book is so rich in life! It has so many moving scenes that will stir your heart! Many dialoges are so intellectually engaging! It is a beautiful blend of piercing ideas and deep emotions, of contrast and harmony, it is a masterwork of life!How could I live so long without reading it? To read this book is to live!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Things To Consider With Denny Translation","review":"By his own admission Norman Denny annexed 2 long digressive stretches of the novel and made some minor abridgments in the text. So it is not technically an unabridged translation. A good start if you haven't read the book is the Fahnstock and MacAfee translation from 1987. It is a faithful and complete translation based upon the Wilbour translation of 1862. There is great anticipation for the Christine Donougher translation; and I hope hers will be a more faithful translation than Julie Rose's translation from 2008."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abridged = Major Plot Points Deleted!","review":"I picked up this abridged version because the original is very lengthy. At about 50 pages in, something strange happened. One chapter ended with Fantine getting a job at the factory, and the next chapter began with her on her deathbed! I pulled out the full version and noticed they cut 6 chapters from the original book and in so doing, completely eliminated her story, which changes the entire course of the main character's life! This is far from a \\"sensitive abridgment\\" as the cover claims!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"I admit to having been skeptical when I read accounts that this was one of the greatest novels of all time, but upon completing Les Miserables I'm inclined to believe that this sentiment does not go far enough. There are many novels which are entertaining--few which make you want to be a better man. Les Miserables is a beautiful story told in a manner that is both insightful and inspiring. It is quite a bit longer than the average modern novel, but upon reaching the end you will find yourself wishing for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Denny is the one","review":"If you are going to read Les Mis, read the Norman Denny translation. I had lost my Denny book half way through and picked up another translation. Just not the same read at all. Had to go and find another Denny translation. It makes all the difference.I disliked the musical but came to the novel Les Mis after finally reading Gone With The Wind and learning that the Confederate troops read Les Mis (Lee's Miserables)in their camps. (The first English translation was in 1862, months after the novel was originally published). The two books compliment each other, as well as being great snapshots of history. I couldn't help wondering if Margaret Mitchell didn't have Les Mis in mind when she wrote GWTW. And of course, no movie compares to the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"are you kidding me, amazon??!","review":"this is NOT the \\"stunning new edition translated by prizewinner Christine Donougher\\" but rather a tired edition that came out in 1976! the ONLY reason that i gave it 2 stars is because, come on, it IS les mis! still, this is an instant return. i already own two superior translations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horibble Version!","review":"I actually purchased the Barnes and Noble Classic Version which had almost 900 pages and me being only 14 said, \\"Ok, I'll buy that one,\\" because even though it was abridged it couldn't possibly be that abridged. But, when I got my package today, THIS one came and I was shocked to only see 400 pages and I was very dissapointed. Immediately i turned to the front pages and seen that the chapters were named differently it was large print in a way, and it left out the whole part about the Bishop of Digne, which is just repulsive, and i couldn't believe they did that. So beware because this one really chops up Victor Hugo's work, and i wouldn't even waste your time with this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LES MISERABLES","review":"What I read so far, its great.

This book was very slow to start off with but as time progressed, so did the book. This book starts off in France during the book. Jean Valjean is the main character that has to go through life under the identy of many different people. He is on the run from antagonist Javert, who is the law enforcer in France during this time. This book was very popular for many reasons. One is that it is written by one of the most famous, and in my opinion the most brilliant writers of his time(Victor Hugo). He is an amazing writer.During this book he shows through the characters what life was like while he wrote the book. He expressed his opinion of the society and government of France. This book was many twists and turns, you never know what is going to happen next.

It is a wonderful story with great meaning. The story really makes you think about what you take for granted when life offers so many opportunities. A wonderful story of loss to fortune and from hate to forgiveness and selfishness to love. It epitomizes the Jaycee Creed of:That faith in God gives meaning and purpose to human life;That the brotherhood of man transcends the sovereignty of nations;That economic justice can best be won by free men through free enterprise;That government should be of laws rather than of men;That earth's great treasure lies in human personality;And that service to humanity is the best work of life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good start!","review":"This is truly one of my favorite stories!! Although not the full-length version, this version is very well done and would do well for any trip or just day-to-day commutes! I wish this was in full-length with the same reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Les Miserables is the most enthralling book I have ever read","review":"This book is fantastic. After discovering the musical, I decided to read the book and am very glad I did. Marius, Cosette, and Eponine are involved in a heart-wrenching love triangle. I was happy for Marius and Cosette, (how can you not be?) but I felt so close to Eponine. She was so brave, being in love and knowing she was not getting Marius's love in return, yet she gives him the ultimate sacrifice. I think she displays the true meaning of love. The first time Marius and Cosette kiss is the most emotional scene I have ever read, and I read a lot. Eponine is definitely my favorite character, because she makes the most of what she has, and tries to improve herself while being held down by her family and poverty. I also thought it was ironic, the way Cosette begins as a poor orphan while Eponine has everything, then the tables are turned. I recommend this book to anyone looking for a bit of history and an emotional roller coaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too abridged","review":"I love the story of Les Mis. But this book left out what I cansider to be important details and leaves the reader a bit confused with the some of the events. I would suggest this version to someone who wishes to be merely introduced to the story. Not to a serious reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"does not live up to the original","review":"After reading the unabridged edition that was loaned to me, I decided to purchase this edition. If you have never read this story before, you owe it to yourself to plunge into the original text. This abridged edition leaves out important character-related text, and just skims the surface of what is a beautiful story. This version does not leave you feeling much for the characters. I will take more time choosing the next Les Mis book and make sure it tells the whole story. This book seems to have been written with the movie in mind, and just doesn't do Victor Hugo's work justice. The original story is perhaps the greatest novel ever written. Shame on Charles Wilbour for dissecting Hugo's work like this!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do they do this? WHY?!?","review":"No one has a way with words quite like Victor Hugo. He has a completely unique way of setting up a situation and an exceptional knack for coming up with complex, yet enjoyable plots. Les Miserables, his most ambitious work, is arguably one of the greatest literary accomplishments ever and I truly loved it.This, however, would be lost to any of the readers to this edition, b/c they are not truly reading Hugo's great work, they are reading a version that has been nipped and tucked to fit into the publishers' idea of a good book; that is, one short enough to keep today's average, short-attention-spanned readers from becoming bored. In reading this book, you are admitting to the publisher that you are too lazy and dumb to grasp real literature or appreciate beautiful use of language when you see it. If you want to read a great book, read the original, don't read this censored rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reader Beware!","review":"I LOVE the book Les Miserables but found the unabridged version to be a bit daunting. I was really excited to read this abridged version by James K. Robinson, but was thoroughly disappointed. One of my favorite characters, Fantine, is COMPLETELY left out of this version! She is introduced when she gives Cosete to her new guardians, and then the next time she's mentioned, she is in the hospital dying. Where's the meat of the book? I would NOT recommend this abridgment; I'm on the hunt for a new one."},{"rating":"2","title":"This novel changed me.","review":"The courage, sacrifice, and simple kindness of Jean ValJean, as revealed by Victor Hugo, had a profound influence on my character as I prepared to face the world. Read for the first time at the age of 17, I was moved to tears quite often before I finished. (pretty unusual for a young man bent on stoicism!) ValJean is a criminal who finds redemption through the kindness of a priest, and his life is forever changed. He develops a superior sense of morality, but never a moral sense of superiority. He is a hero.In my opinion, this book was Hugo's greatest creation. Because of its popularity, a large number of bad translations and abridged editions have begun to circulate. Be careful what you buy. In my opinion, the older the better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, Best classic, By Far","review":"This is a great book, I am a young avid reader, I would not recommend it to young people because only few young people (such as myself) will be able to understand this book, most young people don't read or do read but only little and not properly.This book is one of the best books I've read, I only recommend this to good readers that will understand this.

I brought this home and began thumbing through the table of contents--something I should have done in the store--No mention of Waterloo! That sparked my thorough review of the book. I was aghast.

This book is a gutted and dried fish."},{"rating":"2","title":"C'est magnifique!","review":"I read this book prior to the release of the motion picture, so I would be able to tell how much they had altered it. I read the complete and unabridged version, and WOW!! I could not believe how much I liked it. After you get past the language, and the length (I had to keep changing positions while I was reading because the book was so heavy), it is a really good book. You start rooting for Marius and Cosette to get together and I even pride myself on the fact that I guessed that the neighbors were the tavern keepers. Once you get into the hundreds, it is impossible to stop, it gets so interesting. And the little side books about the nuns, Waterloo, and the bishop, while not pivotal, are really interesting too, especially the one about the nuns. READ IT!! I'm generally speaking a JD Salinger kind of person, but I loves Les Mis.

So when my wife and I wanted to get an abridged version for her to read in English, we bought this one. On skimming through the book, and maybe it's just us, but we found no trace of Fantine's story before she ended up in Jean Valjean's care, or of Jean Valjean's rescue of Cosette from the Thénardiers, which are both very moving parts. If those are missing, there are probably other very touching and important parts missing. We plan on taking our version back and getting the full version. It would be better to just skip past the sections that talk about the convent, the battle of Waterloo, the sewer system, etc., because they're wasy to skip, and the rest of the book will still be there. Honestly, Les Mis is probably the best book I've ever read, but it has to be purchased in it's full format to really be truly appreciated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beats replacing the whole thing","review":"My wife pulled the cord out of the original headset.

The Second and Third get recorded relatively often, the first not so much. I bought this mainly for the First. The Second, for string orchestra, has an optional trumpet part in the last movement, not assigned here. That doesn't bother me as much as the level of playing. These, to be sure, aren't easy to play, but Plasson and his band are downright sloppy. Honegger requires rhythmic precision.

Phillip Ko is a Tibetan Lama, Kam Kong is a Mongolian, and the other guy is a Muslim. Helping them out is a masked man played by Yu Tien Lung (the villain fromSnake-Crane Secret). The legendary Lo Lieh also has a role and Yueh Hua has a small part.Basically the story involves traitors and a lot of assassination attempts. There is also a Russian army causing trouble.The fighting is only average which is kind of a shame with all these great stars on hand.

Shoell's take on the aftermath of Psycho is that American film making in the post Psycho era was able to become more graphic thanks in part to Psycho's overwhelming success at the box office. Shoell backs up his claim with analysis of multi-genre Hollywood films from the 60s on. Most notable are his criticism of the Hollywood western and television violence. Horror fans will be delighted to revisit the golden age of the stalk and slash film as Shoell highlights that era's top pictures. Shoell gives an organized, interesting, and carefully rendered account on 25 years of shock cinema. It is interesting, and informative reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"the beautiful, dark, serenity and lustrous, shadowed, Gothic brilliance of the haunting melodies in this album has no equal! its simply a must have for those who truly understand the passion of an entrancing Gothic serenade!.....glorious and dark at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A EXTREMELY original take on winter music","review":"I stumbled across Nox Arcana when looking at Midnight Syndicate Cds (which is also amazing) and I completely fell in love with Nox...

I should add that I say all this with a sinking heart, as I had very high hopes for her career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boland's Latest a Disappointment","review":"Eavan Boland has made a lasting contribution to modern poetry in English. Her earlier volumes, excluding The Lost Land, explored themes of domesticity, women's creativity, and Irish nationalism in language both lyrical and tough-minded. Her latest collection seems flat and uninspired, as if she is imitating herself. As if she is thinking too much about what she wants to say and not letting her own poetic voice lead the way. Could the problem be that she is now spending too much time in the U.S. as a tenured academic at Stanford? Whatever the cause, I hope she returns to her earlier passion and power."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake Irish Poetry","review":"In this most pretentiously titled book, Boland continues to ask us to believe that she speaks for women everywhere and that she has something significant to say about Irish history and politics. It's no accident that she teaches and lives in America--in Ireland we're having none of her. Here she is deeply unpopular, especially among the younger generation of female poets who look to more innovative writers for their models. The problem is that Boland shamelessly courts the establishment with her predictable and traditionalist domestic (domesticated) verse while at the same time striking psuedo-revolutionary academic postures. The poems themselves are flat, frightened and derivative. This is very poor work indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"I'm a fan of Cannonball Adderley, I really am.

Shatner gives a surprisingly restrained and effective performance, which makes you wonder what he could have done if he hadn't wasted most of his career making all those Star Trek movies.

I figured right, as both movies were cool. When I was watching this movie, I had a bad case of the creepy-crawlies and got really itchy.

I'm a glutton for punishment, I guess. The film stars William Shatner and Tiffany Bolling as well as approximately 5,000 assorted spiders including tarantulas, wolf spiders, bola spiders, and a few others I won't bother to look up on Wikipedia.The plot is essentially a ripoff of \\"Jaws\\" with some science fiction thrown in for good measure: a town is threatened with mutant spiders who've somehow developed higher than usual levels of toxicity due to illegal waste dumping near their desert homes. The spiders, somehow realizing that humans are to blame, attack the town, its residents, and all of the town's livestock and pets.The acting is passable and the special effects aren't totally bad.

An actually quite intelligent movie that has good special effects for its time, this is very entertaining movie that doesn't cop out during its entire running time.While William Shatner is known for giving outrageous and campy performances, e.g. T.J. Hooker, The Wrath of Khan (Khan! KHAN!!!), he gives the ultimate B-movie performance. The supporting cast is less capable, but being the name, Shatner entertains like he is supposed to.The spiders are the real draw though, and they're actually quite well done, but nothing like the realistic spiders in a movie from today like Eight Legged Freaks.Overall, this is highly entertaining shlock that will be sure to give you enjoyment.

I got an XL and I normally comfortably wear an L in any hiking shorts or pants. The XL was so small I needed to fit in a different belt. Also, articulation is very poor compared to hiking shorts or any kind of real kilt, if I try to step higher than two feet at a time it binds up pretty badly.On the plus sides it was cheap, and it is very light fabric.

These beliefs are limits to be transcended.\\" One creates one's own truth and may or may not subject it to tests which may or may not confirm it, so that even one's objectivity is subjective.

It was a little rough to start for about a chapter, since there were so many characters that had to be introduced. However, once the story started about chapter 3, things really took off and got interesting. I liked this tale! It was a bit clever. Although I did not suspect whom the killer was correctly, I kind of figured out how it was done before the end.

Its characters are intriguing, and the solution to the crime is amazingly clever. Agatha Christie establishes an atmosphere of foreboding in the very first chapter, as the likeable Mr. Satterthwaite (who here fills the role of the absent Captain Hastings) sits on the terrace of the Crows Nest resort, remarking on the personalities and the actions of the people around him, who include the retired actor Sir Charles Cartwright and the respected doctor Sir Bartholemew Strange. From here, the novel takes the form of a \\"tragedy in three acts,\\" with a new murder in each act and a series of clues, both real and \\"staged.\\" While some readers may be disappointed to find that the great Poirot is absent from the novel for chapters at a time, there is good reason for this -- and he does indeed play a starring role in the \\"final act.\\" I believe that anyone who loves Christie and Poirot will love THREE ACT TRAGEDY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Britten: Saint Nicolas/A Ceremony of Carols - Robert Tear, Sir David Willcocks, King's College Choir, Cambridge (Purchased on 12","review":"CD is defective.

He re-did a lot of his older works, and took time to record some new, like \\"I Must Go\\" and \\"Someone You Need\\", the best duet I ever heard him play, with Duncan Shiek (if he did before at all). The most outstanding tracks for me are \\"No One Is To Blame\\", \\"Hide And Seek\\" and the earlier mentioned \\"I Must Go\\" and \\"Someone You Need\\", although every track of this album cannot be skipped in your cd-player.Never heard an artist play such a different sound compared to his older works and make it sound greater than ever before! Truly the Best Howard of All Times in my opinion.For the Dutch fans, of wich I'm one: the best point probably is that it is sold in most recordstores (even Free Record Shop has it stored); I think, this is because of his appearance on the Ducth Night Of The Proms festivals.

From the classic \\"If Your Poison Gets You\\" through the numbers co-written with punker Reid Paley (\\"I'm Not Dead, I'm In Pittsburgh\\" is superb), all the way to the end, this album is stunningly satisfying to repeat listens.This is not a new Catholics album played by other people, this is a unique entity. Music legends Al Kooper, Levon Helm and Steve Cropper all feature with amazing result, but this is still definitely a Frank Black album. Take a listen to the musical progression and lyrics of \\"Kiss my ring\\" if you doubt.Then, just for fun, listen to any of the instruments individually, in any song.Perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"This ain't your Pixies Black","review":"If you liked Honeycomb as much as I did, you're in for a treat with these 27 tracks that rock in a slightly different way than we're used to hearing Frank.This is much more good old fashioned country rock.

The characters are funny, and the style is pretty good if you don't count the stunted switches between narrators. The plot was definitely interesting enough to keep me, but the ending leaves much to be desired. In fact, half of this book bugs me to no end, and despite them being pretty decent characters, what they agree to will make you furious. However, knowing that romance novels generally have happy endings, I persevered and was disappointed when Judy Markey completely dropped the ball. In the very last seconds of the book, she patched up everything with minimal cohesiveness. In other words, I couldn't imagine the characters doing what they ended up doing. Without a more drawn out ending, this book is not worth the time.Read it (or listen to the cassette) if you have little else to do, but you're better off with a more stable romance novelist like Jayne Ann Krentz or going and renting yourself a romantic comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Father doesn't know best","review":"The beginning of the book is interesting and promising. And then it falls apart. The main actors are not believable and fall out of character. Nothing in Charlie's previous life indicates that he will turn into a clutz and go ape about a baby that may not even be his. Nobody halfway sober would sign the kind of agreement he did. And Lacy, that superwoman with a 17-year old daughter, completely negates her baby.Life is not like this, and no humor or satire will make it so.

Just the sounds of the wolf pack recorded hear allows you to recognize the unique structure of a wolf family, I agree with others in the fact that it can bring you to tears in its aurora of beauty. The music tied into this CD also creates that certian atmosphere, where at one moment you want to just sit back and listen, and in another you want to run free in the wild with the wolves.

He also can't quote film lines accurately which is a pretty serious failing when we're talking about films available on video or seen regularly on AMC or TCM. Yes, Louvish has done research but, like his equally lame Marx Brothers bio, the research is spoiled by a poor, self-indulgent style.Skip this poorly written excuse for a biography, search out a copy of Ronald Fields' \\"W.C.

I am currently reading Night Kills (another one of her early suspense novels--it is excellent, also) this is such a talented author! I am tempted to write her website begging her to write more like these!

I have never had them returned. For months she would make up crazy excuses at to why she couldn't send them back to me, blameing others for her suposed difficulty. The title soon was discontinued and the price of replacement went through the roof. I have not been able to replace it nor the other AR movies that I sent to her. I have since seen this title for sale from sellers for exorbitant prices from Arizona and wondered if they weren't mine.

I feel that Natalie (Reeves) was an unhappy person in general and her brother happened to be handy and easily manipulated into their affair. When she decides to move on Richard (Owen) is having none of it. Sinclair (Alan Rickman) is oblivious at first, but comes across quite ominus when he becomes aware what is going on. Due to the content it is DEFINITELY not recommended for kids, but if you can remember it's only a movie and they are not real brother and sister, it's a really good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"I recently purchased this shaver and I am less than thrilled.

I find this book to be a treasure of good mathamatic formulas for designing higher order filters.Among that, his experiments inside the book complete each chapter in describing active filters for each example given in the book. Even though this title is out of print, I can tell that some of the best books written, not just for active filters, but for electronics engineering have been out of print for many years. So for anyone interested in designing active filters, this book is exceptionally good, and easy to understand from cover to cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monkey Butt Sex","review":"This is the infamous \\"Monkey Butt Sex\\" storyline, opening with an entire chapter of proto-human sex and violence. If Monkey Butt Sex is the type of thing that might bother you, you may want to spend your money elsewhere.This opening is either an homage to Kubrick and Clarke's 2001, a parody of 2001 or just plain derivative.The Monkey Butt Sex does serve the story, which tracks the first superhumans to the present, so it's not actually gratuitous, although it is probably more graphic than needed. But the story is itself somewhat lacking -- slow paced, poor dialog, and repetitive. Characterization is flat. It is not one of the high points of the series.The art is great, as you would expect from Oeming -- stylized, with lots of hard black lines. Monkey Butt Sex never looked so good.Fans of the series will want to pick this up because it leads into the next book, but new readers will want to avoid it -- it doesn't hold up on its own, it barely holds up within the context of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another solid arc in this great series","review":"Benis and Oeming's Powers is one of the best series out there today, dealing with cops who work on superhero-related crimes. Ruthlessly graphics, often funny, and always engaging, it's a must read for me whenever a new trade paperback is released.Forever is nice installment of the Powers series, adding the overall mythos these creators have built. Forever is a story arc that reveals who the main character, Christian Walker, truly is, while outlining a superhero rivalry that has gone on, well, forever. It does not rise to the level of the last tome, The Sellouts, but it does manage to be a good story of revenge and loss, adding new layers to an already great series.

Heyer is the best of the historical romance novelists; her research makes all her romances ring true, no matter what the period.Rather than the Drawing Room and Comedy of Manners of many of her Regency romances, Beauvallet moves.

Things are more on the surface and you really don't get any insight into the characters.

There is no way to fix the problem, unless you buy a print head perhaps, which will cost the same amount as a new printer.

For whatever reason the ink heads completely clogged and no ink could get through. The customer service was helpful, but I was disappointed to find that Epson has no toll free customer service phone number, so when you have an issue, you have to pay to call and get it fixed. However since they replaced it at no cost and very little hassle, that was only a minor inconvience.

This uses ink from all cartridges even if only one is clogged.Additionally, there is a cleaning pad built into the printer that can only handle a certain amount of wasted ink.

The prints from the C82 are a disappointment. They are flat and without the tonal range of my less expensive, but now broken, 740i.I cannot tell if it is the durabright inks or what. I want to return mine, and I hope I can.The noise it makes when loading the paper is SO LOUD that I thought I had broken it. I don't know why it has to make such a noise. PLUS, it is very expensive to buy inks. The C80 color inks do not work in this one, but the C80 black ink does. I guess the waterproof selling point is not for me. I miss the impact of a truly wonderful glossy print. This printer does not amaze. It disappoints. I truly wish it were otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this printer.","review":"The ink is expensive and continually clogs. You need to waste time and ink trying to clean the heads until eventually that doesn't even work anymore. Mine quit working for good right after I spent $80 on a new set of cartridges.

This one is the exception. As other reviewers noted, it worked fine for about a year with light use. Then the print head simply died. The other HUGE problem with this printer is that somehow, the ink dries out unless you use it every other day or so. The cartridges, all Epson cartridges, dried up on me far too quickly. I was replacing ink every three to four weeks, with very little printing. Unacceptable. I've had such a bad experience with this printer that it's put me off of the Epson brand entirely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another broken C82","review":"I bought my C82 in 2/2003, Yesterday I changed the black print cartridge and black stopped working ran the nozzle cleaner utility and nothing.

It's already got incredibly clogged print heads and I have only used the oh-so-precious Epson ink they want you to use.

However, I've had nothing but trouble with maintenance on this printer. I've had banding issues that were only sometimes solved by cleaning the print heads.

And now, I'm running into the clogged print-head problem that Epson claims it can't do anything about.It was nice... while it lasted. Mine is a year old, and I'm replacing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for text (with photos) when it works, on regular or bright white papert","review":"The quality for text and photos on bright white paper is very good. BUT, do not expect a long life from the heads, do not buy many cartridges for on-hand spares. It quits rather quickly and in a matter of days its all over. I emptied most of the cartridges trying to clean the heads, only white paper during printing. Mine did print yellow before the cartridge got nearly empty. Goodbye Epson C82, I feel like shipping it to Epson collect one way........ Oh yes, the HP 5550 is very good, prints very fast in draft quality (uses little ink) and good enough if you need to do a lot of printing with text and photos. Excellent photos on glossy paper with the photo cartridge."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, when it works","review":"I bought my original C82 mid 2003 from amazon.com. Around the beginning of 2004 the printer stopped working. I would only print blank pages and all the nozzle checks and head cleaning in the world wouldn't fix it. I even changed the ink cartridges to no avail. I called tech support and they sent me a new C82. Well that one just died (Nov. 2004) and when I called Epson they told me they only warranty their exchanges for 30 days. I was mad to say the least. I went through their hoops and finally got someone to exchange it for a different model. Definitely do some research on the web before even thinking about buying this model."},{"rating":"1","title":"What good is a printer that doesn't print?","review":"If you are going to buy this printer make sure you use it often.

On a positive but non-redeeming note, I never had a paper jam with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT....while it lasted","review":"I bought this just over a year ago in 2003, and today, my printer heads clogged up permanetly. I cleaned them about 10 times, but that didn't solve the problem. What happened was my black and cyan cartridges were almost empty so I went to AAFES and bought a new black ($29.95) and cyan ($9.95) cartridge. I come home to replace them and installed them. I printed and all that printed was magenta and yellow!! The monitor showed the black and cyan were full!! So now, I go to test with old cartridges to see if I was sold an old cartridge, but my magenta just ran out b/c of all the cleaning. I looked on Epson's site and the owners troubleshoot manual and FOUND NOTHING that solved the problem. I also read other people's printer heads are worn out. I bought this printer for $149.00 from AAFES (Army & Air Force Exchange Service). It did produce great prints, but I bet yours will last about a year or two.

The Epson C82 is that horrible.I'm on my second C82 - the first one completely stopped printing after 10 months, so they sent a \\"new\\" one (\\"new\\" to Epson means refurbished). I received it in mid-December and after printing 10 pages, my banding problems were back (lines through the document and areas w/o ink). So, I called them again but was told there was nothing they could do til I ran diagnostics 9 times in a row. I've done that but now need to reach Tech Support during their very limited hours.

After about a year of moderate use, the print head cleaner ink hose broke. This is apparently a VERY common failure mode for this printer.

But, the C82 has the print head built-in rather than part of a new cartrige. What that means is that WHEN the print head dries it will clog rendering the printer useless. Repair costs almost as much as the printer itself. Use Epson cartridges, follow the installation directions to the tee and you still can get a print head clog, air bubbles in the cartridge, I was told. Do an Internet search on 'Epson C82 not printing' and you will meet those who have already bought the C82. Epson's recommendation to me was to buy new cartridges, $60, then a cleaning kit, $10, that and a lot of my time.

Little did I know it clunks like a Mack truck when it loads paper. I was replacing an older 740 because it was so loud when it prints, and I wanted to get individual cartridges, as it was annoying that the 740 would stop printing if one color ran out, but still had plenty ink left in the other two colors--even if you were printing a black text only item! A second problem is I like to turn everything on/off with one switch. The 740 would allow this (although the documentation said \\"don't\\"), but the new C82 will NOT come back on when external power is applied, you must hit the on switch. My setup happens to have that switch in an awkward location. This was my fourth (and last) Epson--I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF MONEY","review":"Horrible product.

At month 5 started experiencing the \\"dry outs\\" that others mention. At first a quick change of the lowest level ink would help if head cleaning didn't work. (that's $15-18 for each cartridge changed). It finally got to the point that if the printer sat idle for 10 days or more, all 4 inks would clog. Repeated efforts at head cleaning did not help. As it is the colored inks are expensive when you buy sets. Went back to HP, this time the 5150. Along with my HP 952C and HP 5110, I am very happy once again. Fewer component inks to buy and reliable everytime."},{"rating":"1","title":"This printer is garbage","review":"I've had the printer almost a year and it worked perfectly.

I'd guess we've printed less than 40 sheets in 6 months - it's just so cranky. Once the paper finally feeds, it usually works fine from there. Something in turning it off and back on for the next print fouls the feeding.Secondly - I've never gotten anything reasonable for printing photo-quality on photo paper. It's always very gritty. Sadly, printing on plain paper usually comes out better - despite trying nearly every combination of \\"paper setting\\" for the photo paper.I bought this printer through Office Depot - they jerked me around selling me different paper and offering advice until I ran out of warranty.

In general worked ok for the first few months. I had problems with the ink status working and finally gave up but worked ok for the most part. But the real issue is the heads plug up and the head cleaning process will not clear them. So, unless you are still under waranty you will spend more to get them cleaned than the unit costs. Eventually this will happen to you. Don't replace the ink cartridge as the trouble shooting suggests as you will just be throwing your money away. I almost forgot to mention that you would think the ink cartidges had gold in them (very expensive). Finally be aware that if you are out of warranty you will need to pony up $10 just to speak with a technical rep. I recommend you stay away from Epson. I have had good luck with HP and Lexmark.

This printer has been reduced to a piece of junk! It is constantly clogging and makes a terrible noise when pulling paper through (like it's self destructing).I've own three Epson printers and this I assure you will be the last one.

When used for the first time during a session, it takes awhile for a sheet to feed. I hear gears spinning but nothing happening for maybe 30 or more secs. I am waiting for this one to quit anytime.

Called Invicta and was told that this watch that did not have the number 9310 (but began with 98xxx) had a Automatic Swiss Movement. It is my third Invicta watch. It did not have a automotic Swiss movement. In fact, it was a battery operated movement. The crystal was chipped, and I was so disgusted, I discarded the watch.I ordered another (different style)with an automatic (Japanese 21 Jewel) movement. It works fine and is a great watch for the price.Very disappointed with this shipment and the seller for the deception. I could have gone to J.C. Penney and purchased the same watch for a couple of dollars more.Lesson learned: Be careful and look at the detailed description of the watch.

I have had the watch for a couple of weeks now and it keeps time perfectly and has withstood my constant abuse. I am really hard on a watch due to my avocations but this one doen't even have a single scratch up to this point. This is my second Invicta and I like this one even more than my previous more expensive version. It's simple and doesn't have a lot of useless functions that I don't need. I didn't realize it when I bought it that it is a Rolex look-a-like but after receiving several compliments I did a little research and found that it does in fact mirror a Submariner that costs several thousand dollars. The little bubble over the day of the month is a bit worrisome because it protrudes away from the face but I say this a great deal for the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible experience","review":"I bought this watch as a short term replacement while my Citizen was being repaired. This watch is horrible. The crown is not screw down, as advertised and it constantly pulls out. As a result I'm always loosing time and changing the date. I cannot rely on it to keep time because of the crown issue. Since I am a nurse and have to keep track of patient medication times, functionality is mandatory! Good grief. It is a watch after all. When I looked at having it fixed under warranty, the Invicta company wants $28.00 just for S&H; to look at it. Yes - you get to send them $28 just to get the defective watch fixed under warranty!Oh, and you may wonder why I simply did not return it? Once it has been worn, it is not returnable.

However, the text is rather slim for some of the latter entries, and I must say that I question the artist's choice of subjects - few creatures in here are truly alien, and far too many are simply human!

This recording, is a must have along with his studio recordings. It rates up there with William Kapell's last recital performance of Chopin's 2nd Sonata (\\"Funeral March\\") which was performed live in Australia.I have heard this recording on records and was baffled when I listened to the CD recording for the first time. On the record version, Lipatti improvises several times: before playing the Bach Partita, and before the Mozart. On this CD, I don't hear those improvisations, which I'm told were an oldtradition of some pianists (I was once told Rubenstein did this at a recital and the listener was left wondering what A.R. was doing!). Regardless of improvisational omissions, I HIGHLY reccomend this recording. It leaves me with regret that Lipatti didn't live longer to bring about more fruits of his musical abillity.Did I mention that I LOVE this recording??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrifying","review":"How excited I was when I received this CD in the mail! How horrified I was when I put it in my CD player and pressed play! Despite all the pictures of John Wayne, Kim Darby, and Glen Campbell on the cover, this is NOT the True Grit soundtrack. It is instead \\"Elmer Bernstein conducts Themes from his Original Score.\\" The difference: The true movie soundtrack is among the biggest, most booming western music ever recorded. This CD is some of the weakest, cheesiest 60's/70's orchestra music that has survived until now. The grand True Grit themes sound perverse mixed into music that would be more at home in Our Man Flint. The only redeeming quality of this CD is that the last track is the actual recording of the theme song that is used in the movie. If not for that, this album would be a total waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the soundtrack - but a complete True Grit recording soon","review":"This album was \\"never\\" the original soundtrack recording but a disc of outlandishly \\"commercial\\" arrangements of thematic material from the film score. It therefore remains something of an oddity. Those wanting a faithful rendition of Elmer Bernstein's score wil be pleased to note that a recording of the entire score - every note of it - has now been made utilising the original manuscripts - with the original orchestrations by Leo Shuken and Jack Hayes - and is due for release on the Tadlow Music label in June 2006."},{"rating":"1","title":"Actual Score Available Elsewhere","review":"Some of the score is available recorded by Bernstein on a compilation recording he made in the 80's of his John Wayne western scores.

If you don't enjoy a narrative style book then this one isn't for you.

There was no magic in this book for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated","review":"The hype over this book is overrated. I love the australian bush and have knowledge of the species discussed but the content didn't do anything for me. The plot was tedious and the descriptions of the eucalypts were poor and boring. Where was the majesty of the bush? where was the feeling of crispness and friability? I truly don't know why this book won the Prime Ministers Literary award."},{"rating":"1","title":"A series of half-baked vignettes held together by a thread","review":"It can't be a good sign when you finally give up on a book 30 pages from the end. This book proves, like a John Fowles novel, that the writer holds all the cards. Give a reader a half-interesting tale to follow and they will follow because they want to know what happens in the end. Unfortunately, Bail doesn't come close to Fowles' skill as a story-teller.As other reviewers here have pointed out, the story -- if you can call it that -- seems to be little more than an endless series of half-baked vignettes that hang together only in the loosest sense of the word. They are meant to be evocative, or illustrative, of the central romance at the heart of the novel, but in the end they are just tiresome. One ends up feeling that the author structured the novel this way because he was too lazy to create a coherent and compelling whole."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eucalyptus","review":"Dreamy book, loved the analogies between the trees scientific names and human behaviour.

I had the most trouble believing 1) Ellen's father could get all the Eucalyptus species successfully growing on his property and 2)The surreal descriptions of the trees, which from a poetic perspective, are the best part of the story .In the end, I didn't like this novel. The ending was unresolved, anticlimaxed and irrelevant to the flow of the rest of the story. This is one novel where the trees are given far more poetry, colour and life than the 'wooden' human characters. I guess it's only right then that Nic Kidman will be playing the female lead the the cinematic adaptation."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst","review":"A book club of which I am a member picked this book as a selection due to the rave editorial and critical reviews. All six of the club members hated, yes, hated, this book. Some didn't even finish it. It may be interesting to an Australian botanist, but I can find little else in the tale to interest anyone else. The character of Ellen was so undeveloped, I didn't care what happened to her. The stories that her unnamed lover told her were uninteresting and left me very unsatisfied. Toward the end of the book I started skipping passages that talked of the Eucalyptus trees I was so fed up with the tedious and never ending description of these trees. I would never recommend this book to anyone, unless I really disliked them."},{"rating":"1","title":"A message.","review":"I gave this to my grandmother as a gift. After her death, it found its way back to me. Inside the front cover was a note stating: This is the most boring book I have ever read. I then read the book, thinking that with my fancy university education and all that I was bound to experience it differently. I'm afraid it didn't work for me either."},{"rating":"2","title":"A magical tale","review":"I read this book while living in Australia. I decided that while I was there, I wanted to discover more Australian authors and Murray Bail was at the top of my list. Anyone interested in learning more about Australian literature should read one of Bail's novels. Eucalyptus fuses fantasy with appreciation for a symbol of Australia: the eucalyptus. While the novel contains a message about acceptance - in this case a father's acceptance of his daughter's choices - it is not a particularly deep novel. Even so, the evocative writing carries the reader along for the ride effortlessly."},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing is pure junk","review":"It prints grainy when it does not misfeed.

But anyone who truely loves film, especially independent film, I think will appreciate it. I had never seen a Franois Ozon movie before, but now I plan to see every single one. Natacha Régnier and Jérémie Rénier give two of the best performances that I have seen recently and should be commended. The movie has a great dark look and feel to it.I think one of the main reasons I loved this movie was because it was kind of daring.

You've got to be musicial."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need to buy!!!!","review":"You haven't lived until you've gotten one of these suckers. I had a smaller stereo but this is so much better. You really have to hear to belive it. I got it when it was on sale for $130. I looked everyware for a good price for these and this was the best price. So if you need a stereo get this one it also works for a ipod."},{"rating":"1","title":"cannot recommend","review":"I bought this book for $1.00 at the used bookstore and it was overpriced at that. I normally like time travel stories but this one is not very good. It's dated and the writing is amateurish. Very unsatisfying but thankfully only 180 pages or so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This novella starts out great, but Tucker loses the thread about the second chapter. He doesn't even time up all the loose ends. Looks like he ran out of steam!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never shipped or even communicated!","review":"The terrible reseller never shipped or even communicated they were not going to ship, cut this clown off!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip Avaya's Products","review":"Anyone who purchases an Avaya product should get their head examined. They have all kinds of technical issues and the customer support is nonexistent. Save yourself a whole lot of frustration and just buy Cisco. Their products may still only be so-so but at least you can find someone to fix the problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you can, buy the original printing!","review":"The vast majority of the people buying this book are probably buying it for class (like me) and have no say in the matter, so there's really no point in discussing the book itself. I will say, however, that if you need this book, look for a used copy of the first printing instead of one of these reprints. Pendragon scanned the original for this printing, and the plates of all the manuscripts you will probably need for your homework are much more clear in the original printing. Check the used market first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Resolution and Clarity","review":"I'm a software architect and I purchased this monitor for one thing, higher resolution, so that I could see more code on the screen at the same time. I have the resolution set to 1600x1200 and the clarity is outstanding--better than my Sony Multiscan Trinitron. Overall, this is simply the best CRT I've ever had.Only one caveat. It takes some time to set up this monitor. You will have to work through h and v size/position, pincushion, purity, contrast/brightness, convergence, rotation, etc. Be patient, it's worth the effort.Also, if you're cranking up the resolution, use at least a decent video card. I'm using a Radeon 7200 64MB DDR card and it works just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect digital pictures - text blurred!!!","review":"The monitor has great potential for displaying high quality pictures from digital camera. It was a great experience compared with my 6 y.o. Panasonic :) Superb colors, details, contrast - everything. But nothing is perfect - the text is sharp only at the left side of the display - the rest of it is blurred and makes it hard to look at. When I switch to 1280x1024 @85Hz (Recommended) the text is too blurred to work with. The clock at the bottom right has a reddish blurre! I'm going to call service center and ask them if they will repair/replace the unit. If not I will lower my rating to \\"one star\\" :( If the image on the new unit will be equally sharp I will raise it to 4 or even 5 stars and add some details about tested resolutions etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality problem","review":"I went through two monitors before Amazon stopped sending them due to widespread quality problems. The first was a complete blur. The second was bright and clear on the right side with a greenish tint on the left. The middle of the bottom bent upward and the upper left was a blur. I tried using the Viewsonic web site to resolve the issues. There is very little technical information on their site. I got an email after two days from Viewsonic tech support stating that the monitor was broken.I originally selected the monitor based on the technical specs which showed it to be one of the sharpest 19\\" monitors on the market.The monitor looks great when it is turned off. Fortunately, the free shipping and return policy kept me from losing money on the deal. So, 5 stars to Amazon, 1 star to Viewsonic."},{"rating":"1","title":"(...)","review":"This film, together with \\"Alexandra's Project\\", has got to be the lamest excuse for promoting porn, under the banner of so-called art, that I have ever seen. This film has absolutely no substance, and the sex scenes are as erotic as a dog humping a pillow.This film has brought shame rather than praise to the Australian Film Industry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid","review":"This is a terrible book that could be a good book. The IDEA for the book was solid, and some of the historical tidbits are interesting.It COULD have been an entertaining quest, but there is one enormous problem: the author is a pretentious, self-centered, pseudo-intellecutal child with a very high opinion of himself and the most irritating writing style known to man. Don't waste your time with this book unless you enjoy being patronized.Shame."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],W={key:0},M={key:1};function B(o,e,n,u,s,r){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",x,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(r.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:s.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[s.isLoading?(a(),i("span",M,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",W,"See more"))],8,H)):b("",!0)])}const N=d(O,[["render",B],["__scopeId","data-v-22f9404e"]]),P=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/66.md","filePath":"glossary/66.md"}'),j={name:"glossary/66.md"},L=Object.assign(j,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(N)]))}});export{P as __pageData,L as default};
