Gibson seems to be pissed off he accepted the role, the \\"Boston\\" accent is annoying, the movie is clearly a half hour too long and, typical of movies like this, the characters fearing for their lives all do predictably stupid things. Two and a half stars for the kernel of an idea for a good movie and a few good action sequences. Unfortunately this one is pretty much a paint by the numbers affair with a lot of long boring sceens of faux acting used as filler for a weak story. Save your money and rent if you must."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Conspiracy Plot","review":"I like Mel Gibson a lot and I would have given the movie 4 stars for acting and action, but I feel like America got blindsided by the plot. The story presumes to suggest that US government agents and contractors assassinate Americans on US streets. I would not have taken the slap seriously before talking to a couple of British educators that actually believe that the CIA assassinated JFK after they saw the Oliver Stone movie. Even though most of us know the difference between fact and fiction, movies leave a lasting impression."},{"rating":"1","title":"Propoganda Alert!!","review":"I am so fed up with the thinness, with the cliched and absurdity of the Hollywood vision of corporations; they are Dr. Evil, Bin Laden and Darth Vader all wrapped up into one. Where is the profit motive in killing innocent people? For once, can we have a movie where the bad guy isn't the CIA, the military, or a corporation and its villainous CEO? Can they put their sacred agenda away for just a minute a come up with something original? This movie fell into the formula so easily, and so quickly; a properly brain-washed 8 year old could have come up with it. And of course, the evil Senator leading the cover up was a Republican taking money from this killer corporation. When the hell was the last time there was a Replublican Senator in Mass? Even without the agenda the movie is terrible. Gibson looks and sounds terrible, the worst Boston accent I ever heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many holes in the story","review":"The story doesn't add up. The backstory is lacking for one.

They ended up sending me a whole different chair. The seats are hollow and easily cracks on the inside. This is with simple sitting. First the lever will randomly give out. This is on three different chairs. Same thing. It was embarassing when people would visit and I would have to warm them about the seats. My heart dropped every time someone hopped on them.

It's short, and easy to read. It also has numerous candid photos of Ip Man, historic places, his followers and family.

Of all the things that make this movie better, it's plot is even better...in that same believability vein. This one doesn't stink \\"silly\\" like the other ;p.It has a nice touch of everything. In a cold world of machines and gangs there are still those that will give of themselves for others. To me there was also this element of trust, from both main characters.

Big blockbusters usually don't entice me.

In fact Hollywood itself has a long history of \\"borrowing\\" - without Japanese Anime, \\"The Matrix\\" would never have existed. So why don't we lay aside the self-serving pretence that \\"The Matrix\\" is either an original conception or a yardstick for SciFi films, when in truth it's neither one, or that Hollywood is the ultimate font of cinematic art, which it most certainly is not, and evaluate these films on their own merits.

The movie's treatment of time travel (especially the little flashback at the end that explained some subtleties) was more rewarding than its treatment of the aliens. Questions about who the aliens were or why they came in the first place were not even addressed. There was considerable violence, including against kids, so this is not a family movie.

There is ZERO character development, and you only ever know what a character is feeling because they tell you...there is no \\"showing.\\" Jamie will say things like \\"Oh dear, I'm falling in love with Max\\" and so that's how the reader knows...not because there's been any chemistry or interaction between them.

Even if you adore Heinlein, it is worth reading Blish's critiques for a deeper view.Blish also analyses another author who was also a noted critic, Algis Budrys.

Between Tennant and Stewart, this version is my favorite yet (which is certainly saying something, because I normally hate modernizations of Shakespearean plays)!The only reason I gave the movie 4 stars rather than 5 is because it was over three hours long, and was a tad slow at points (this was only because they stayed with the script verbatim, which isn't necessarily a bad thing), and because at the very end, the dying was slightly unbelievable.

If Shakespeare were alive today, I can see him calling this version \\"a play by Alan Smithee.\\" Only Patrick Stewart was on the mark as Claudis, but alas he appeared to be acting in another company of players."},{"rating":"2","title":"David Tennant AND Patrick Stewart!","review":"These 2 actors, both of whom are more commonly known for their sci-fi acting, are amazing in Hamlet. The selectively modern interpretation is interesting and creative. Best version of Hamlet ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice!","review":"This version of Hamlet is simply lovely. As a Hamlet, Tennant, and Sir Patrick Stewart fan, I was delighted with the movie. It is performed as a stage production and set in modern time. As an educator, I thought this would have been a great version to show the students after reading Hamlet, but after watching it, I still think Branagh's version is a bit better in the sense that it's visually stimulating and that will help my students from falling asleep, but nonetheless, this version was still appreciated."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it.","review":"I'm a big fan of Shakespeare on film. It's how I was introduced to the Bard, and the more it embraces the strengths of film, the better. And Tennant does such a great, crazy Hamlet.

From the short history of the Turkish Republic to the second half of the book's coverage of all things in Turkey. The history of Turkey after Ataturks death has been rife with corrupt politicians, military takeovers and internal fights with the Kurds and Marxists. Turkey is gaining importance in the world order and this book helps explain the why and the how it is poised to do so. I picked up a great dea new info on Turkey, so this book was well worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blaming the victims","review":"Andrew Mango is a well-known denier of the Armenian Genocide and this book is unfortunately predictable both in the facts it highlights or suppresses and in its conclusions. He glorifies the Ottoman past of the country and (at best) denies without any evidence documented instances of suppression of non-Turkish ethnicities. The most disturbing feature of the author's approach is the indifference to human suffering he exhibits throughout the book. For example, deniers of the Armenian genocide typically make sure to stress what a terrible tragedy the death of so many thousands of people was, even though they deny the characterization 'genocide'. Not A. Mango. He barely mentions the events of 1915, but he spends pages and pages condemning \\"Armenian Terrorists\\", Armenian conspiracies etc. Any qualities of the book are unfortunately dwarfed by such exhibits of callousness and blaming of the victims."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Impact in a Quick Read!","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

The band has Harem Scarem style rock retaining some 80s rock legacy.Rainmaker is a great opening which lures you into melodic rock kingdom reminding me a bit of Harem Scarem masterpiece Mood Swings. I Am and Everywhere are excellent tracks. Lost Angeles is an unreleased Steve Perry tune but it is harder edged ballad. What I'd Rather Be is an uptempo pop rock track suited for a single cut. Great album for music fans to get hold of what an ideal melodic rock is.

I just wanted to use it as a data key and not worry about having to use the U3 LaunchPad to \\"eject\\" the drive, etc.Worse (for me) is that this version of the Cruzer is not supported for Win98. Two of the computers I use are still Win98. It took alot of googling and even a bit of registry editing to get this drive to work on all my computers. I reformated the drive using the \\"U3 Launchpad Removal Tool\\" available from SanDisk, and found a generic USB storage device driver called nusb24e.exe (use at your own risk) that allowed me to use the drive on the Win98 computers.If I had known about these issues I would have gotten an older version of Cruzer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am very disappointed in the 512MB Cruzer Micro 2 I purchased recently. The Launch Pad system sucks. There is no way to disable it. Every computer I tried automatically installs the stupid Launch Pad that takes too long to install. It will crash some computers running windows 2000 and XP. It loads from a protected drive that is read only with no way to delete it. I lose 33 MB out of the 512 MB to this program. I paid for 512 MB not 479 MB. I only hope I can return it. I will not consider buying SanDisk products again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saboteur","review":"Scripted by the inimitable Dorothy Parker, Hitchcock's nerve-rattling wartime thriller takes a favorite theme--the wrongly accused man-- and gives it a strong, seditious twist. Terrific acting and a breakneck pace make this one of Hitch's most suspenseful movies, right up there with \\"North by Northwest\\" or \\"The 39 Steps.\\" The cast is great, and the locations are used to brilliant effect. Kane's climactic scramble up the Statue of Liberty, a scene as tense and dramatic on repeated viewings as it is the first time around, is \\"Saboteur\\" 's unforgettable piece de resistance."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Trivia\\" paragraph poppycock!","review":"The \\"Trivia\\" on \\"Saboteur sez that the Mafia set fire to the liner \\"Normandie\\". Hogwash! The fire was caused by careless welding during the chaos of transforming the vessel into a troopship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wartime propaganda - not a real movie","review":"Saboteur is more propaganda than film. The plot seems like an excuse to make someone's political point. The only redeeming aspect of this movie is studying the propaganda and putting it in a historical context.After seeing this movie, it's obvious to me that the 5 star rave reviews are, most likely, from people who have a stake in selling this DVD. Shame, shame!Saboteur could be an excellent basis for a drinking game. Every time someone makes a speech or says something about freedom or America, take a drink.

There were none. Grace Lazenby's All the Right Moves had all this and then some, and she just used a pole for balance! This was not Ballet inspired even though she does use the word \\"plie\\". I bought the DVD after reading the bad reviews thinking how bad could it be? It was THAT bad, I wish I never bought it. I gave two stars because I have enough experience that I didn't have to follow along with a visual as much, as long as you pay extra attention to her verbal cues which are hard to understand, so I ended up getting a good thigh workout. Hmmm. maybe resell....?"},{"rating":"1","title":"amateur production but a great instructor","review":"It is a shame that the talented instructor made such a poorly put together DVD. It runs straight through probably shot with a fixed camera. The music is not only bad it is annoying and it would help if it were not there at all. The DVD does not even allow you to advance or go back to review which is important in an instructional film. The title is also misleading as much of this is not done with a barre. Cannot possibly recommend this DVD but I would recommmend the instructor if she is on more professional DVDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Barre is pure bliss!","review":"Pure bare is an incarnation of the lotte berk method, bar method, burr leonard method, fluidity, and cardio barre. I like it because it actually is a long enough session to work all your muscles- if trying to lose weight, I suggest also doing some cardio- although I have seen incredible results only using this video + 20mins of elliptical for only 3 times a week. I am definitely a believer- but this dvd is not for workout wimps. In addition, there is some feedback with the microphone and the background music (it sounds like someone is tapping on the microphone), but it's only for a couple seconds, and completely negligible. I will probably use this dvd to tone my body for the rest of my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst exercise DVD ever - don't buy it","review":"Save your money, or you'll end up watching a DVD shot by a 5-year-old in someone's dimly-lit basement.The exercises are not well explained, and you can't watch them either because the instructor is wearing black pants and what look like black tights against a dark grey, dimly-lit floor - so any nuance is absolutely lost. I just couldn't figure out what she was doing, and again, her instructions are worse than poor.The ab work is very similar to 1980s ab work, hard on the neck, and not necessarily proven to streamline the core. I have avoided this type of \\"crunch\\" ab work for years because so many instructors provide better and more proven alternatives.I wouldn't call this DVD a workout; just a random selection of exercises done in semi-darkness.There are better ballet-inspired workouts on Amazon; buy them and skip this."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're gonna buy this DVD, read the reviews first!","review":"I, on the other hand, failed to do so and was disappointed...It's not because it was too hard or too easy I just could not see what the hell she was doing! I mean really, black clothes and black shoes on a black floor in a dark room? Why did she bother? She should have saved her money and just made a cd explaining what each move was, because I spent most of my time struggling to figure out what she was doing. It doesn't help that I couldn't skip ahead or replay what she said/did, the dvd won't let you.If you have done Pure Barre before, I imagine you wont have a hard time keeping up. If you're a beginner, look else where.Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, the humanity...","review":"The music was god awful and the lights were tacky. Simple overhead lighting would have accommodated or at least, enabled the viewer to actually see her feet. I want to know in what universe does anyone who is instructing movement wear black pants with black tights on a black floor? It makes it impossible to discern proper placement.These points aside, the exercises are a mix of pilates, beginner barre, and Gilad's workout. None of the movement was anything new. In fact, I could have easily put these combinations together at home for free.If you are after a good beginning ballet workout, David Howard is fantastic. If you are more advanced, New York City Ballet workout is quickly paced and has various sections so you are in control of what you want to work out.However, if you just want a great workout, run in the other direction of this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"agree with the production","review":"I would have to agree with the production.

Worked areas that I never noticed I had been neglecting. It is a very challenging workout but totally doable. I find myself doing extra moves through out my day to add a little extra.The one thing I had a hard time with is the darkness of the video along with Carries dark clothing made it hard to see the positioning of her legs which kind of make me wonder if I was in the correct position. But I aske my mom who was in ballet for years and understood.I am purchasing the second one today since my legs are looking great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Imitation","review":"This is the most cheaply made video. It may as well be a home video that was made in someone's basement. The sound quality is also terrible.

Don't waste your money on this cheapy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible instruction","review":"This dvd provided a good burn once I figured out what on earth the instructor was doing. It is filmed very poorly, shot from the wrong angles so that you often have no idea what the instructor is doing. Secondarily, her instructions seem to have little to do with her actions. I was yelling angrily at the screen during the first 30 minutes but noticed when I finished the workout that I felt toned and trembly. A good workout but a terrible production."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far from Ballet Barre workout","review":"The title \\"Pure Barre\\" fooled me into buying this DVD, but I was so disappointed that the workout was far from ballet barre workout. In addition, there are no new or \\"fresh\\" workout routines in this DVD. The instructor has huge quads and her hip placement is obviously not that of a good dancer. (I'm afraid I will be like her if I use this DVD.) She also wears a pair of flared pants and it is difficult to follow her turn out or her leg positions. The production is also terrible.

The exercises themselves may be wonderful, but not to be able to see how to do the exercises.....forget it!I bought this DVD due to the title. In between my ballet classes, I work out at home. If you are looking for a DVD for exercise or for additional help with your dancing, do NOT buy Pure Barre.~Dream Catcher"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Barre is a rip off.","review":"For the price of the DVD I expected more than one 20 minute work out. Also, the instructor is wearing a black loose fitting outfit and the video is such that you can't see what you are supposed to do and she doesn't describe it well enough. The DVD is a waste of money! It is possible that the Barre technique is good for shaping and toning, but you won't get it from this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"barre","review":"No different than any other strength training except you hold a bar often throughout the workout so you do not fall over. The bar is nothing else but a balancing tool. Not sure why that is so unique. If you have never worked out before, you could easily strain your knees and back and shorten all your muscles. Any repetitive movement not done correctly can cause pain. My hamstrings and knees hurt more now than ever after many trys at this routine. My pilates teacher and massage therapist have told me to stop immediately so i do not hurt myself further. The only reason i give this one star is that its better than doing nothing at all. Please do pilates with a qualified teacher before even trying this video or a live class. This is absolutely no supplement for dance or pilates or yoga.

A low class working African-American man of little education but with a lot of common wisdom, he attends the same bar and has discussions with the bartender (ie. the narrator) regarding social and, most important, racial issues during that period in America (the '50s). Somewhat dated now (or that's what we hope), the stories are still enjoyable. What makes it so enjoyable is the great dialogue, which is of such clever wit. From the first line that Simple utters, it defines him: \\"If you want to know about my life, don't look at my face, don't look at my hands. Look at my feet and see if you can tell how long I been standing on them.\\" No wonder Langston Hughes later turned to writing for the theatre. It's a pity he's not around anymore.

After the first month, I became frustrated with the poor explanations. I asked a few friends and they recommended Biology by Campbell. What a lifesaver!I also continued to used this book and also found a number of errors in the pictures. This cost me a few points on tests and quizzes, so this added to my low opinion of this book. I also became hesitant to trust what it was telling me, particularly when there were differences between Campbell and this book.It has a nice layout, and it breaks topics into meaningful chunks; the explanations were okay most times and simply inadequate too frequently for me. On a scale of 1 to 10, this book is about a 3 or 4 and Campbell is a 9.

I already owned a few of these songs, and 2. they weren't really favorites of mine. Sadly they turned out to be some of the best material here (like \\"Run Out Pon Dem,\\" which is not a great tune but is at least driving and catchy). The whole thing feels kind of slapdash and inconsistent, jumping between styles, sounds, and years like a coked-up frog.

It's bad enough they had to make one sequel but 3 was just a mistake, Jaws: The Revenge is huge proof of that. It's silly enough that another huge shark just happens to come back to the same beach and no one believes Roy Scheider all over again. However Roy Scheider is the reason this film is good, he manages to hold the film without Robert Shaw \\"for a good reason...his character was eaten in the original\\" and Richard Dryfus.Although Scheider is solid, the teenagers who get attacked by Jaws at the end are awful, you got really bad Friday the 13th caliber acting there.

It has no inspiraton to do anything out of the ordinary or new. It simply settles back into mold that JAWS created. But you wanna know what? It does so pretty darn well. The teenagers are definatly bearable, and the movie doesn't take their little \\"dating-game\\" lifestyles too seriously. And there are some pretty shocking shark attack scenes that terrify without being tasteless. The best one is Marge's death; a socking and disturbing attack accompanied by a tragic and Horrifying piece of John William's score.

The three followups pale in comparison and offered nothing new. Without Steven Spielberg, Richard Dreyfuss or Robert Shaw, this second JAWS is lacklusterly directed by Jeannot Szwarc, a Frenchman who should stick with low key films like his SOMEWHERE IN TIME or his stints on the NIGHT GALLERY tv series. His pace is so languid, there is little suspense generated. It doesn't help that too much time is focused on a bunch of teenagers who are merely whiny and plot devices. Roy Scheider tries gamely to recreate the passion of his original role, but even he seems tired and bored with the whole thing. Even John Williams score is uninspired and redundant. If you like shark attack movies, you may be able to tolerate this...just don't think it's as good as JAWS."},{"rating":"1","title":"A DULL SEQUEL TO A GREAT MOVIE JAWS","review":"I saw JAWS 2 after I saw JAWS and there is just no comparison JAWS would chomp this wannabe out of the water and here's why.

I got the feeling while watching this movie ROY SCHINDER didn't want to be in this movie either and it showas up in his acting performance. Also you see the GREAT WHITE SHARK too often in this film and it takes away a lot of the suspense the first one had so it is best to leave this one on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"this movie stinks''","review":"this is a bad movie i saw Jaws,Jaws2,and Jaws3-d and Jaws 2 is the worst check out jaws 3-d now that one is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"where were the toothpicks?","review":"still a seat of the pants movie after all this time --- well done.

While it was good to see Roy Sheider as Sheriff Brody again, he seems to be phoning it in half the time. Out of the 4 Jaws movie this one is my least favorite because it seems almost like the first movie never took place. The town's leaders have the same reaction as in part one: denial, etc. Till the shark almost has to swim up, say hello, and bite someone publicly before these guys will do anything. But you also have to take it as what its meant to be, a sequel to a shark movie. I would recommend this one only for completionists as Jaws 3 and 4 are way better, but of course nothing comes close to the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only worthy sequal","review":"Jaws 2, is the only sequal, that can compete with the original.

I thought the teen actors where really good, and they did a terrific job off showing genuine fear and terror (even though some people would disagree with me, I know). So go check it out.

So the pressure in making this uneveidable sequel must have been either \\"oh god this isn't going to work!\\" or \\"This is JAWS, we can't loose!\\" At the box office: Fair. With the critics: Don't ask. Mostly just because it's a sequel to a great american film. Most of the original cast is here, Roy Schieder is Martin Brody, Lorraine Gary is his wife Ellen, and Murray Hamilton is Larry (hey there's no shark!) Vaughan. The shark effects (This time by Roy Arbogast) need improvement, but are exceptible. As for plot, it's pretty much a carbon copy of the original, with one exception: the teenagers stalked by the shark is reminicent of HALLOWEEN (Though they were released the same year so you can give it's writers half the credit).

Although it may not live up to the original (some people say so) it is still excellent to watch over and over again. I liked Chief Martin Brody (once again played by Roy Scheider) in this film because his acting is untouchable. Although this film lacks the greatness of director Steven Spielberg, director Jeannot Swarc did a great job as well. For those who are fans of the franchise, I recommend this to you. Those who hate sequels... I'll pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do they keep doing this to us?","review":"In a nutshell, this is a pretty decent movie. It is definitely a cut above many sequels. What kills this DVD presentation though it the \\"Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono\\" sound. Come on now...Jaws was released last year in a DTS presentation, and this movie is more recent than the first. Why are we being forced to tolerate MONO here? Do the movie companies think we don't know or don't care? I sure know that this movie sounded like crap compared to the DTS presentation of the first one. I am going to sell my copy of this DVD and wait for it to be released correctly so that I can enjoy it.

The device operates off of two AA batteries that are secured on the backside beneath a screwed cover that takes an eyeglass screwdriver to access. I think having the screw cover is a great idea with kids but wish the screw was a larger size so time isn't lost picking up the smaller tool.

I'm looking forward to the talked about sequel. If you are looking for a book that takes you UP, then down and out filled with frustration and anger, then back up for a rally...this IS the book!

If you're looking for the real story behind the punk movement, this is most definately the book for you. Please Kill Me provides a great insight into this mixed up generation. The fact that the entire book is being told by the people who were part of the movement, and experienced the events first hand, is great proof of the accuracy of this book. Rather than reading one person's take on different events that they've done extensive research on, this book is a true representation of the movement, as it walks you through the punk evolution with first hand accounts. I'm yet to find another book that comes close to this one. Overall, this is just a greatly informative book, that's incredibly fast paced and entertaining. Any music fan will not regret their purchase of Please Kill Me.I reccomend to all, you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Punk Lives!","review":"This book comes together as a seamless oral history by the biggest players in the American punk movement-- all the great bands, artists, and poets, who were there from the beginning.

It made me blast the Stooges; introduced me to Johnny Thunders & Richard Hell; Made me love Television and The Ramones even more, and gave me great sympathy for some poor old fool named Danny Fields who was trampled underfoot by his love for rock n' roll.

Legs set the intreviews, from diferent people that faced that time, in stead of summarising the ideas.(Legs lived tha scene too, so he knows what he is talking about).

I was very impressed not only with the writing style and format of the book, but also with the sheer volume of information that it included. I was expecting a basic \\"this band started this date and the original members were so and so and his brother.\\" kind of thing, and was quite pleased at the details that were included in the book. My favorite part would have to be Sid Vicious singing country songs and crying to himself around Christmas time, you won't find that kind of thing anywhere else.

Come on, even though none of use punk lovers were even born before the first Punk was made, we all know that Brit punk is the best. haha....j/k :) Well actually, the reason i didn'tgive this book a 5 star rating was because of the rockstar ways of the early participants of the NY Punk scene. But that, I admit, can not be blamed on the writer, his only fault is writing on the all together boring early American Punk days.

It was relatively inexpensive, but you get what you pay for. The cartridges for it cost around thirty dollars and then magically dry up in a couple of months, with the printer task bar being completely inaccurate in telling you when they will dry up. The printer itself has a tendency to jam at inopportune times. For some reason unbeknownst to the mortal world, this printer always tries to pull all the pieces of paper in the paper dispensing container and then get jammed. So be prepared to abort print jobs and grab twenty pieces of paper from the printer's maw.

Her first album starts off with a bang, on \\"Nao Existe O Amor\\", a cover of a French pop song, but quickly slips away from the real rock feel they were aiming for, and into iffy mainstream pop. A recent CD reissue adds a booming big band version of \\"Tell Me How Long\\", which was presumably originally on a single. By the time of her second album, \\"Quero Voce,\\" Wanderlea's rock sound had solidified and toughened up, and the girl group debt was made plainer with the inclusion of covers such as \\"Meu Bem Lollipop\\".

I'm glad we did. This flick had a fun balance of comedy and action and goes in my favorite chase movies of all time. I thought the plot was great with a nice twist at the end and the acting was all deadpan cool. All the actors have a twinkle in their eyes like they're having fun in this \\"stupid\\" genre. I certainly never expected to like Ice Cube but after a while his perma-scowl had a sort of perverse energy to it, and his one liners rang with charm.

I did not get to see it in January when it came out because my friends thought the preview made it look dumb. I saw it today and even if they said it looked dumb (which it is a little), it still is a lot of fun. The story is very easy to follow and the movie's chase scenes are pretty decent. The very last chase was a bit unrealistic, but if you are seeing the movie for fun (which it is, a fun movie) then you will forgive it. A lot of the dialogue and story is cheesy, but sometimes cheesy can be a lot of fun. I have a liking to this fairly new actor Martin Henderson and Monet (don't know her last name) is a hottie.

Torque is a ripoff of such films as The Fast and the Furiouse and Biker Boyz.The story is that a guy named Ford has returned from Thailand to settle an old score with some people, a group of Bikers called the Hellions. the Hellions manipulate a group called the Reapers to go after Ford. SO for 85% of the movie we witness one motorcycle chase after another until the end when they ride off into the sunset.This is painfully bad in that just as they start to go into some story we witness another chase scene or brawl. It boggles the mind as to why this even being released in Theaters when good movies such as In Hell or the ever Classic Tremors Series is trapped in the Bowels of Direct to Video.

This is a complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A joke of a movie.","review":"From the opening scene, where Ford says he's running a 'two for one special' i knew this was going to be a bad B grade movie... and it was.The action in this movie was very mildly entertaining and thats not saying much considering its a pure action flick.The story was a mess, especially those two FBI agents. I guess the US government hires FBI agents off of MTV now...And the dialogue in this movie was atrocious. Many of the lines have you laughing at them, not with them.Also, that girl vs girl scene or should i say Pepsi vs Mountain Dew was the biggest blatant advertising ever in a movie. Its truly laughable.Since i have to give the movie at least one star i will give that star to Jaime Pressley because she looks real good in this movie. Thats all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius Filmmaking","review":"Ice Cube, while riding on an insanely loud motorcycle, through the windy plains, while wearing a really thick helmet, is able to have a conversation with someone on a cell phone, by putting it up to where his ear would be.

Every line is delivered in that hard guy, rough low tone. Biggest shock, Ice Cube plays, you'll never guess...the tough black guy. I know, mindblowing. It's pretty stupid when some guy is in the middle of the desert and someone sneaks up on him, on a bike. I'm no bike expert, but I'm pretty sure you'd hear those coming. Whoever played the two cops (i felt it unimportant to look up their names) were horrible, it was like two MTV Vjs.

I love motorcycles so even though I wasn't expecting much of a story I thought it could be fun.

Part of it is lame, completely unrealistic story. While I like cool stunts and bikes, this was just too unbelivable. And let's not forget the \\"FBI agent\\" and his sidekick. Is that a joke or what? What really ruined it for me was Ice cube(where did he come up with that nickname-he likes ice cubes?). I don't understand why would anyone put him a movie since he can't act if his life depended on it. He scowls a lot and that's about it. Overall, not even remotely entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the most boring movie with wheels ever made","review":"Not even as entertaining as Biker Boyz, which was a pretty lame movie in itself. It shows the speedometer's of various riders going very high, but you rarely see any shots where they're actually driving fast. Okey plot, but very stupid dialogue and exaggerated villains and stereotypes.Rent or buy \\"Drive\\" with Marc Damascas for a good \\"high-octane\\" movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just okay","review":"There were parts of this movie I found entertaining, but it's not something I would watch over and over again. Myself a biker, I can appreciate the \\"rush\\" they tried to give over and over again with the bike chases and stunts, but most of the stunts were so physically impossible that it ruined whatever credibility they could have had. (Yes, it is impossible to do a stoppie and simultaneously swing the bike around so the rear wheel, which is in the air, whacks someone next to you in the head then continue to ride at 160mph).I agree this falls into the category of \\"Biker Boyz,\\" if you liked that movie, you will probably like this one. But it isn't an improvement, and it's really missing originality when it comes to the plot. The acting isn't that bad, but when you don't have great dialogue to work with, there's only so much you can do to make it not look cheesy.And yes, this movie does include the so-infamous-it's-almost-clich�� line \\"I live my life one quarter-mile at a time.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Never received merchandise","review":"The trucking company indicated that the merchandise was left on my front door but I never received it.

XP Installed is a great book and explains everything covered in this one and more. This book had about 10 pages of additional information that XP Installed didnt. ... for those 10 pages is pretty expensive.Third, Considering the books short length, its further anoying that almost a third of it was just a rehash of what XP is. The real content of the book was maybe 90 pages, and even that has lots of blank pages, end of chapter white space, etc.Save your money, and dont buy this book. Instead read XP Installed.

It was well worth all the struggle to get to it. I am a huge fan of Trey Parker and Matt Stone. I thought \\"BASEketball\\" and \\"Cannibal! The Musical\\" was hilarious. But when I walked out of the theater from \\"Orgazmo\\", my stomach muscles literally hurt from all the laughing I did. This is one of the funniest movies you'll ever see. It is about Joe Young (Parker), a Mormon Missionary who gets pulled into the porno industry to try to earn money for his upcoming nuptuals. He is the porno superhero, Orgazmo, and he becomes a big hit. I don't want to tell you too much, but don't miss seeing this movie. I am buying it at full price.

Trey Parker plays a mormon who's in California just trying to pay for his wedding. But when he meets porno-director Maxxx Orbison, who won't take no for an answer, he becomes the title charecter. Now, I'm not always the best judge of charecter, but the director Mr. Orbison has too much authority that I found rather unbelievable. Basically, because he makes so much money, he thinks no one can refuse him, let's just say he finds out otherwise the hard way.If you're a fan of South Park, the poor taste humor will be more than enough to amuse, however this film could've just as easily been rated R as opposed to X, oh well. There's barely any nudity for one thing, plus the so-called sexual content is mostly simulated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Orgazmo Rocks","review":"This has got to be one of the funniest movies that I have ever seen. I can't believe they gave it a NC-17 rating because I have seen a lot worse out there. If you have a sense of humor this movie is for you. Let me put it another way... if you don't like South Park, or, you saw the movie Baseketball and did not like it then there is something wrong with you and this movie is not for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected","review":"I picked up this DVD just because I am a fan of Trey Parker and Matt Stone.

It's such a hilarious parody of the more naive LDS members (mostly in a good natured way) and the porn industry that I just couldn't help it. And besides, the A.F. twins are really cute."},{"rating":"2","title":"Low-Budget Fabulocity","review":"LEts get this straight right off the bat. This is not the type of low budget film that will have critics in \\"The New Yorker\\" gasping about the brilliance of the director, and how did they show so much angst and dark dissasociation in their alienated cast..blah blah blah. This is just a camp, laugh out loud at i'ts cheeseball nature great time. A young mormon Missionary in L.A. winds up in a porn movie to save enough money to mary the girl of his dreams, as well as fellow choir member. He thinks nobody will know, and doesn't get naked. \\"They bring out a stunt dick which, when you see the different actors is one of the best jokes\\" Unfortunatly for him the movie outgrosses E.T.

I will admit that if you don't have the right sense of humor, you may think the movie is stupid, boring, or offensive. It's quickly becoming a cult classic in my dance troupe, we watch it whenever we are sewing at the troupe director's house. Our new motto is, \\"I...am Sancho!\\" We also love the theme song (\\"Now you're a maaayon!\\") The characters are also very well thought out, from Joe to Ben to G-Fresh.

And it has the same (ahem) level of sophisticated comedy you might come to expect after watching several episodes of South Park. And it's almost as funny. If you like South Park, Im sure you'll love the story of a Mormon missionary who fights crime with his 'orgasmo' ray while working in the porn industry to save up money for his wedding in Utah. However, if you don't think that's funny, then stay away. That goes double if you actually are a Mormon. While I wouldn't call the film hate-mongering, it's a little mean spirited at times.

One because I laughed a couple of times, and another because that sneaky Trey Parker actually managed to squeeze in a serious message or two about religion and pornography in the middle of all the crude humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hampster Style!","review":"Orgazmo rages from start to finish.

The video motion however is another story. The speed is such that all movements are jerky and far from real life. This is especially a major irritant when conferencing between our office locations. I thought I could put in an accelerator card to solve the problem but was told that the camera just isn't good enough. I have 11mb or Ram for video at present. I guess I'll be buying another product.

Too bad the store did not have a DVD player but the employee told me that he already had two individuals returned the same title for the same reason I had.

The Pope dealt with a wide range of topics, but focused special attention on economic justice. While there is much that a democratic capitalist (to broow Michael Novak's useful phrase) might quibble with in the encyclical, it nevertheless rewards careful reading. Unfortunately, this book does not do it justice. The book is in two parts. First, a poorly edited condensation of the encyclical itself. Second, a collection of essays. The commentaries mostly appeared in a 1991 issue of National Review. They average 3-4 printed pages. The analysis is uniformly shallow and even trite. In short, there is little here that would be of interest to the serious scholar or even the informed layman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy with product","review":"The charger didn't work, the camera bag was cheap and the tripod didn't fit my Sony DSC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quilting","review":"I love this book.

Through an engaging style of writing, Muravchik describes in detail the lives of these leaders who helped make socialism such a powerful force in the world. Even those familiar with the figures in this book will likely discover details in Heaven on Earth that are new to them. The book also draws out commonalities shared by many of those described, such as their middle class backgrounds and tendencies to turn their beliefs into a pseudo-religion. In sum, Heaven on Earth is an engrossing read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-written and illuminating","review":"I can't think of a better introduction to the leading figures in the savage history of socialism. Muravchik is a fluid writer who adds some juice to potentially dry material. He covers the basic historical timeline, dispels the myth that right- and left-wing collectivism are incompatible, and tosses in some spicy gossip. Sadly, the desire for dependency and power are deeply implanted in human nature, so this story is not going to end soon. Socialism will always take new forms and breed new tragedies for future writers. The footnotes are badly done in the edition I have. They are not enumerated in the text."},{"rating":"2","title":"You know it hits home when the NY Times Ignores you","review":"Although the book is just a touch too scholarly, it provides a fascinating historical overview of socialism.The book lays out a pattern's of behavior common to socialist thinkers; anti-semitism, hatred for religion, compulsion to separate the family unit, and an incessant belief that they the elite vanguard should be the ruling class, controlling the masses.It is a highly informative one-stop source for highlighting the horror of socialism. A rare and valuable piece of work that objectively gets to the truth and counters the revisionist garbage regurgitated by the left."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately unconvincing","review":"The book is quite interesting from a historical point of view. However, its major failure is exemplified by Mr. Sowell review below. The tragic mistake of confusing totalitarianism with socialism is repeated here. Mr. Sowell's soundbite \\"redistribution of wealth leads to redistribution of poverty\\" is just plain wrong. Some counter examples might include Social Security, Medicare, and Urban Housing assistance--all products of socialism that have immensely benefited our society. Sweden, one of the most socialized countries in the world, is also judged by The Economist as one of the most economically competitive--the point is that Sweden is socialistic but democratic. That a learned scholar, Mr. Muravchik, would fail to clarify the difference in a substantial text is disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rating system confusing?","review":"The book is a epic tale of historical yearnings that are eternal,your rating system is on the other hand,a confused,needlessly complicated mess.

The shortest in the collection is three pages and the longest is forty-seven, but most are around ten pages. As the title suggests most of these stories are science fiction, but some are fantasy and some are about the magic of every-day life. In many stories there is an atmosphere of small-town-America, an America which seems to have been lost since the 1950's. Not surprisingly most of the tales have a copyright date somewhere in that decade, but this did not spoil the book for me at all. The text is much too well drafted to suffer from minor points like that. This book is ideal if you only occasionally have an hour, or half an hour, to spare in a busy life.

Somewhere along the way the songs were cut, perhaps mercifully, leaving one of the deadest, dreariest screenplays ever written. Director Joseph Hardy's claim to fame was the off-Broadway musical \\"You're a Good Man Charlie Brown,\\" making him not the ideal choice to direct a rich and subtle period piece, with or without the singing and dancing. 30-ish (40-ish?) Sarah Miles is miles too old to play Estella as a girl, but she does so anyway to no good purpose, and the rest of the cast is predictable in a way that makes everything tiresome. Who wants to see Michael York as yet another Victorian Englishman? Who wants to see Margaret Leighton struggle with the role of Miss Haversham?

I just cannot get over the fact that this is the same man who wrote Quadrophenia and The Who Sell Out.What few musical highlights there are on this CD and vastly overshadowed by lyrics that could have just as well come from the junior high school band I played in 25 years ago. I started that band because of The Who. This CD will never inspire anyone that way.The only good I can see coming from Endless Wire is that it clearly confirms the notion that rock music is best left to the young and insprired and that if you are old, rich you are boring.

I dont have every Who album so i'm not their biggest fan...but i do know and appreciate all types of music and this album simply just didnt rock it for me. Seems slow and similar to Willy Nelson's Phases and Stages...wise words, i'm sure very poetic...it's just not quite what i was expecting from Pete Townshend.

Imagine Townshend rehashing old musical ideas with only half of the brilliant band that made them work, and that is what you have here.\\"Fragments\\" is a slapdash of \\"Baba O'Riley,\\" and it doesn't even come close to measuring up to the greatness of the latter song. \\"Black Widow's Eyes\\" features the same rhythms that Pete used in \\"I Can see For Miles,\\" and \\"In The Ether\\" tries to sound like Tom Waits, but only Tom Waits can sound like Tom Waits.There's a few bright spots here; \\"We Got A Hit\\" isn't bad, and \\"It's Not Enough\\" comes closest to being classic Who.

The Kenney Jones records felt quite half-hearted...impacted by Townshend's addiction and subsequent recovery...but reactive to Keith Moon's death. No...Keith and John are gone (and missed terribly), but Pete has perhaps crafted the most honest and heart-felt and consistent record under the Who moniker since Quadrophenia.

A must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Who-still rock w/ grace","review":"This album is very subtle and has grown on me.the songs are deceptively simple with melody and hooks. The Who still can rock as witnessed by having seen them live this year.

I recommend this cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Who, Two - Long Live Rock","review":"Yeah, it's been a long time and much in the world has changed since It's Hard.What matters most is the new \\"Two\\" songs by Townshend and performances by \\"The Two\\" hold up quite nicely with current releases of new material by contemporaries Ray Davies, Neil Young, Peter Frampton and Bob Dylan. Endless Wire is certainly much better than any new material that Clapton or The Rolling Stones have released over the last 20 or so years. In fact Endless Wire is much better than the post Moon Face Dances and It's Hard.Townshend contuniues to grow as a composer and even though age has taken some toll on Rog's voice he sounds great singing Pete's songs.

Uninspired.","review":"There is no purpose to this recording. When Pete Townshend wrote \\"Music Must Change\\" he was at least aware of self-plagerism. Every song on Endless Wire sounds like retread of another song. \\"Fragments\\" starts off like \\"Baba O'Riley\\" (Who' Next), \\"Sound Round\\" is \\"I've Had Enough\\" (Quadrophenia), \\"Pick Up The Peace\\" is similar to \\"Sister Disco\\" (Who Are You), etc.Endless Wire makes It's Hard seem like a masterpiece. At least there was \\"Athena\\", \\"Eminence Front\\" and \\"Dangerous\\".

They were still so vital and fun when I saw them in 2000; how could they have decayed so much in the few years that passed before this CD/DVD? I guess John was a bigger part of what made The Who The Who than I had previously appreciated. This is exactly what it sounds like, a shockingly bad Pete Townshend solo album, with a few vocals by a very tired and raggedy sounding Roger Daltry. I hope Roger will concentrate now more on his acting career, as he has a lot to offer there, still. And Pete? What else can a broken down old musical genius do? Produce, of course, or maybe take another stab at writing novels (the paper kind)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"I loved this album by The Who, \\"Endless Wire\\". It is one of the most beautiful albums I have ever heard. It's like a mix of \\"Tommy\\" and \\"Quadrophenia\\"-flavored melody. Amazing work, Pete and Rog!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you, Pete and Roger","review":"While not The Who's best work, we should be only grateful to have this wonderful CD. Is it \\"the best Who CD since _______ ?\\" (place your favorite Who CD here) Probably not. Does it break new ground or add anything significant to The Who's body of work? Definitely. Is it flawed? Yes. Does Roger's voice sound frayed at times? Yup. Does that matter? Nope. Is it a moving CD in its own way? Very. Does it bring a sense of repose that is unique to The Who's body of work? Yes. Would it have benefited from Entwistle's participation? Absolutely. Do Pete and Roger embarrass themselves in any way with this? Absolutely not.Thank you, Pete and Roger, for giving us this music, which didn't need to exist, yet which is a moving and welcome addition to a tremendous body of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do you remember?","review":"Do you remember Tommy or Quadrophenia? Were you a young fan of The Who at that time? Well, stop remembering and listen to this CD! Although time has passed for everyone of us (as you can see on the bonus DVD), the sound and soul are the same.Don't miss, hurry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Return To Lifehouse.","review":"As impossible as it may seem, Endless Wire can stand with pride next to the greatest albums from this greatest of rock 'n' roll bands. It certainly makes amends for Face Dances & It's Hard, blowing those albums to pieces. In their stead we are given this flawless effort which addresses themes that have concerned Pete for decades; it continues to explore ideas first touched upon in the Lifehouse/Who's Next period.This album, against all odds, perfectly captures that WHO sound, filled with passion and rocking at full tilt. Pete is the genius composer of all time; these songs verify that yet again. And he sure as hell is no slouch on the guitar, either, as he blazes away like days of old. Roger's voice continues to soar with emotion, giving perfect expression to Pete's visions. Those who say they are let down and unimpressed by this instant classic are beyond my understanding. What was expected from the first Who album in 24 years? My answer: Endless Wire."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was dissapointed","review":"Where are the power chords, the heavy guitar sound ?The tunes did not generate any excitement for me like the Who's tunes of the seventies and early 80's. Roger's vocals are still alright to me, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I can understand people looking beyond the music and appreciating the staying power of talented musicians such as Pete and Roger. I am a long time Who fan and have appreciated everything I have heard from them including solo projects, rock operas, mixed anthologies, lost classics, etc.I can say with complete conviction, after anticipating a new Who studio album amid rumors for the last two decades, that I am no longer a Who fan. I simply did not like this.Just because we age along with our favorite artists, doesn't mean we have to settle for something that is totally devoid of any 'punch'. This album lacked anything to keep me awake. Maybe that is why I have heard nothing from this album on the radio!I may be middle aged, but I still need some music I can air guitar to. I can't picture Pete smashing his guitar on stage to anything from this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"As a Who fanatic, I was very disappointed with this effort. Pete's writing has mellowed way too much for my taste. I recently saw the Who perform live, and the low points of the concert were the songs from \\"Endless Wire\\" and Roger's voice as he was almost completely unable to sing. He claimed to be suffering from bronchitis, but he was able to play the harmonica flawlessly on Baba O'Riley."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like this","review":"Well , let me start of by saying that nothing can detract from what the Who have done. With the Beatles and Stones , they form the Holy Trinity of Rock.They will be forever heralded as one of the best ever. Now , on to this recording.....THIS IS THE SINGLE LARGEST PIECE OF TRASH ISSUED BY A MAJOR BAND EVER!!!!- I wanted to like this. I counted the days on a calender to the day it would be released for months. 2 songs will be played again : \\"Man In A Purple Dress\\" and \\"Tea And Sympathy\\" , the rest will never see my cd player again.Those two songs are fabulous.The rest of the disc ? Disjointed pieces of music with no unifying thought , other than \\"okay here's another 2 minutes\\". And the bonus disc ? Did ANYONE involved with the band actually listen to this? It is a shame to hear one of the greatest voices in rock history struggle with so many passages. Man , I hope this isn't the last Who studio album. It would be a travesty to have such a sweet band go out on such sour notes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to hear new Who music","review":"As a longtime Who fan, I thought I would be disappointed by this album, seeing as how two original member are now gone. But, I was happily surprised. I find the chorus of certain numbers like 'Two Thousand Years'and 'We Got a Hit' (almost sounds like The Who from the 60's) sometimes stick in my brain. 'Sound Round' really rocks. And the acoustic numbers are really good. I didn't think I would feel that way, as I like to hear them rock. It's been 24 years since we last heard new Who music. Hope we don't have to wait as long for another batch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Stop Listening to it","review":"I have been reading some reviews on Amazon about this terrific album and I am flummoxed. Are these people listening to the same record I am listening to? I think not! I bought it and listened and listened again and again, and I find the songs totally inspired. The songs offer a variety of tempos and sounds that keeps things interesting. The lyrical content is Pete Townsend all the way: poetic, ironic, inscrutable at times, and often argumentative. My favorites are \\"Mike Post Theme\\", \\"Black Widow's Eyes\\" (with a sublime vocal performance by Roger!), \\"It's not enough\\" and \\"Man in a Purple Dress\\". The Wire and Glass mini-opera is enjoyable with just enough structure and coherence to make it believeable. This record is really essential for any Who Fan. I have always loved 70's era Who, and this CD harkens to that time when they were cranking out anthems. Ok, I'm biased, but Endless Wire was truly well-worth the wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameless","review":"This CD is an absolute train wreck; disrespecting the Who's legacy in every regard. Don't be fooled into thinking that you might hear something that even faintly resembles the power of Townsend and Co's earlier work. Instead, what you get after waiting 20+ years is recycled, derivative music coupled with nearly incomprehensible lyrics that hint at things I, for one, wish to know nothing about -- \\"man in a purple dress\\", \\"meet me in the ether\\", etc. This CD is a sad, sad way to waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Don't listen to any of the positive reviews of this CD. The reviewers are suffering from the results of too many years of indulging in recreational drugs.You know the face people make when they suck on a lemon? That's the kind of face you'll be making if you're unfortunate enough to hear this CD. I'm not kidding. It's that bad.I have just about every Who album ever recorded and have been a fan since I was a teenager. I saw the Who in 1976 at Madison Square Garden back when Keith Moon was still around. Trust me when I say this album reeks.But don't take my word for it. Check to see how many copies are selling used on Amazon and look at the prices they're selling for. People can't give 'em away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who am I","review":"How sad. This CD could best be used as a frisbee-replacement. Roger Daltry has lost his voice, Pete Townshend's guitar playing is just about non-existent. When the Who lost Keith Moon and John Entwhistle, they lost their heart and driving force. Some groups don't know when to quit. Listen to Who's Next, the Who Sell Out, or Live at Leeds and then this and it is obvious they have run out of gas and are giving us gas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give It UP","review":"Roger Daltrey sounds terrible. I am a huge The Who fan, but this is it. They were done after Who Are You?. It is time for them to give it up. Only buy for Pete Townshend's writing and playing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the WHO I grew up with","review":"The latest from The Who is not that great. The DVD that comes with it is ok but it is painfull and sad to see Roger straining to hit the notes. Still in all it is the Who."},{"rating":"1","title":"endless dudd","review":"I just picked up this cd after waiting for 24 years. I was really looking forward to listening to it especially after listening to Wire and Glass. I was hoping this would sound like Quadraphinia or Face Dances, but i found that most of the songs were boring and seamed to lack direction and focus. Even the dvd was not up to the Who's usual standards! The dvd consists of half a dozen lackluster performances that were filmed in lion France earlier this year. I'm so sorry for this negative review because I'm a huge fan of the Who! I really wish I could add something positive or at least less harsh, but all I can say is that THIS CD STINKS!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Endless Ire","review":"Pete Townsend said that he would not write a new album unless he thought it was good enough. He thought wrong. In my opinion, there are no memorable melodies that will stick in your mind. Both Roger and Pete's voices are straining and unemotional. Much of the lyrics are bland. The only redeeming quality of this album is Townsend's acoustic guitar playing. It's beautiful and richly complex. But that is not enough to make the album listenable. It is, however, enough to earn the album one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"I cannot think of a more disappointing cd","review":"This is really an awful disc. I prefer Roger Daltrey's solo stuff. After so many years I truly had high expectations. Oh Ijust thought of a more disappointing CD. David Bowie's Tin Man releases. Now those set me up not to be disappointed about anything else he ever releases at least. Endless Wire has done the same to me for the Who. They are done. Sometimes I have to admit it. We are all getting older. But Dylan still writes as well as he did 20 years ago, McCartney still has some great stuff, David Byrne still has it in him, the Stones don't write many great songs anymore but they sure can rock. The word is the Who's recent tour kicks butt as well. I didn't bother to buy a ticket though. I'd hate to have to sit through 2 hours of endless wire. I can't even recommend one cut, and I used to love the Who and Pete Townsend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible and Embarrassing","review":"Poor Roger Daltrey has lost his voice and the material provided by Pete Townsend is bland and boring. Only bright spot is \\"It's Not Enough\\" Watching the DVD is painful, absolutely painful. Bust out the old Cd's or see a tribute band. Without Keith Moon & the mighty John Entwistle they are an old empty shell..."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A PIECE OF CRAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I listened to this garbage 3 times over the weekend. I think I was hoping it wasn't as bad thought it was the previous time, but I was wrong. These guys should have stayed retired in 1982. Anyone who hasn't bought this yet, DON'T!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I think I'm going to listen to my kids Wiggles cd, it's a lot better than this junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dirty Rotten Scoundrels","review":"The lousisest album of the year 2006. 'We got a hit' is alright.Its unbelievable that 'The Who' cut this disasterous album. I wonder if all that theyve been smoking have damaged their musical brains.I wouldnt have anything to do with this album even if someone gave it to me for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Better You Bet The Worst From The Who Who","review":"I receive this compact Discs for Christmas from a Co-worker. I did appreciate it but this compact disc is very boring and slow for the music of the who and put you to sleep fast. I'm glade that I receive it as a gift and I don't have the gluts to tell the person that gave it to that the disc sucks at all cost. Please dont 24 years again put out trash Peter for this is You better you bet a Bad CD and a sleeping pill from you"},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good reunion album","review":"The WHO sound tired and uninterested, espessially live they are horrible.....whatever happened to this great band. This album does not suck as much as \\"It's Hard\\" but it's close. The Who's best songs can all be heard on a greatest hits package, the other 90% of their output is filler or boring drivel. The one song I liked here was \\"Man In A Purple Dress\\" but even that only makes this album as a whole worth one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my Who back!","review":"What the heck we're they thinking with this album? Too folksy, artsy fartsy. After all the many years waiting for a studio album, I was very disappointed. I wanted to smash my guitar. This is what happens when half the band die."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Who Album!","review":"This is classic Who. I know John and Keith were a huge part of the Who, but now that they are gone, does that mean the Who cannot put out good music? NO! This has a 3.5 right now, and it deserves a 4.5, so lets get some positiive reviews up there. I am going to put this in the top 4 who albums. Right behind Quaprohenia, Who's Next, and Tommy, in that order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some Good... Some Not So Good","review":"First off, let me say that I really love the way this album is laid out. The \\"mini-opera\\" was a brilliant concept... no doubts there.Secondly, I wish this album were better! The music is pretty simplistic (for you musicians.. there is simply too much I-IV-V) and the lyrics are only slightly better (although they often resort to really \\"redneck\\" lingo and unpolished words like \\"crap\\".) I really can't recommend this album.That being said, \\"Trilby's Piano\\" is achingly beautiful, and \\"Fragments\\" is close to brilliant (the synth recalls the earlier days of \\"Yes\\".)Sadly, the bulk of this album only warrants a 2 out of 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Who Rocks","review":"After the disappointing new songs on The Who-Then And Now, Endless Wire is a very pleasant surprise. It's not quite as powerful as the classic albums, and shows a more subdued, mellower writer in Pete Townshend, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The two Who frontmen are still quite capable of creating that great Who sound, and its here. If you can get the Best Buy version with the Live At Lyon bonus disc you get to hear mix of classic Who along with the some new material performed in July of 2006. All in all this album is worth picking up for any Who fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Who are back!","review":"Wow! I was not expecting such an accomplished album from the remmants of this legendary band, in fact I was expecting the worst. I should have known better. \\"Endless Wire\\" is a testament to Pete Townsend's songwriting prowess and Roger Daltry's vocal abilities. The music and lyrics have a definite punch that has not been heard in the realm of hard rock in many, many years. As one previous reviewer said a lot has changed since The Who's last studio effort. With all the corporate pop/hip-hop drek that litters the music world these days it is refreshing to hear that real rock is not dead. We need The Who now more than ever to lift music out of the wasteland. Long live rock!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I the only one who doesn't like this album?","review":"I really was looking forward to this, but anticipated something a little more \\"The Who\\" like. \\"We Got A Hit\\"? I wouldn't be so sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"NVSH","review":"24 years should be enough time to come up with SOMETHING new, but there is Nothing Very Special Here. Townshend has always had a pretty narrow range and he hasn't broken through any boundaries on this album. ('A Man In A Purple Dress' is pretty gutsy, and I detect a decidedly Anderson-esque bend toward a Christian world view. I like that; you might not) If you must spend your money, pop for the W/DVD version. This CD will get one more listen and then, I suspect, sit on the shelf ever after. If any more come out, I won't be fooled again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who are they?","review":"No matter how much technical mastery, no matter what kind of legendary instrumentalists are performing, and no matter if they can still sing or not, if the songs aren't there, then it is not worthy of repeated listenings.There's no hooks, there's no anthems, there's no inspiring melodies.And without the songs, the Who becomes very pedestrian indeed.If you're a die hard Who fan that has to own everything they've ever released, then buy this one and store it away, cause there ain't much here worth listening to more than once.If you're not, pass this one by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the WHO I hoped for","review":"This CD had high hopes of the old WHO and the WHO of now, but the songs all sounded the same, no energy, no WHO, don't get me wrong I love the WHO, but this could have been better."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the He** is this??? NOT The Who","review":"After 35+ years as a Who fan, all I can say is Keith and John must be rolling over retching at this tripe. This has to be the worst excuse for a Who album. This whole effort lacks any energy or even one power chord of old. Pete, what happened?? you wuss!! This would have been better released as a Pete Townsend concept album, Not The Who. Don't waste your money on this, just remember the Who with fond memories of old. Oh and Roger and Pete, don't trip over your skirts playing anything on this album Live........"},{"rating":"2","title":"WHOLIGANS RETURN ON HALLOWEEN","review":"JUST ANOTHER TRICKY DAY FOR YOU.A major retail outlet offers an exclusive to this CD purchase at B.B.where available- an additional CD with 7 BONUS LIVE TRACKS.

Nothing to get to excited about but not to bad.The songs are just OK. In the DVD it sounds like Roger had a \\"bad day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"changed in a good way...except for the vocals","review":"Endless Wire lacks the true vigor of the original Who. The acoustics of the songs are slower and jazzier which is different from the original Who but still good. Pete Townshends creativity and skill definitely show through from all the different instruments that he plays and all the new melodies.However it is the vocals that bring the record down. In both the recorded tracks and the DVD Rogers voice sounds strained and old. His vocal range is limited to lower notes and his voice no longer contains the power, vitality, or rebellion that once was what the Who rocked about.I had heard many good reviews for this album and I was very disappointed in what I got. The return of the Who is a dream come true for many devoted fans but to me, Roger just doesn't have it anymore. I would support Pete Townshend in creating his own album but that would mean the Who would no longer be. Oh well, let's just move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do they give zero stars?","review":"They should have died before they got old. Not in any way making light of the passings of John Entwistle and Keith Moon, but this disc should have never been released. Truly a disappointment from Townshend (one of my favorite rock artists), and Daltrey's voice is totally shot. This is comparable to watching a baseball old-timer's game, except the old-timers don't take themselves seriously. As far as listening to any future Who material, I won't get fooled again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The Who are my favorite group, and \\"Live at Leeds\\" is my favorite album, but this CD is only marginally better than \\"It's Hard.\\" There are only a couple of songs that sound like The Who, but Pete and Roger sound tired. On the DVD, they look tired and sound less than enthusiastic. Zak Starky is a great drummer, but without Keith Moon and John Entwhistle, The Who just aren't the same. When Moonie died, they should have called it quits like Led Zeppelin did when Bonzo Bonham died."},{"rating":"1","title":"if there was a 0 that would be my rating","review":"Dont get me wrong im a who fan.I own al their recordings i mean all.But this is their worst recording.Roger cant sing anymore and townsend is unispired.Boys its time to hang your gloves.Pete you were right HOPE YOU DIE BEFORE YOU GET OLD.This month im going to see aerosmith hope they dont sound so bad as this who recording"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mess","review":"I've been a Who fanatic for 30 years. As a fan of all music, old / new, east / west I must say that this CD is just plain difficult to listen to without cringing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Get Fooled Again","review":"Look, I wanted The Who to put out another great record as badly as anyone else. But Endless Wire makes It's Hard sound like Who's Next. The fact is this album is a relentless mess. It's cute to have the obvious nod to Baba O'Riely in the beginning of Fragments, but then it dives into thoughts that are silly (\\"a piece of you is a piece of me\\"). The album beats you over the head with the bogus ideas of religion with Man In The Purple Dress and Two Thousand Years. The \\"mini-opera\\" Wire & Glass justsound like ideas that never get fully developed. In The Ether sounds like Pete Townshend trying to do bad Tom Waits. Only in a few cuts like Black Widow's Eyes do we get a hint of the power that could have been on Endless Wire. Instead, it just feels endless."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK but not great","review":"I'm a huge Who fan. I've seen them live, and with Moon on drums too. This CD is just OK. My advice would be look for classic Who, if you don't own any CDs, and buy it. \\"Live at Leeds\\", \\"The Who By Numbers\\", \\"Tommy\\", \\"Quadrophenia\\" and of course \\"Who's Next\\". I guess when you get old you run of things to say. That's what seems to have happened to Pete Thownsend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who's This?","review":"Been a Who fan since around the time they lost Keith. Seen them in concert 13 or so times, met them, love them. Enjoyed later albums like Face Dances and It's Hard more than most. I wish I could agree with those Who fans on here who have really turned on to this album. It hasn't happened for me yet. Yes I know they're not really The Who anymore, they're the Who's Left, and Daltrey's voice is so hoarse Springsteen's laughing at him. But I'd still think Townshend could craft something sufficiently reminiscent of their older stuff to make this album decent. Care to try again, guys?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Who - Endless Wire","review":"Disappointing, all the The Who energy is lacking. There is no spark or continuity, some songs are good though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"I wanted to like this I really did. I love the song good looking boy that they did in 2004 on a best of collection and I thought yeah they still have it. Then I got this and I thought no they really don't. This is by far the worst record they have ever done. I could go on but what would be the point. Trust me save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who? What?","review":"Bought this album and was very disappointed. Beware, very spotty material. Too much navel gazing and not enough rock. The single was my fav. but I sold this album as soon as I could. Just saw them in Boston in November so I know they still alive and kicking. Rumor that they will put out another album in near future. I won't buy it until I hear it on Amazon sampler first."},{"rating":"2","title":"the Lifehouse Method","review":"I am a Who fan, have been since 1979.I have listened/viewed \\"Endless Wire (w/DVD)\\" once, so far.I wonder \\"Who might enjoy this new WHO album?\\"Other WHO fans? most likely.Fans of the \\"classic-rock FM-radio genre\\"? probably not.Tom Waits-style folksters and new-age yuppyfied-hippysters? by all means.This Who album might just be another chapter in the \\"Lifehouse\\" project. Yes, that's it: Lifehouse...has now come full-circle...a Townshend home studio idea/Meher Baba \\"Who Came First\\" germination, then a proposed Who project, then \\"Who's Next\\" picks up the pieces, then turned ongoing-Townshend solo project for over three decades \\"Psychoderelict\\", now turned back over to an absolutely-Townshend-dominated Who....yeah, that's it, exactly. If you enjoy the Lifehouse idea, you will most likely enjoy this interesting new WHO cd.[...]thank you for your attention to this matter at this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who are The Who without Keith Moon???","review":"Many Who fans acknowledged this, but it seems to me that not enough have understood this concept. Pete writes majority, it not close to all their music, but without Kieth... there is no energy. They haven't released anything good since his death in 1980. There is no drummer that could possibly replace Keith of the Who.The Who (of the 2000's) should go under a different name because The Who isn't quite Who when Keith isn't their. This material is annoying, the lyrical content lacks in concept and direction. Sorry, but I don't think the members live up to the title \\"Endless Wire\\" because this album marks one of their worst efforts (I guess it's better than \\"Face Dances).\\"That said, this album isn't too bad, but it just isn't the Who. My Who died in 1980. Their last great effort was \\"The Whoo by Numbers.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"One of those albums that grows on you","review":"Upon first listen I was disapointed like some of the reviewers here. In todays society one is quick to judge something and move on to the next form of entertainment. I urge those who gave this a negative review to give it a few more listens. Some of the songs really do grow on you and if you bother to find out the meanings behind the songs its even better. Christ these guys are in their 60s and people expect them to sound like they did in the 60s. Daltry and Townshend sound great in my opinion. Not as many rockers as the classic albums but still a solid effort. The length of some of the better songs was disapointing and one overlooked gem is the simple yet beautiful \\"You stand by me\\". No it isnt Tommy but a must have for any Who fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sick Album","review":"I heard one song off of this CD so I figured I'd buy it and try it out.

I prefer to remember Fonda as Tom Joad in The Grapes of Wrath, The Ox-Bow Incident, Twelve Angry Men, Fort Apache or any of his marrvelous performances. Yes, we all grow old and die.The one redeeming feature of this film is that Jane Fonda at that time still had a great body. As for Hepburn, she was all right. Unfortunately, she nagged Spencer Tracy to also appear in his last movie, Guess Who's Coming to Dinner? At the time that movie came out, Mort Sahl made the comment, \\"What would have happened if she asked Stokley Carmichael to dinner?\\" Sorry for getting onto the wrong film, but while I am at it, I thought the latest Titanic, with its multimillion dollar budget was bested by a 1950's version made in England with a budget of about $52.

Melancholy from start to finish, film shows what it iswe all have to fear; and does so with courage and dignity. We see the passing of the torch, the apologia's, love, denial, acceptance, grief, and forgiveness. Yet it was the humourous backdrop that forced tears from my eye. I think it takes a measure of maturity to truly appreciate this film.

This is a great movie about relationships, and dying, but in a comical way.I really liked Henry Fonda (\\"good...GOD!\\") the best, and the movie really focussed on him. Katharine Hepburn was good, too (duh, they both got Oscars), but I found Jane Fonda was a downer. I understand real-life flowing into the characters and all that, but a) she was depressed, or depressing, take your pick b) she was on display during her bikini scenes (you could tell she was posing) and c) can hair get any bigger? (well, it was the 80's).If you like guns and car chases, this is not the movie for you. If you like thoughtful dialogue, some swearing by young and old, and some interesting things to think about, then you probably will like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better with the sound turned off.","review":"I have so much respect for Kathryn Hepburn's work that I was felt sorry for her putting up with this disrespect even as a character.The language was so foul and assultive (is that a word?) that it was ruined for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remake in 3-D","review":"They need to remake this in 3-D.

This film gave Fonda his only Best Actor Oscar. It is a great story about an old couple who are take care of a teenager while their daughter goes on vacation with the boy's father. The acting is phenomenal, superb, excellent and every other synonym. One should play close attention to the relationship on camera between the characters of Jane (who plays the daughter) and Henry Fonda. Jane Fonda actually bought the rights of the movie so that her father could play the lead. Jane has said that this film help resolve many issues between father and daughter. This movie also marks the first time Hepburn and Henry Fonda worked together. During the movie he wears a hat which belonged to Spencer Tracy. Hepburn did all her won stunts, including the diving into the cold water (she was an adept swimmer). The movie is just great, it is very well acted, it has an amazing story and it is a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adjustable wrench review","review":"The item is just what I wanted, and my husband was very pleased with it on Father's Day, and commented on the good quality of the product.

Is it worth drawing the public's attention to a book that is, at best, descriptive journalism which promises more than it delivers? Only after reading the book did I acquaint myself with the author's journalistic reputation which helped explain some of my original disappointment with the book. As an academic, I cannot recommend this book to any serious reader interested in matters concerning the Windsor family. The book lacks proper endnotes and citations. Botham rarely identifies his sources but chooses convincing descriptive labels that suggest authoritative individuals with first hand knowledge. I am disappointed in Botham's \\"soap opera\\" treatment of a topic that is of genuine interest to many in the British Commonwealth.

The subject matter interested me but the dialog in the book is just silly. Very contrived. A much better book with this subject matter is by Nora Roberts, who writes a million times better, called \\"Dance Upon the Air.\\" Her subjects and dialog ring true, unlike Fern Michaels'. I was glad Helen became a strong woman by the end but I found the whole way she dealt with her husband to be far fetched. This book also has one of the worst editing jobs I've seen in a while. Sam's eyes are the bluest eyes she's seen and two pages later, he has a warm brown gaze. Then there's a whole paragraph about Max, the dog, and the next paragraph starts out, \\"She ran into his arms.\\" The dog's arms? Oh, no, it's Sam again. It makes it hard to follow.

It was chilling to read about what Helen was going through with her husband when he attacked her. It was heartbreaking to read how she felt worthless, and he felt justified. But the story around them did not hold up. Interesting, but not plausible. All the pieces fit together too neatly, and the ending was just a fairy tale. (Poor girl inherits millions and makes up with her estranged mother.) The characters' relationships with each other were not clearly explored. We understood why Helen's benefactor loved animals, but we had no clue why she befriended battered women. And Helen's decisions when trying to flee her husband are just plain stupid. I like stories with happy endings, but I want them to be believable. This book was a good read, but the ending was just too tidy. By the way, I lived in NJ for many years and it almost never snows before Christmas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful......I put it down!","review":"After reading a previous book by Michaels called \\"Celebration\\" which I would give 2 stars, I decided to read this one, what a bore! I never even finished it! Don't even care how it ended. I will not be reading anymore books by Michaels."},{"rating":"1","title":"A predictable formula","review":"This book is so predictable. The dialog is unnatural and repetitive. I love animals, but the huge emphasis on the two dogs in this story adds to the air of unreality. Romance novels are not by definition \\"reality\\" reading. However, this book does not even have a gripping story and is poorly written in comparison to other writers of this genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really my cup of tea","review":"This is the first book that I've read written by Fern Michaels. I would have to say that the first few chapters kind of caught my attention. However, as the story developed - I kind of lost interest in it. I'm not really into the character who seems to be not thinking straight - like I don't understand why she took Sam's pet Max when she went to the shelter when Max isn't hers in the first place. Anyway, I didn't finish the book because I didn't think there's a point. I'm pretty sure it had a happy ending. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, riveting start but can't hold it for long","review":"When I first started to read this book I found myself unable to put it down. The brutality of the husband and how Helen escapes was great. But, unfortunately, the story started to fall flat after a while. I really had a hard time believing how smart those two dogs, Max and Lucie were. The last straw was when Helen was loading the two dogs in the car. Max (THE DOG) buckled in Lucie (THE DOG) and then himself!!! Come on! I don't care how smart a dog he is supposed to be, there is no way he can do this! I was amazed that he didn't drive the car also. Have to agree with other reviewers that some of the dialogue was just plain silly and sometimes hard to follow. Too bad...the beginning had so much promise."},{"rating":"1","title":"What I SHOULD have wished for...","review":"Was for this book to be over sooner. I am not one to write bad reviews just for the sake of writing them (in fact, this is my first one). However, I was astounded by the monotony and flatness of the characters and dialect in this book. I found myself reading it aloud to my husband to laugh at the absurdity of the conversations between characters. The whole thing made me feel like the writer had no confidence in her reader's intelligence and had to spell out every single thing.

Aside from the Clarks cover there is not a single other song worth buying on this tribute. I mean come on Elvis Costello singing Springsteen get real.

It is really absurd that they quit listing the track titles along with the albums.

For some reason people wonder why the record retail industry is suffering."},{"rating":"1","title":"So uneven a tribute","review":"In my opinion Springsteen's magic is the mood he captures in his stories.

Dan Bern's version of Thunder Road, Bullens on \\"If I should fall behind\\" and Patty Griffin's \\"Stolen car\\" which she has on her cd '1,000 kisses' are some of the ones that worked for me.

The only cover I didn't like was Jason Ringenberg's version of \\"My Hometown.\\" His vocals made me feel like it was about vacationers leaving Martha's Vineyard on Labor Day weekend - definitely not a working class version.

The introduction to this movie is really funny. If you haven't done so already, pay attention to the golf cart! That isn't the last time you'll see it. Ernest's tolerance of the Second Chance boys is touching. I listen to \\"I'm Glad It's Raining\\" every now and then to remember this movie. It's really nice to see a movie where everything comes out ok in the end. The war at the mining camp is a riot! Simple little things such as the turtle saying \\"I'm scared, sarge\\" adds to the humor. This movie would not be as good if you tried to apply logic to some of the actions or if you dissected the plot. Just enjoy it for the humor & caring!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good laughs","review":"This film finds Ernest as a handyman but wanna-be counselor at a boys' summer camp. A group of juvenile offenders is sent to the camp as \\"Second Chancers,\\" and of course Ernest ends up being their counselor. As a summer camp movie, the gags are a bit predictable- -the poison ivy scene, the animal scene, and the bad food scenes. Nevertheless, Varney's genius makes them fresh and funny.The subplot, the redemption of the Second Chancers, comprises the moral lesson of the movie. The main plot centers around the evil Krater Mine Company, which plots to take over the sacred land where the camp is located. The film itself is a bit more violent than most other Ernest films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius","review":"Ernest P. Worrell (Jim Varney) is the best thing to happen to the comedy genre since Cheech and Chong disappeared. Ernest is a camp counselor for a bunch of brats.

The mood and motif of the film were far more rudimentary than other Varney classics. I felt that the story arc left much to be desired and the cinematography was slightly contrived. While I cannot recommend that anyone avoid seeing this film, I do want to express my severe disappointment at what I felt could have been the crowning jewel in the cinema oeuvre of Jim Varney.

Pretty goofy, but better for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cinematic Perfection","review":"Why Jim Varney was overlooked for an Oscar for his portrayal of Ernest is a mystery to me. This film is pure comedic genius which rivals that of Charlie Chaplin and Lauryl and Hardy. The premise of the film is simple enough. Ernest longs to be a camp counselor where he works as a maintenance man. The hijinx are a plenty as Ernest takes on a group of tough misfit kids. This heart of gold maintenance man can teach us all a lesson for what's really important in life, being true to who you are and having friends.

Paul Kidd does a good job with the returning characters of Justicar, Escalla, Polk, and Enid the Sphinx.While I found Kidd's WHITE PLUME MOUNTAIN to be a more humorous, fast-flowing novel, DESCENT is still a fine read. Kidd does a good job in personalizing the adventure for the protagonists: a problem with Escalla's family and her duties to them leads ultimatley to the party's descent into the earth to fight the dreaded drow.I highly recommend that you read WHITE PLUME MOUNTAIN first, because Kidd doesn't do much back-tracking to explain how these unusual characters came to be together.

Full of humor to the end, as well.If you've played Dungeons & Dragons and/or played this module, that's even more of a plus.

I ask for a refund and the customer service rep promised to send me a check.

Anyway, this was my introduction to the piece, \\"Soon\\". It blew me away at the time. Little did I know that it was an excerpt from a much longer song, \\"The Gates Of Delirium\\", all of which, or even the original \\"Soon\\" part were far better on the original album, \\"Relayer\\".

Jon's voice doesn't need any help.Chris Squire's \\"Amazing Grace\\" is a strong bass solo.Chris Squire & Alan White's \\"Whitefish\\" is great solo medley.

Mostly solos from individual members and just a few songs? Are they kidding?! This should at least have everything that was on the 9021live video, but in my honest opinion, this would be a great cd if it contained the ENTIRE concert. It should even include stuff that they didn't include on the cd OR video. Songs like Yours Is No Disgrece, Long Distance Runaround, and Roundabout were played on this tour. But they don't appear on anything. 9012Live should be a 2cd set containing the full show. Maybe in the future they'll release it that way. Unfortunately, this is the only live cd that has Rabin and Kaye. Until they release this the way it should be, if you want a live Yes cd, the best ones are Live at the House Of Blues (House Of Yes, or whatever it's called) or Yessongs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good so good if you love 80's sounds and YES!!","review":"Ok it isn't the goodest Cd of yes but!!

I've followed the series from the start (Flight from the Dark)up to Legacy of Vashna and in my opinion, Masters of Darkness is the book I remember most vividly. Within it is the adventure in which Lone Wolf actually stops messing around and confronts all the major Darklords in a battle worthy of legend (even in terms of this series, it is a wonderful climax plot-wise). Highly recommendable, fun, and a must-have by fans for fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yogananda Magus","review":"The author asserts that he is equal or even superior to Jesus Christ. To me, however, he seems to be more in a spiritual tradition of Simon Magus, the witch of Endor, the Egyptian priests who fought Moses, the priests who fought Elia, the Greek Pythagoras, the Iranian Zoroaster, the German D. Faustus, etc. The difference between these magi and Yogananda is that they never asserted to be equal to Jesus Christ. On the contrary, the three magi from the Orient who came to Jesus birth acknowledged His superiority and prayed to Him as the Son of God. Yogananda, on the other hand, tries to make Jesus someone of his lot and belittle him by this. Through this it seems that we have come to a new level of magicians' tricks of deception targeted at humble followers of Jesus Christ. Yogananda seems to be one of the leaders of this new school of magic. It is astonishing, however, that people like Yogananda cannot do without Christ."},{"rating":"1","title":"AN INTERESTING BOOK INDEED","review":"This 1946 edition is ok, but a bit incomplete compared to the improved version with the orange cover. Yogananda Himself revised much of Autobiography and removed most data about communities before his passing in 1952. He also added a 49th chapter which is missing from this 1946 edition. if you want to see the masters best work you will have to look beyond this page."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great disappointment","review":"As a fan of the Self-Relization centers in Los Angeles, I was very eager to read this book and learn about the founder. I was expecting insight into his philosophies and reasons for building this centers. However, what I found was a book of supposed miracles. For someone incredibly religious (and perhaps Christian, since the author makes a great effort to quote the Bible often to make his book more accessible to Christian readers), this may be a worthwhile book. But as a autobiography, the claims are outlandish and fantastical."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: This is NOT the Ben Kingsley version!","review":"I inadvertantly purchased this audiobook, believing it to be the much lauded version narrated by Ben Kingsley. IT IS NOT - don't get the abridged version if you are buying based on the reviews provided here. There's alot missing from this version - and it does not flow like Yoganandas original.

This was the book that answered all the life questions my Christian upbringing couldn't or didn't want to. Yogananda actually helped me to understand and respect Christianity more than any minister had. He confirmed as true the persistent whisper within of something more in life than what we see.

But by the third time I had read it I had many of my own miracles occur in my life and they came due to the wisdom contained in this book and others like it.

You do not know what those crimes are. You do not know who you were in your former life. You do not even believe in such a thing as a former life. You get no chance to defend yourself against the crimes you supposedly have committed. There is no trial, there is no carefully selected jury. All there is, is a verdict, your pain, and this person who is accusing you of your alleged sins. And to make his point this person tells you about his and his friends mighty powers. In what situation are you? In Stalin's interrogation chamber? In the hands of the Mob? Wrong! You are reading Yogananda's book philosophising about Karma! Yoga might be a powerful tool for some people, but its ethics, as they appear in this book, are less than doubtful. They lack a sense for justice, freedom and an open heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"A WORK OF FICTION","review":"The panegyrics stinks.Individualistic biases and notions of the famed author-guru built and sustained VERY BIASED and very romantic notions that later cramped and hampered a realistic outlook on the nation India, Indians, and *having sex* - which is not specially advocated in the book - and far, far less among monks and nuns that publish it.

Well, he better is, otherwise he is not more than a mere psychopath.Also, what he tells us about yoga is quite one-sided. For instance, he seems to be rather asexual. He doesn't say anything about tantra or Shiva yoga, a form of yoga the famous orientalist and hindu Alain Dani��lou preferred (\\"Yoga. Method of Reintegration\\" or \\"Shiva and Dionysus\\"). What is striking is that the demonic aspects of yoga are completly left out. But you do open yourself up to demons if you practise yoga, as the brahman R.R. Maharaj (\\"Escape into the Light\\") has shown. Yoganandas approach seems to be specifically tailored for an scientifically oriented western audience. The spiritual dangers of yoga are totally surpessed.During my research on Indian culture I came across the classic \\"Christ of the Indian Road\\" by E. Stanley Jones. This is the book I liked best. I found it extremly sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully uplifting!","review":"What a delightful subject and a delightfully written and compiled book. I loved every minute of it.

Walking in another's footsteps is always interesting, but when those footsteps are taking you into the world of the miraculous it can become an experience of inner transformation. Yogananda relates the early experiences in his childhood search for an enlightened teacher and his 10 years with a yoga master. In today's world, the message of the underlying unity behind all religions is stronger than ever and his explanation of the subtle laws behind ordinary and extraordinary events, which we usually call miracles, echoes the voices of the quantum physicists of today.For more information, visit [...].Rahasya Poe, Lotus GuideTo Believe Or Not To Believe: The Social and Neurological Consequences of Belief Systems"},{"rating":"2","title":"You won't want to put it down.","review":"This is the type of book that once you begin to read it, you won't want to put it down.

This book introduced me to sprirituality (so I feel). But the best part was that it gave me a path to move on, a base to investigate furthur. It appealed to me to move ahead. This book convinces you a great extent that (probably) GOD does exists. The only way one can be sure He does, is by trying to get to Him. This book gives you a first hand experience of a great Soul who did find HIM. Justice will only be done if all of those who read this book move on the same path. I have read a couple of more autobiographies of Yogis and they all look very similar and therefore confirm that there is a firm and known route to God. Indeed the similarity is so close, that, one can feel that the others did copy these ideas. But the other autobiographies are from different decades and centuries.

One book, and one he reads every year according to the book is Autobiography of a Yogi.I put the audio book on my iPhone and listened on a sunny bike ride. I can remember a tale of the author visiting a guru who was so strong, he could defeat a lion with his bare hands.Wanting to hear the tale again, I started the book from the beginning creating an image in my mind of each word. I pictured in my mind him telling his sister he will have a boil on his body tomorrow. He does. Then he tells her that kites being flown nearby will fall from the sky - chopped in battle by fellow kite flyers - and fall into his hands. They do.According to Isaacson's biography, Jobs delayed taking conventional medical action for 9 months, relying on unconventional practices. He's dead.What is the merit of these tales?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertainment, Not Enlightenment","review":"The autobiography reads like \\"Arabian Nights\\", i.e. full of fantastical tales of miracles and adventures, filled with tiger-fighting superhumans, self-replication and teleporation, beautiful flying angels, aneroxic (i.e. non-eating) and exhibitionistic (i.e. naked) yogis revered as saints (provoking a lot of unintended laughters), and even a hoary story of wish-granting \\"Genie\\" presented as an actual event.It reminded me of \\"Shantaram\\", Gregory Roberts' fictionalized - and equally breathless - autobiography. It certainly makes for a pleasant reading but not an enlightening one. The author must have believed there's a sucker born every minute, and maybe he was right, as there appear to be people who believe every word in this book is accurate and true.Contrast this work with far more impressive 'Snow Leopard' by Mathiessen and Merton's \\"Seven Story Mountain\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"mysticism without substance","review":"Autobiography of a yogi is, to my mind, the ultimate example of zero infromation in a pretty long book. The book is full of stories about saints that perform countless miracles - most of which are truly unlikely, to say the least. What's more, they are unnecessary - why do we need to believe that a person can live without eating for several decades in order to find spirituality? Yogananda does not provide here a teaching, as many people claim, but rather an undiscriminating account of of his guru's miracels. Many of the chapters are convuluted and pointless. If you want to get a good understanding of hinduism and yoga, this is not the place. The book does have a level of interest in portraying India and its way of life, but other than that, it is no great catch."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Way!","review":"I will have to go against the flow, here.

Sorry, I don't think so.I am almost finishing the book and if it were sold as a fiction piece I would give it more credit.

At the outset of my sophomore year I made a declaration to solve all of Jesus's parables, hoping they can help me. I made this decision with such intensity that I stayed up many long nights analyzing the gospels. The 'next week' I picked up and read Autobiography of a Yogi. I have never read any literature on yoga before in my life and never intented to, so I find it miraculous.

After reading it, I knew for sure I would meditate for the rest of my life. Why? Because Paramahansa Yogananda said that the difference between the untrained mind and the focused mind of a meditator, was comparable to the difference between the scattered rays of a light bulb and the concentrated rays of a laser. I wanted my mind to have the sharpness of a laser. But that's just one of the qualities of a yogi I wanted to emulate. I also wanted their serenity, fierce courage and peaceful nature.

All of these editorial changes have taken place after Yogananda passed away in 1952. It is sad that SRF has chosen to change the writing of this great avatar to meet their own twisted goals.

The second it reinforced my beliefs about those changes. The third time I used reason, critical thinking and applied principles of logic that one would apply to any of these claims. Now this book is not from some antiquated time - it's not the hearsay and supposition that surrounds the story of Jesus and his miracles. If these things happened, then there are witnesses. We should have corroboration on a significant scale. The entire world should stand in awe that such an individual was among us. But what I found in this reading is we only have the authors word for the events that so amazed me all those years ago. As did Carlos Castaneda. As did Lobsang Rampa.

At a grand scale he describes in detail the saber rattling prelude, the intense diplomatic struggles, the regional and international propaganda battles, and the balancing act between the Soviet and American superpowers. At the smaller scale, we learn of incidents that involve simple political oversights, vanity and ego, and happenstance encounters that at first glance would seem to have little or no impact on the outcome. He weaves these together to connect a complete chain of events that pour gasoline into the tinderbox atmosphere of the 1967 Middle East.

They complement each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, Informative...Indispensable.","review":"This is a well-documented and well-written account that provides the reader with as much as they really need to know about this conflict. Sadly, there will be some that believe that Oren does not adequately represent the Arab \\"point of view\\" here. But Oren has done such a thorough job documenting this work that those readers will have to explain away a lot of hard fact to convincingly make that argument. (The maps could have been more comprehensive, though.) Final thought: there are so many different instances within this account where events appear to have been driven by \\"happenstance\\" (a letter not delivered, warnings not issued, etc.) that one must conclude that the Hand of G-d was [and is] all over this thing.

While Oren's style is slightly dry, he tries very hard to be objective, filling the book with information.Unfortunately, a better editor was needed for the book. As \\"Travis Bickle\\" pointed out, there are numerous spelling errors, including consistently spelling Gandhi as \\"Ghandi.\\" The most surprising error, though, is in the photographs- one of the photographs of Moshe Dayan is flipped, so there is one photograph where his patch is over his left eye and another photograph where his patch is over his right eye."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like the Six Years of Diplomacy and the Making of the Six Days of War","review":"About half the book (170 of 340 pages) is spent on the several years of developments leading to the war. A lot of diplomatic minutia. This detail may not be obvious in the description. I was expecting a little more on the war and developments after the war. Afterall, the title is \\"Six Days of War: 1967 and the Making of the Middle East\\". Ever read a book and you wonder when something is going to happen? Discussions in the Israeli cabinet leading to the war? 30-40 pages. Israeli airstrikes against the Egyptians? 3-4 pages, maybe. Buy it again? No."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"The book was a great way to learn about what happened in those days leading to the war, the war and the aftershocks.

I'm sorry \\"Michael Oren\\" had to retire to be able to write this book but the military would not have been happy with him if he was still in active service. I do not think he revealed any secret information. It's just nice we don't have a bunch of wimps working for our military. It's the politicians in DC that screw everything up. The book was well written and flowed very well. It was well organized, very few typo's and exciting to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated","review":"This book is outdated and contains many formerly believed myths about the 1967 war. Previously classified Johnson administration documentation was released from the U.S. State Department Office of the Historian in January 2004, which clearly proves that Israel attacked Eqypt even though Egypt was trying to avoid war using shuttle diplomacy. Most historians have not updated their work to reflect the diplomatic realities that have been documented during the days before the war, and this book is one of them.The book is great fictional story-telling for people who want to build Israeli nationalistic pride, but I would not recommend it if you are a serious historian."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well researched.","review":"Well written book in which the author tries to present all sides.

The book dissects the political realities underlying the war, the politics guiding the war and the political aftermath of the war.

Before you consider purchasing this case, I just want you to be aware of the construction of the case. This case is genuine leather, however the part that holds the phone to the case is clear plastic that is only slightly flexible. This plastic is sewn to the leather back piece. So when inserting the phone into the case the plastic tears fairly easily. I would recommend if possible to heat the plastic in someway(careful not to burn), then try inserting it, because it is difficult to slide phone into case due to an extremely tight fit and the natural high friction between the phones plastic and the cases plastic. All in all just be careful not to tear the plastic from the case, which is very easy to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful.....simply dreadful","review":"At the same time I ordered this movie and its sequel.

However, this movie was never part of the television series. This was a poor (extremely poor) attempt at telling the Lone Ranger story. Released in 1981, this movie forced Clayton Moore from his mask to dark sunglasses and made the one flop wonder Klinton Spilsbury a hated man among Lone Ranger fans. This movie gives all of the credit of creating the Lone Ranger to Tonto, even to the point of using a silver bullet, as the Lone Ranger could not shoot straight without silver in the bullets. In the end, even Christopher Lloyd as the bad guy couldn't save this movie. In the case of Amazon attaching all of the good reviews for the Clayton Moore movie to this poor attempt at story telling, Amazon has blown it big time.

The screen aspect would be preserved at a 2.35:1 [for the 16x9 fans]. Some of the extras would be outtakes, including the real voice track for Spilsbury.

A misguided script and plodding direction are the main culprits. The origin of the Lone Ranger can be summed up in a few minutes, yet the movie takes forever to get started. John Barry's uninspired score is further hampered by a ludicrous \\"ballad\\" from Merle Haggard.

I doubt the other imposters could carry that persona. Mr. Moore and his tv character is a hero and role model for us baby-boomers. Sad, sad day when he passed.

People cheered when he first wore the mask and \\"that\\" song came through the speakers, laughed at President Grant's threat to Col Custer to send him to Montana, marveled at Christopher Lloyd's villain Cavindish and Michael Horse's dignified Tonto.After seeing the movie I saw the televised review by two \\"Windy City\\" reviewers and was amazed at the inaccuracy of their description of several scenes. It made me wonder if they'd bothered to watch the film.Some have even described it as \\"Hoaky\\", if dignity, devotion, and duty are hoaky we need more hoaky.

Then we don't even know what the bad guy is up to until the last 15 minutes! Then we have Klinton Spilsbury, who has all the screen presence of a cabbage. I would like to know how the hell he got this part in the first place. It's no wonder he didn't make another film.I give this movie an extra star because of Christopher Lloyd, who is surprisingly good as the icy villain Cavandish.

I loved the Lone Ranger as a kid but the biggest problem with this movie (among many) is that actors/characters just take themselves WAY too seriously. When you read that all of Klinton Spilsbury's lines were dubbed (by the actor James Keach)and he never did another film after this you can see why. The Tonto character isn't bad but they had to throw in some 80's 'politically correct' dialogue into this film which kind of spoils the whole thing. To be fair how can you make an intersting hero out of the Lone Ranger in modern times, when he only wounds bad guys when he uses his gun?

As it is, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT the classic TV version...","review":"Unfortunately, if you're buying this version with the idea that you'll be treated to the adventures of Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels, you'll be sorely disappointed. this is the early 80's cinematic take on the Lone Ranger, starring Klinton Spilsbury -- and actor so bad his dialouge had to be dubbed by another actor in post-production.

First, the printer can only use one cartridge at a time and while it prints color pages beautifully, the black text is not too sharp when using the color cartridge and such a hassle to switch between two cartridges. Also, a few people have noted the price of the replacement cartridges... $35 for color and $30 for black. Don't bother looking for generic cartridges like the ones for Epsons and Canons cause there aren't any. The other problem with the printer is the way the sheets feed into it. Sometimes, two or three pages will feed into it and it will throw off the other pages already in the feeder, so you can't really leave the computer while you're printing out a 10 page report. As for the cheap cost of the printer, don't even fall for it. It's all a cheap ploy for Lexmark to force you into buying $35 ink cartridges for years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Z11 not for me","review":"I've had my Z11 for abt. 2 yrs., it came w/my puter.

Once tender and longing(Elegy), another time powerful-demanding (New Found Land) or sunken in dreams full of melancholy, if not even sadness (Leave's Eyes): the former Theatre of Tragedy singer appears in her best condition. As multiple as her voice are the guitars: from hard and heavy to accoustic sounds: All is offered. I am not sure if we may call this CD a contribution to Gothic metal: Too much folk influences are present, and the keyboards and samples stay in the background. There is only one aspect that makes me refuse the highest rating possible: Alex Krull simply cannot resist grunting. But at least he limits himself in this respect to two short passages in two songs (Nr. 4 and 6). His qualities as a producer, however, are more than obvious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rare highlights","review":"Even if this husband and wife Euro-goth-metal duo are touted as a better Evanescence or Lacuna Coil, it does not really say much when the huge majority of material still cannot escape so many of the genre cliches that keeps it just about as disinteresting as their companions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing artist","review":"I encountered Vineland Saga quite by chance and was amazed at their ability to mix Liv Kristine Espens amazing vocal talent with a totally unheard of brand of gothic rock.

HOWEVER, chuck is one of the worst albums I've bought in a long time. SUM 41 seems to have taken the gc route, meaning that they did away with all the punk influence of the previous albums and went straight for the sell-out experimental tactics of their peers. There is nothing catchy or memorable about chuck, and it rivals good charlottes horrid chronicals of life and death as the WORST album released in 04'.

Musically, they have progressed even further than their earlier efforts, maintaining the fine balance between raw rock and listenability. In this CD, their message is even darker than their previous work, and feel more personal in nature. While Fat Lip, Still Waiting, and In Too Deep had lyrics that felt universal, this CD feels more specific. But the beat and crunchy guitars don't disappoint. Sum 41 takes the best of punk, surf music and rock and roll it all up into a very tight, disciplined package. Well done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage","review":"Sum 41 is on the way out.

Their fans are simply getting tired of the band. These guys have about as much staying power as the Spice Girls or Hanson. Remember those groups?

The energy is still there, all the way up to the final song, \\"88\\". Sum 41 signs off with a creepy ending that ties this whole album together.The messages in this song are great, and Whibley sings the songs with conviction.

Since \\"Does this look infected?\\" however, I've changed my mind. Chuck is quite possibly one of the worst albums ever released by a pop punk band. Where most songs are not even close to technically appealing, most are downright bad. For instance, the song, \\"Pieces\\" is simply a ripoff with even the same chord progression format as Coldplay's \\"The Scientist\\". Sum 41 either needs to get original or get out because another album like this and I will lose all faith in the bands that the modern music industry is promoting."},{"rating":"1","title":"not really bad but not good either","review":"Ok first off let me start by saying I am new to Sum 41. I never heard any other of their previous albums and after listening to this one, I don't really have the desire to do so. It is true that Sum 41 copied a lot of other bands on Chuck but that doesn't really matter to me. If a band plays good and makes good music I don't really care how or from who they got their ideas. I didn't really like the album mostly becuase I don't like their style of music. Almost all the tracks sound the same, you can't tell one from another. Also, most of the tracks have beats that are too fast for my liking. I only enjoyed 4 tracks on the album: 5, 8, 11, 12.

Compared to the other ones, I think this one is my favorite. Sum 41 has this vocalist with the most addictive voice, like Billie Joe Armstrong from Green Day and Brandon Flowers from the Killers.

But then, I hate all intrumental intros, so yeah..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better","review":"This is only Sum 41 album I have liked, the rest just had random good songs (ie, Pain For Pleasure). Finally Sum 41 shows their true colors with the best track, \\"The Bitter End\\". Not all the other songs are as intense, and the intro of 88 is a HUGE RIPOFF OF \\"Victory\\" by Megadeth (listen to the bridge). But is a sweet riff though, so its alright.

It is brilliant! The best thing about it though is the Soundtrack including such great numbers as \\"Until he kissed me\\" by The Crystals and The one in the bar called \\"Babysitter Blues\\" (Or something like that)!

And it really does have a good reason to be rated PG-13. It's a great movie. You'll have the most spookiest adventure.This is actually a freaky babysitting movie.The whole movie starts out as Chris Parker's friend Brenda (Penelpe Ann-Miller) ran away from home to a bus station, and then when Chris Parker (Elisabeth Shue) drives to the town with the kids and then (BOOM!!!!)Flat Tire!!! That's how it starts out.Very scary indeed.This can be a movie for all scary movie lovers.The English title is called \\"A Night On Town.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"An 1980's classic","review":"The 1980's brought us a lot of wonderful teen movies.

Especially when only two of them are good. A Death Grip on Yesterday had me screaming at my cd player. Their emo crap made me cringe. It was clear the record label pushed them in a certain direction just because their drummer has an amazing singing voice.When I saw them live in 05' they were touring off The Curse, excellent energy and they played with a great metal band with the likes of Unearth. Suicide Notes is one of the best metal albums by a very young band at the time (see Poison the Well's Opposite of December). It makes me sad the direction they went in. Unfortunately, after reading a brief review, I'm sure their new album sucks too.If you want to listen to metal, get Parkway Drive, Unearth, In Flames, Lamb of God, Himsa, Shattered Realm, August Burns Red, or the new Megadeth album. Those are kickass, Atreyu sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Atreyu ,but honestly.","review":"Okay first off atreyu is awesome, i love the band. Seriously though, a best off. They have 3 albums and and ep out. Now the music on here is good but it's missing a few tracks. For instance Rememberance Ballad, Shameful, and My fork in the road(your knife in my back). This is clearly a Victory records idea to get as much money from the Atreyu brand while they can. and what better way than exploiting the catalogue of songs then a best of album."},{"rating":"1","title":"why???","review":"ok.. i love atreyu. seriously.. i have an atreyu tattoo.. but there is NO NEED for a GH album already.. seems like they just want some quick cash. the album cover sucks.. and this really just isnt neccessary!"},{"rating":"1","title":"These guys are a joke....","review":"You know Destructions Thrash ANthems just came out too, buy that and see where real metal came from."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Just A Cash Scam","review":"You seriously think this band should get a best of CD this early? Or even get a best of CD? Personally, I can only tolerate their pre-Curse stuff, when the band used less polished production and didn't resort to lame pop-punk. But anyways, even if you are an Atreyu fan or not, don't buy this. It's just the Victory records discography minus a few tracks, and a real fan would obviously have all of their works.Also, they forgot the \\"Fractures\\" and \\"Visions\\" EP tracks as well (I know they weren't released on Victory...). If you want to make something worthy, at least re-release your older EP's on a CD so that the fans can get a taste of the band's early days.Avoid this, Atreyu fan or not. This is just another way for Victory Records to rake in the cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"For a newcomer fan that doesn't own any albums","review":"This album (video material not included) should only be purchased by people that own any other Atreyu albums. Yeah, it's because they are leaving Victory, but if you own any of their three major releases, you already own one third of this. It doesn't even have \\"Her Portrait In Black\\", which may add some form of redemption to its purchase being as it's not really available on an album already.If it's your first Atreyu album, go for it. If it's not, leave it be."},{"rating":"1","title":"church of engkland","review":"this book is blatantly anti Anglicanism, and a bit of over dramaticing his own effectiveness as an Anglican priest. i'm surprised the Church put up with him as long as they did.

There is some feeble blues rock with Milkcow Blues Boogie other wise there is a lot of hyperactive rock and roll. It hasn't improved any with time. In fact, the sound is quite dated.

It was a very intimate but very powerful show.My personal opinion, I think Sam has gone 360 degrees in the other direction -- in terms of music. I love the lush production on \\"Martinis and Bikinis\\". I favor the Beatlesque passion over the stripped down production on \\"Fan Dance\\"Maybe this is a detour in an otherwise majestic catalog of fine pop music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sam needs the studio magic from Burnett","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this CD. I thought sparse production would be a plus for Ms. Phillips. How wrong I was. Bring back the production, add some interesting noises, more instruments -- anything to add some melody to this effort. My favorite CDs from Sam Phillips are \\"Cruel Inventions\\" and \\"Martinis & Bikinis\\" -- both of which are sonically impressive. \\"Fan Dance\\" is dull and not one song sticks in your head after repeated listenings. There are many female artists that can wow audiences with just their songs,their voice and an acoustic guitar -- Rosanne Cash, Emmylou Harris, Lucinda Williams, Rickie Lee Jones...to name a few. Unfortunately, Sam Phillips is not in their class. At least not with this effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"We miss Leslie Phillips","review":"Leslie Phillips was better using her artistic talents to worship the Lord. What a disappointment.

Horrible, and I wouldn't recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cello rock","review":"OK, so there's a cello in only one of the numbers. I just seem to keep hearing one throughout. This was my first taste of Sam Phillips, and it's not something I'd grab to play while looking through my CD rack. I appreciate wanting to have a stripped-down sound (well, maybe I don't), but when you take away the instruments, the words and singing had better be pretty darn good, or what's the point of buying a CD?The singing is nice by who we need to be reminded repeatedly on the credits is Mrs. T-Bone Burnett, with Phillips-Burnett sounding like Jessica Rabbit doing her lounge act. This is a compliment. But all that's left is words, and I'm not that much of a poetry person to appreciate how these may be good or great lyrics.Sorry, but I like more music in my music."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment.","review":"I have all of Sam Phillips' albums. I've seen her live twice. She has one of the most interesting voices in popular music. However, I don't like this album. The music, for my taste, is too sparse compared to her previous works. I happen to like unabashed pop music and Sam Phillips has crafted some of the most wonderful pop music since The Beatles . I understand that artists want to grow and expand their music beyond what they've done in the past. And sometimes it really succeeds. In this case, for my ears, it didn't. I still plan to buy the next Sam Phillips album though because even though I don't care for \\"Fan Dance\\", I'm still a fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Subtle Engeries","review":"This album really grows on you. If at first you don't take to it, pull it back out again and put it on in the background while you straighten up or some such thing. You'll find yourself humming along before you realize you're doing it. Its music is subtle and mutable. The string arrangements are lovely on some tracks and Sam just has one of those voices... the songs on this album are, at first listen, fairly simple. However, when one takes time to truly listen, the complexities unfold themselves before your ears and you're whisked away into their energy. One of the best albums of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely NOT \\"Wasting My Time\\"","review":"After the first listen I thought, \\"Hmm, really good, but not quite as good as 'M & B'. After adding the CD to my listening rotation, which includes 'M & B' and 'Cruel Inventions' it's become my favorite. Interesting melodies with spare beautiful arrangements, lyrically witty and interesting. Everything I look for in great music. Lyrics like \\"I'm interesting, you think I'm interesting like the apocalypse\\" in 'Soul Eclipse' or \\"Giving meaning a resuscitation, The darkest soul illuminates\\" in 'Five Colors' are just the merest taste of the poetry therein. I could give dozens of great examples from this disk. In my opinion, \\"Fan Dance\\" is right up there with the best David Sylvian, Jane Siberry, Kate Bush, or Clive Gregson recordings (extremely high praise from me). Naturally, as with all music, your mileage may vary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phillips finds a new road with, \\"Fan Dance.\\"","review":"Sam Phillips is an artist known for her experimental albums of polished pop gems with thought provoking lyrics.Over the years her fans and critics have come to expect collections of glamourous productions with her producer husband, T. Bone Burnett at the helm. In time they learned that Phillips could always be counted on to turn in a new album every 5 years or so with a new bag of sonic tricks.On \\"Fan Dance\\", however, Phillips, chooses to lose the studio trickery of her previous efforts, breaking her songs down to their simplest form. The result is an acoustic affair that sounds more performed than produced.After stripping away the layers, what is left is a collection of personal and intimate songs that make for Phillps' most stunning and personal album to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic drama, with a little humour","review":"Movie is very good at grabbing your attention.

Even w/subtitles, its an easy movie to watch, the people are very real and convincing and good, theres an amazing scene after the white guy gets in a fight w/ his friends where he goes to watch a kickboxing match and what happens in the ring is much of a reflection of what's happening in the story, but its subtle so watch that scene again if you have the tape.

To say \\"Steal my sunshine\\" and \\"The Hard Disk Approach\\" are the only two good singles on this album is to deny yourself a pleasurable ride down a who's who and a what's what of hip hop and pop. The influences range from the guest MC's who flood this CD to Kraut rockers, Kraftwerk, who were themselves a huge influence in hip hop despite their un-urban sound and feel. Basically, this album and Len are doing what Kid Rock and the Beastie Boys have done and are doing: Polishing the image of hip hop while adding spice to the dismal view that is pop music in America today. Even though the lyrics and the melodies are basic, they are never monotonous. If you're a novice expecting the next Weezer or some other kind of pathetic rock like that, forget it.

Standard white boy \`hip hop', emphasizing parties and macho posturing. Sort of a cuter and more modern version of the Beastie Boys, but somewhat less interesting.

Which isn't necessarily a good thing. It seems like the lack of a strong thread through all the tracks left each of them a little weak. If you like \\"Steal My Sunshine\\", stick with the Go Soundtrack. A main drawback is that the album, when you eliminate the popular \\"Steal My Sunshine\\", runs a short 40 minutes.

Story line was too much for me to believe or even go there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"Clare was really too good to be true; putting up with ol' Roger that long after repeatedly catching him with his extramarital affairs? At first I was afraid that Sam was going to be a stalker, the way he kept showing up, but was relieved to learn he wasn't. I liked the way Sarah turned her life around and went after the man she wanted! Poor Maggie----hers and Bob's was such a quick fix! Lot of wasted time, huh Maggie? ha ha This was a good, quick read. Typical Robyn, but good."},{"rating":"2","title":"The good stories just keep coming","review":"Robyn Carr has recently become one of my favorite authors. This book does not disappoint. Good story line and not as predictable as you would think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard going","review":"I found this book difficult. The main characters weren't very likeable and the only thing that really stopped me from walking away were a couple of the secondary characters. I'm a big fan of Robyn Carr but this is a long way from her best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"Took awhile for me to get into it, but it really turned out good!

We simply can't say enough about them. We looked far and wide for simple, affordable, dependable flatware with ROUND spoons. Well, we finally found them and we have yet to be disappointed. They hold up extremely well to daily use, young children pounding away at them, going through the dishwasher, and are perfect for when we have guests over.And if that isn't enough for you, the beauty of these pieces transcends generational boundaries. My mother-in-law fell in love with them immediately and she remembered them two years after first seeing them and just asked to receive them as a Christmas/house warming present."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly easy to fall in love with!","review":"My husband and I spent hours deliberating over silverware patterns at Bed, Bath & Beyond, and we finally ended up choosing this one as a middle ground between his modern tastes and my traditional tastes. After using them, I'm extremely impressed with this design. It looks beautiful on the table!! But the best discovery thus far is that the round teaspoon makes a perfect egg separator! The knife design took some getting used to, but it is comfortable in the hand when cutting food on the plate. Overall, we are very happy with our new silverware! And if you don't happen to own an egg separator (I believe Tupperware sold them at some point because my mother had one for years), try out the teaspoon and see what you think! :) Buy this pattern.. you won't be disappointed. The quality is superb!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing learned","review":"I purchased this DVD in hopes of learning a few tricks to help speed up my job. I found that there wasn't very much applicable knowledge passed on. He tells you how to practice brushing and rolling and dye your spackle so you don't forget where that hole is you just fixed. There was also nothing on exterior painting like it said there was. Seems like a nice guy and a good painter, but not a teacher of his trade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird and Disappointing","review":"The contemporary scenes in the book, narrated by the Ukrainian interpreter, got me through the book. The scenes from the past were weird and self-indulgent. The book comes together as you move through it, but I'm not sure it's worth the journey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange book - why the big fuss about it?","review":"I read this book to the end because my friend really liked it. But it was rather strange for my taste. Parts of it were entertaining - especially the amusing English letters from the young Ukrainian guide. Some of the portions about the Holocaust might have had some historical truth. But so much of the book was the author's fantasy that I couldn't tell if they did."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Emperor Has No Clothes","review":"(Possible spoiler ahead) I read this book in a book club a few years ago and absolutely hated it. There is nary a truth to be found in it. Instead you get the pastiche of truth. This is a grossly immature work of fiction. If I recall correctly, toward the end there is a span of pages with barely a word aside from rows of punctuation. Perhaps this is an effort to give the reader a sense of the feeling of illumination. Instead it comes across as a painful sign of having a complete lack of ideas. Not to mention Dave Eggers did the same thing in 'A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius'. But the truth is, a good writer will give you that moment where you look up from the page, totally in awe, and you will revel in the change of your world view. This stuff here is not that stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Restaurants","review":"Please! Resaurants are to children what fire is to the Scarecrow! I found this book extremely disappointing because more than half of it focuses on dining and museums both of which most children I know would loath to enter. It listed places like Greens Restaurant (an excellent choice but not for kids) and Museum of Modern Art in San Francisco. Both of these would be sheer torture for the average 4 to 9 year old. I really can't understand how the publisher allowed this book to be released as guide for children's activities. The author takes the trouble to list such overexposed restaurants as the Hard Rock Cafe and Planet Hollywood (a guide for teenagers maybe?) and misses many of the authentic pleasures for kids in Northern California. There are a few good children's activities listed like the Hershey Chocolate Factory in Oakdale but the bulk of the book is strictly for adults. I want my money back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Its a school book","review":"I bought this book for a college class and the next semester they changed the book. I read some things on my own and found some good but I don't think it was worth the money. I still have it though because when I read it, it makes me feel smart. Plus they come out with new ones all the time...dont buy it new. Just get a used one. All they change is the cover and a couple inserts so the pages are different and you think its different than the old one. Dont be fooled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not bother with this \\"greatest hits\\" collection.","review":"This \\"greatest hits\\" collection is a major dissappointment. There are no rare cuts. The liner notes are weak. There are no insights into this band or why they got back together. This band used to be a creative and artistic jugernaut. If you don't own any Bauhaus albums pick Greatest hits volume 1 or 2. The \\"remastering\\" on this one makes very little listening difference. If you are a loyal fan save your money for a t-shirt at the concert."},{"rating":"1","title":"They try so hard to be scary, it's actually comical","review":"\\"Bela Lugosi's Dead\\" is a great tune (used to great effect in some movie from the 80's in which David Bowie played a vampire). Definitely, the highlight here. Which is a bad sign considering that was the first release from these clowns. The rest of this disc is awful; music that's supposed to frighten but ends up being laughable. Kind of reminds me of Count Floyd from SCTV when he was showing some movie that wasn't frightening at all ........\\"Oooh, this is scary kids\\"!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcomingly refreshing","review":"I had just started to lose hope that I would ever find anything different in music when a friend of mine recommended Bauhaus to me. That was two years ago, and in my opinion, Bauhaus is one of the best goth bands to have ever walked the earth. With the ever-familiar Bela Lugosi's Dead to Dark Entries and the best cover of Ziggy Stardust ever to be done, Crackle is my highest recommendation to anyone delving into the gothic genre of music. It doesn't have ALL of their best...but, it's what I started with, and it was enough to convince me.I also have to warn anyone looking for something like Marilyn Manson or any such thing...Bauhaus is not metal. They do not scream words that you can't understand, and it's not something everyone will be into. However, the dark melodies and poetic lyrics are the finest aspects of Bauhaus and any other band of it's ilk, and I for one do recommend them to anyone looking for a change of pace."},{"rating":"2","title":"I hate writing titles..","review":"If you are not already a fan of goth music, it must be admitted that this type of music can be a sort of \\"acquired taste.\\" Nonetheless, if you are interested in becoming a fan, Crackle by Bauhaus is an excellent place to start. This CD has some of the best music of these \\"Masters of Goth.\\" It includes the magnificent \\"Bela Lugosi's Dead,\\" a personal favorite of mine and many other excellent songs that will make you happy you bought this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"For all of us who waited for a Greatest Hits...","review":"Here it is. Bauhaus is one of the Goth \\"name\\" bands, one of those founding groups that you just have to know about. The problem is that unless you wanted to search through it was hard to tell the dross from the jewels. This album remedies that problem for those not \\"in the know\\". All the essentials are here (Bela Lugosi's Dead, She's In Parites, etc.). This is what a \\"greatest hits\\" should be -- a pleasure for those who already knew, an overview for those who did not. Well worth listening to if you have any interest in this style of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A concise collection of goth's godfathers.","review":"As they begin their reunion shows, Beggars Banquet has released an excellent, overview of Bauhaus. From \\"Bela Lugosi's Dead\\" to \\"Spirit\\" to \\"The Sanity Assassin,\\" this remastered compilation sums up the band's strengths nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warning: only listen to this cd in the dark","review":"After a great show at the reunion tour in September 1998, I had to get this cd so I wouldn't forget what they sounded like. I was only around 7-8 years old when Bauhaus was around, so I'm pretty much a new fan, thanks to the reunion tour. This cd's great when you're in a \\"dark\\" mood or if you're just a \\"dark-mood\\" person, it just sounds too weird listening to it with the sun shining. My personal favorites include \\"She's in Parties\\" & \\"The Passion of Lovers\\", although they left out a couple of others that I like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty disappointing","review":"I had high hopes for this purchase, but I was pretty disappointed. The contrast on the display is pitiful. Don't let that picture fool you. It's a sticker that comes on the unit prior to putting the battery in. Once the sticker is gone and the battery is installed it's contrast isn't as sharp. Putting the buttons on the back of the unit makes using this product very difficult. It has really bad usability all the way around. They spent all of their design budget on making it look cool, instead of work well. I gave up using the radio feature alltogether since the buttons are so annoying. Now its just an expensive clock..."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the Same- 2 1/2 stars","review":"This is basically the same movie as the first, except it is moved to Europe, obviously the reason being that people would have caught on that this is the same movie if it was still set in America. The worst part is that some of the jokes used in the first movie are used again in the sequel, which was funny the first time but not the second. If you liked the first movie, you will enjoy European Gigolo, and if you haven't seen this movie yet-you're not missing anything. The two movies are so similar that they don't need a third if it's anything like this. There is no way that a third movie could be any different. Yeah, the jokes were funny but to tell the same jokes again, it doesn't work. The series definitely needs to die. With all that said, it was still a decent movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Y'Know, by definition a gigalo *IS* Male","review":"I find it hard to believe there are people who are actually *disappointed* by this film, especially if they have seen the first one, or the trailer which, need I remind you feature a short man being tossed out the window and a tracheotomy hole gag. You should know what you're in for with these things people. Anyway, instead of telling you about the film I will describe the main menu, which should tell you all you need to know. Basically it's the same as the cover. When you select \\"Play Movie\\" the tower rumbles, before \\"ejecting\\" (I'm not aloud to use the appropriate word but it also begins with \\"ej\\") a flock of white pidgeons (possibly doves).

The whole movie is bad from start to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jokes are so idiotic just like the writers.","review":"Dont even watch it. THe 1st movie was so much better well at least the 1st movie didnt make fun of Asians. We all know the average asian penis is 6 inch which is the same size as whites. Since all the black guys are stealing their white girls, these asian stereotypes are made from white people so they can steal our asian girls.

I hardly even laugh at this sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"First of all I am a huge fun of Rob Schneider and i like all his movies. But this movie is terrible. It's like the director of this movie didnt had imagination at all and he copied the previous movie. But previous movie was funny and original and this one is not and really really stupid. For example, when Deuce start dating he is meeting one huge woman or he fells in love with someone who has Tourette syndrom or he is walking with a plastic leg from his gf... does it reminds you something? didnt we already saw it in Deuce Bigalow I ?You will not laugh from the same jokes twice and you will be dissaponted exactly as i am."},{"rating":"1","title":"Similar as first one but worse","review":"I actually liked the first Deuce Bigalow movie and thought this one would be good, too. Well, it was similar, but not in a good way. It's almost as if they ran out of ideas and decided to just bring in some from part one.

We started replacing the ones that we liked the most, first. Naturally. I just love Rob Schnieder, he doesn't do any movie badly.

While the first one was no masterpiece, it was at least fun and entertaining. The plot here is almost nonexistent; it eventually becomes about a plot to blow up a \\"man-whore\\" award show. The acting is bad, the jokes are stupid, and even at a running time of 83 minutes, it feels way too long. Even if you enjoyed the first one, avoid this at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the rice of admission","review":"It's supposed to be stupid, just a bunch of offensive jokes, and that is what it is.Deuce must work again for TJ to uncover the Gigalo killer in Amsterdam. Not a murder mystery, it's easy to figure out the killer, but the jokes are too good to want to. They make up all sorts of gigalo moves with names like \\"Irish Facial\\", \\"Turkish Snowcone\\" and \\"Chilean Rainbow\\" and TJ is in fine form as a slightly psycho pimp framed for the murders.Deuce once more makes his way through the freaks of Europe by being understanding to their needs rather than their desires. Yes, he finds love again, with a loopy COD hot chick.Don't bother going if you didn't like the first one, \\"The Animal\\" or \\"The Hot Chick\\"; it's in that vane.

In German with English subtitles. The only really disturbing thing was the third world elements of it and the racism to whites. It is a good movie, but a lot of people view that as a thing of the past, for me it's been the occult. The occult in Christianity is what they don't want you to know. Third world animals made to look like horses- cannibalism. They had a picture of my ancestor from the 1600s who landed in The Mayflower, he was wearing like Aguirre, he was in the military. Some slavery. Someone said that no one has ever lived in that bad of poverty before. Third world elements from an obscure cult film. I found this at my local library so it isn't that hard to find.

And kinksi is ok; he's considered some great actor mostly because he behaved like a scumbag.A poor horse is thrown off a raft, and into a jungle, maybe to die in real life. And monkeys are shown jumping off the raft and swimming away, with kinski even throwing a monkey into the water----with no director commentary about what happened to them, so it's easy to imagine the worst happened to these animals once their use as movie props were over with."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this?","review":"Expecting some grand period epic and find instead a shallow portrayal of loose historical events. The opening sequence photography is great, the rest looks like a low budget handheld with little attention paid as to the value of setting. Aguirre appears little more than a swaggering drunk with no purpose or motivation. The touted 'descent to madness' is little more than a few idle comments in the last 5 minutes of the movie as the story line never finds closure. If you want to see some good Herzog get 'Fitzcarraldo', looks like he just slap dashed this one together to get out of a loser project."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a letdown.","review":"After reading about this \\"great, classic, etc\\" movie for years, I finally laid hands on a copy and viewed it.

But steer clear of this DVD. Why? It's pan-and-scan! Unbelievable! One of the most beautifully photographed films of the last three decades, and the makers of the DVD decide to mutilate it. I was so excited finding out that Aguirre was going to be released on DVD, then crushed as the film began and I realized it had been hacked up.

A party of Spanish conquistidores blunders through the South American jungle, driven by a megalomaniac, in search of a place that does not exist.

Obviously, this is not a feel-good film and some viewers may be bored by its slow pace. However, those who stay with it will be rewarded.

Full of powerful images of impressive landscapes and natural wonders, this film as many of Herzog's films explores his favorite theme - magnificent indifference of nature against the man's obsession that borders with madness.One of the best endings ever - tragic and comical in the same time - mad and delusional man on the wrecked raft with the monkeys - and he does not see it. He lives in his own world that he created in his feverish mind.When I watch Herzog's films I think of his words, \\"If I had to climb into hell and wrestle the devil himself for one of my films, I would do it.\\" Each his film deserves to be wrestled for."},{"rating":"1","title":"acquirre","review":"This movie was not what i expected at all.

Thus, I found it boring and no one can't change that. Muahahaha... can't..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Boring. The movie allegedly mixed two prominent stories together so the movie was not necessarily historically accurate. Aguirre seemed to be consumed with his own delusions.

Classics like \\"The Thrill Is Gone\\" and \\"How Blue Can You Get,\\" fun songs like \\"Rock Me Baby\\" and \\"When Love Comes to Town,\\" and everything in between are all here. It's everything you've come to expect in BB, and then some.And the real beauty is, the thrill will never be gone. Thanks to modern technology, you can enjoy BB over and over on CD.

All in all I thought it was just a fair movie but I know it got good reviews and many people lik,ed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars for Streep, 2 stars for Kline","review":"As I watched this movie, I began to dread every appearance of Kevin Kline. While the existence of his character may have been necessary, the appearance of the character was not. If I had the time and wherewithal, I would create a Klineless version of this film. Perhaps every action of his character could have occurred off screen or be otherwise minimized. The film's editor did us no favor. To watch it again, I will have to mentally edit him out, focusing my attention on Meryl Streep. Her's is the ocean in which you will drown, in euphoria as you watch the light fade away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophie's Choice","review":"I bought this for my girlfriend who loves Meril Streep...I like her too...very talented...Kevin Kline: also very talented (\\"A friend called Wanda\\"...hilarious)...but this movie: went in the trash...absolute trash..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellence!","review":"I absolutely adore Meryl Streep. Her role as Sophie was captivating and very much entertaining. This film is filled with surprises, love, innocence, hate, betrayal, lust, forgiveness, doubt and uncertainty. All of which are the ingredients to make a great film. This may just be my favorite film starring Meryl Streep. I have so much admiration for Sophie and her choices, and Meryl did an amazing job in bringing this character to life evoking emotion from me as a viewer. Job well done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No words","review":"No words can describe the power of this film - all of the characters are magnificently played. I've never really been a fan of Kline, but he does a really good job here. Meryl Streep - well, that's all you need to say. She can't be anything but brilliant - I first fell in love with her in Out of Africa. Nothing I've seen since has lessened my opinion of her brilliance. As a mother, I can not imagine the horror of having to make the choice that Sophie was forced to make. It is a choice from which you would never recover - No small wonder that this one won the Academy Award.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Streep's Sophie will haunt you.","review":"I'm not sure whether I would call this a great film, for it fails to convey the nuances and complexities of characterization of the novel, and also, its elements of wry humor, but Meryl Streep as Sophie is simply overwhelmingly heart-rending in her portrayal of a person whose soul is destroyed as a consequence of having to live with the memory of how she was forced to cope with the Nazi genocide. I can't watch it without being profoundly shaken. Kevin Kline and Peter McNichols are excellent as well, but it is Streep as the doomed Sophie who is the heart and soul of this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the PAL version - true widescreen and not letter box","review":"This is one of these poor quality picture transfers to DVD.

I usually consider all aspects of the film (performances, script, direction, set design, lighting, millieu, mise-en-scene, etc.) before judging if it's good or bad. But with this film, Meryl Streep did it for me. Her amazing performance blew me away. It is the best performance I have ever seen so far. Other great performances by actresses: Jessica Lange in \\"Frances\\", Lili Taylor in \\"I Shot Andy Warhol\\", Meryl Streep in {\\"One True Thing\\", \\"Silkwood\\", \\"The French Lieutenant's Woman\\"}, Sally Field in \\"Norma Rae\\", Elizabeth Taylor in \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolfe?\\", Bette Davis in \\"What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?\\", and others.

While Meryl Streep was brilliant as Sophy the story simply dragged along and I lost interest. I may go back and see the edning but I highly doubt it. If there is a compelling story here, or message I did not see it. It would have been better to skip some of the unnecessary scenes and draw the viewr in from the beginning rather then slow pace it along. It may have been great for 82, but for today's fast pace audience it doesn't work very well. I had to put on Friday the 13th, afterwards in order not to feel cheated out of watching a video, now there is a film with action!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best performance by an actress, all-time","review":"Streep's performance here is awe-inspiring. Even Kevin Kline said so. He said that sometimes he forgot his lines, he was so transfixed by Streep's. No one else even comes close, especially not Katherine Hepburn (even less Audrey Hepburn). Only some of Streep's other roles rival this one. Beyond that, this film should have won not only cinematography that year, as it says above, but best picture. Gandhi was good, this is better. Kline holds his own with what is still his best performance, and even MacNichol is not completely swamped. I think he is miscast, but at a second viewing (and forgetting the book) he begins to grow on you. Speaking of the book, this is one film that is better than the book--for an other example, see Blade Runner. Styron's book has some nice passages, and is full of good ideas, but artistically it is a mess. It cries out for a super-edit, and this film does that pretty well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie Marred by HORRIBLE DVD Transfer!!!","review":"This review is only on the 1998 DVD release. This is a horrible transfer if you're going to play it on a hi-def tv. The movie is letterboxed for regular tv so it shows up surrounded by a black frame (which might not be so bad if you have a 72\\" LED TV but sucks if your screen is smaller!). Also, the colors are kinda blurry and washed out.

PT 2","review":"Well, first off, i have to say that DT is the best band ever. And watching this is just more of a display of talent than pt. 2 was. Well, if you are a hardcore DT fan, like myself, youll notice that JP does more sweep picking and more tremolo picking than ever before and i love JR and his swirling stand. So, if you are a DT fan, definately pick this one up. You will not be dissapointed. Another thing, there is no random split screen stuff like in the Metropolis DVD and the quality is much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live at Budokan-awesome","review":"Without a doubt Dream Theater is one of the most talented prog rock bands out there.

This DVD is trully a work of art! It captures the essence of musicianship at it's maximum capacity; five incredibly talented and gifted musicians playing their masterpieces!

The edgy narcissism of the male and needy dissociation of the female lead really come across."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much ado about nothing much","review":"The way Roger Ebert and TIME magazine described this movie made me buy it and see it.

Certainly, Arturo Ripstein directing is always a good omen, but... alas, it was not to be!Sure, the story is quite disturbing, but not as shocking as you'd think. Daniel Gim��nez Cacho and Regina Orozco are O.K. but not in their roles of a lifetime. The girl playing the last victim makes the best performance of them all, and Almod��var's favorite Marisa Paredes is thoroughly wasted in the most dreadful acting I've ever seen.

There were at least a dozen mislabeled figures or tables that could be misleading and the first two thirds of the book are heavy going as Transact-SQL is covered but I found the writing consistently accessible. The chapters on Data Warehouses and Data Marts were too sketchy to be of much value but the main point of the book was handily accomplished - the basics of building and managing SQL Server 7 databases. I am reading the MS Press self study guides currently and am glad I started where I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Your time is better spent elsewhere","review":"This book is simply a regurgitation of SQL Server's Books OnLine, except filled with typos. You would be better off just reading BOL if you want the \\"here are the 3 ways to do this\\" style found here. There is no input from the author on why you should do things one way instead of another, advantages or disadvantages of programming or administration options, etc. I don't suggest this book. I do suggest \\"Professional SQL Server 7.0 Programming\\" by Rob Vieira, even for beginners. There you will find some common sense advise from an experienced programmer, along with the \\"how to\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rather slowly carve open a vein with a dull spoon.","review":"The problem with this book is that about mid-way through the book, it seems to become unaccessible.

Awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Completly Amazing","review":"To be able to make heavy music with a certain amount of emotion is a very elusive quality sometimes. 40 Below Summer has hit the nail right on the head. I have seen them 4 times live and they just get better and better. My personal favorites of of this album are \\"Rope\\", \\"Wither Away\\", and \\"Step Into The Sideshow\\". They will totally blow you away.

It was diffrent for what I thought they would be like, songs like \\"Wither Away\\", \\"Power Tool\\" and \\"Drown\\" were not what I was expecting in this Album, which is good, these are some of my favorite songs. Max Illidge has a unique voice, and he does a lot with it, and the choruses are good too. This is their major label release that has some tracks of their previous albums, if you like these guys, definitely check out their other stuff.If you haven't heard of them, step into the sideshow, you'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Originality is the best","review":"Well without exaggeration, I would say this album is definately a must buy because their music is great and they have lots of talent. The best way to describe their sound is a mixture of brutal metal with beautiful melodys. 40 Bewow Summer shows this with their originality. Max's singing abilities are out of this world. His unique style stands above the whole rapmetal/nu-metal crowd. Max's great vocal talents along with the rest of the guitar players brutal riffs and the drummers perfect beats mixed together with the music. They simply cannot sound any better! It takes a lot of talent to sound original. BUY THIS CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense","review":"I'm a huge fan of 40 below summer, this album is honestly the best album i've ever listened to..

This book is a direct take on the presentation he made. He makes a very compelling case for how to grow your agency. I know it isn't what some of us want to hear. Who wants to bother with hiring other people? What the author says is that if you want to grow your agency, you must duplicate yourself by training others to perform most, if not all, duties that don't involve direct selling. And guess what? Sometimes even that function can be handled by your staff.Troy Korsgaden's one-man agency managed 1,500 policies after all of nine years in business. With his current setup - including eleven employees - has a growth rate of 750 policies a year. I know, that isn't the goal of some of us in this business. However, his message is that if you really want to grow, there are no shortcuts. Hiring staff is not optional, it is absolutely necessary. Great book. Easy to read and to the point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really A Great Booster!","review":"Power Position Your Agency is loaded with fantastic tips and ideas! It's definitely helped me, and I'm constantly going back to it. My only caveat is that it's a bit weak on the whole public relations side, especially when the rest is so useful.

I'm really confident that these two books will lead to my company's being in an excellent position!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Troy walks the talk folks - listen to him!","review":"I had the pleasure to meet Troy at one of our company's seminars. I ordered his book shortly thereafter. He has built his agency from scratch using the principles in his book to become a major player in this very competitive insurance market.

Not a lot of fluff in the book and I like that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough real substance","review":"The book has a few tidbits of valuable info. Very basic, very simplistic.

Excelllent view on how to create a successful agency."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you read Oprah, read this","review":"I definitely recommend Kathleen Rooney's book. What is especially compelling about her approach is how she mirrors the strengths and weaknesses of OBC in her own critique. Like Oprah, she dares to walk the dubious lines between the academy, mass media, and personal commentary, risking scrutiny on all fronts. And also like Oprah, she pulls it off with confidence and humor. I appreciate Rooney's struggle to be an authority and critique authority, which is why it's perfect that she includes a healthy dose of self disclosure and makes room for her own assessments of Oprah's picks. Most importantly, perhaps, Rooney makes the point that OBC is a woman-fronted effort and it's women readers who are changing the what, who, and how America reads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scratchy on one side, synthetic on the other.","review":"Sorry to say this blanket is not very nice. I love the idea but the organic cotton side is a thin scratchy flannel, not at all soft or smooth. The other side is a synthetic satin that looks a great deal cheaper quality in real life than in the photo. The color is not silky smoky green but rather a very slimy polyester lining kind of fabric in spring green. I don't get it at all. What's the point of an organic side when the extremely unorganic satin side is the only one you'd want next to your newborn's skin?"},{"rating":"1","title":"lackluster illustrations and CD","review":"The CD features one of the worst children's music recordings I've ever heard, and that's saying a lot, since there's a lot of dreck recorded for children. The pictures are engaging on the cover, but the pages are too densely illustrated and have too much of a sameness color-wise to make out the different items and cutaways. As each page is turned new vehicles are revealed, but not much seems to really change in the scene. This is not one of those books that can entrance toddlers with the illustrations, then keep them interested for years as their reading gains traction. Yet I don't think the text, which is just the song repeated, will engage a 7 year old for very long either. A disappointment (and provoked my first Amazon review)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Down by the Station","review":"This is a great book, but the Kindle edition is missing all of the pictures that support the text.

So now with this second album...I'm sure she can do better than that. It's in the genes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give It UP!","review":"This thing is just plain and simply.....awful. Believe me, if it weren't for her namesake, and she had been a \\"nobody,\\" taking this junk to any record company would have got her booted immediately. I'm sorry, but she can't carry a tune in a bucket with someone else carrying it for her. The success of this record has been due totally to media hype. I don't let anyone tell me what to like, and you shouldn't either.We thought Sheryl Crow was the most untalented person with a contract. Now, she has some steep competition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Daddy!","review":"1 good song, with \\"Pink\\" on Back up, pink was the good part. should have dubbed over Lisa. Perhaps a different career that would not lower \\"the king\\" to a jack!"},{"rating":"2","title":"true rocker","review":"I have been away from any rock albums for awhile and didn't really find any that I could enjoy. When I saw the music video of Dirty Laundry, I have to buy her album. I love all the songs. They have different feel to it as compared to other current rock albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"now what","review":"I love thise CD. she has alot of attitude without being to b*tchy,just this is who i am,take it or leave it. listen to it all the time. really like her style."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT A GREAT CD FOR A COLLECTION!!!!!","review":"I can't believe it,but Lisa Marie Presley's new album is strong,hard,passionate, and shows her true colors with every song on it!!!!!! I think with this cd it shows more of herself rather then the first one!!!!! You guys can hate her,but i truly think that she has the whole package and that is heart,strong, powerful songs!!!!! You need to pick this cd up,because you can feel the whole package too!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An under appreciated artist","review":"Lisa Marie makes another good album, that shows her maturity, strength power as a vocalist. Regardless of her heritage she is an excellent artist in her own right. The album has a bit of anger in it, but she has a right to be angry and she expresses it well. Even the trivial song \\"Idiot\\" is good. A very well produced album. Kudos to Lisa Marie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lisa Marie's \\"Now What\\"","review":"I would like to first point out a few incorrect statements I noticed in some of the amazon reviews below mine...Lisa Marie is the sole writer to ALL of the lyrics on this album, minus one track, \\"Dirty Laundry\\", and co-writer on \\"When You Go\\". Read the booklet closely, the lyric credits are separate. Linda did not write any lyrics.And \\"Raven\\" is the song dedicated to her mother, she said that on Oprah.That said, she is an amazing artist and I give her so much credit/respect for what shes doing. I've had \\"Thanx\\", \\"Idiot\\" and \\"When You Go\\" on repeat since I first heard them. The hidden track \\"Here Today, Gone Tomorrow\\" (a Ramones cover) is another of my initial favorites too.Get the album, listen to it a few times, let it grow on you........ it will."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lisa f***ing rocks!","review":"Lisa is just amazing, her voice, music.....lyrics are incredible..she really puts what she's feeling into her songs and you can feel it. All these songs are great..\\"Raven\\" is a beautiful song.and the bonus song is a re-make but i LOVE it..i highly recommend this cd to ANYONE who has the slightest liking for rock music...and especially if you like her first release, this one is just as great, if not better. \\"Idiot\\" is awesome too...great cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lisa Marie is a pretty good singer to me.","review":"I was worried about getting this album at first, but I went ahead and got it and when I got home I listened to it, but at first I didn't really get into it but later on I listened to it more, and now it's I am kinda getting into it more, but it'll take awhile for me to love it. But her album is good, if you are a pop/rock music fan or Lisa Marie fan, I recommend this album to you. :-) I give this album 4 stars because, I don't love it all the way yet, I just like it =) But I do think it's a good album, so please don't try to think I'm not saying it's not good."},{"rating":"2","title":"LISA MARIE ........... NOT ELVIS, BUT AWESOME","review":"I never, ever would have expected this CD to be as good as it is. This album is so great, really meaningful. I'll be damned if ANY aritist writes a song that as many people can realte to as Lisa Maries \\"Idiot\\". The only thing standing in Lisa's way is her name. REALLY REALLY AMAZING CD!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"CD Lisa Marie Presley","review":"Not possible to get in stores in Norway. Good service by Amazon. Lisa Marie at her best (so far) , hope she will release more albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised","review":"The look of the top is great, although the stitching is a bit restrictive in the bodice. I would have liked the stiching to have as much flexability as the fabrics themselves. Overall however, I am very pleased with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Flying Nun","review":"Honestly, this dress made me look like a Nun, or a servant from the 1800's. The part that makes it look weird is the white section of the dress, it looks exactly the same in the front as it does in the back. From the side, it just doesn't look right with this pattern. I also felt it accentuated my \\"pooch\\". I really wish this dress was designed better because it is very pretty in the front."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointed","review":"I really didn't enjoy this book. I can't really say why because it will spoil it for some people. I was just very dissapointed and felt the story could have been great."},{"rating":"1","title":"If You Care About Good Standards, Reject This Book!","review":"This book was purchased upon my daughter's request. I will be getting rid of it; and am very sorry to see that this is the kind of material being promoted for our young people. This book is about a young man who is on the swim team in highschool. He is being stalked by one of the male teachers, who eventually comes on to him. After various incidents, this teacher eventually dies. Somehow, in the author's twisted mind, the young man should feel guilty, because the young men of the school reacted negatively to this sick man's behavior. She tries to portray this situation as a homosexual being ostrasized, when it is really about a pedophile who tips his hand and gets what he deserves.This book is full of filthy language, poor grammar, and other low standards. No wonder America is going to the dogs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Realistic and fast-paced!","review":"This is the best YA book Oates has wrote so far and I hope she keeps writing them, they keep getting better and better. I finished the whole book in just a few days so it's the perfect book to give to your friends and ask them to read and you don't have to wait for a long reply. READ THIS!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of extra spaces in Kindle edition","review":"They don't really interfere with understanding, but there are lots of extra spaces in the Kindle edition. I'm halfway through the book and have reported about 15 of them. I feel like Amazon should be paying me for my work on this book rather than the other way around. It is as if they scanned it and didn't even run spell check. Shoddy.The most serious form they take (still not that serious, admittedly) is stray spaces in the middle of words. Less serious, there are lots of stray spaces before colons and semicolons.A great book though, of course. Lovely that it is available as an e-book, just a little disappointing it wasn't given a cursory once-over.Hope they act upon my reports."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learning to keep Sabbath Holy","review":"A Great read for those looking for the reason why to remember the Sabbath. This book is a classic. The body of the book shares why and how God calls us to a time of rest. Heschel's daughter's introduction shares how sacred this time was for her family growing up and the various ways they celebrated the Sabbath. I purchased the book to read a Jewish perspective on Sabbath from a beloved Jewish scholar and I was not disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Richer in value than rubies, and finer than Egyptian linen","review":"While I have been studying on the topic of the sabbath to find out its meaning for us today, I have found excellent supporting knowledge and facts that Abraham Heschel has eloquently put into words. His teaching comes naturally and his liberated style shows maturity and strength. The humour within is ticklingly enjoyable. I laughed at some of the imaginative illustrations. Although this book has fine lighter moments, it is also very serious and it does not get bogged down in the fluff of many words. Heschel has given a gift to us with this delightful book; he gently enlightens the reader to see what God has set apart for those who truly worship him in spirit and in truth. The Sabbath: its Meaning for Modern Man is worth more than one long, thoughtful and prayerful read. Thanks be to God for this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond Words","review":"I grew up Christian, and I have only recently become seriously interested in Judaism. The Sabbath was something I thought I would never understand, until I read this book. It can only be described as an experience. It is so heavy with feeling one can't help but want to experience the feelings Heschel has about the Sabbath at least once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Old Testament perspective!","review":"Really helped me understand the Old Testament view ofthe Sabbath and as a Christian helped me know my spiritualroots concerning this Day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Central to my understanding of Judaism","review":"Heschel's \\"The Sabbath\\" was perhaps the singular most important work in helping me understand my own relationship to a weekly sabbath/shabbat. It is a masterfully written (and, unlike other Heschel books, short!) description of what it means to create a \\"cathedral in time\\" each week. Heschel's central insight that Judaism is a \\"religion of time and not of space\\" -- I'm quoting from memory so don't harass me if I got it wrong -- is brilliant and important. Highly recommended for Jews and other spiritual seekers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening","review":"Loved this book! no matter what religion or denomination you are, this book will speak to you and rethink your personal sabbath."},{"rating":"1","title":"theres much better about..","review":"A very ordinary 'Poirot\\".It was one of the last and the Belgium only features in about 30 pages in the entire story which revolves around a body found in a blind women's house in suburban England - not even an exotic location for this one.Even for Christie it was a stretch to tie it up at the end. There are much better ones about than this effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"The shadow of Poirot","review":"If you expect Poirot to play a central role in this mystery, you will be disappointed. The legwork is all done by proxies, the police and everyone else fails to solve it, and Poirot at the end just sits and thinks to come up with the answer. Having said that, this mystery is not lacking in interest, and the complexity of the relationships between the characters involved is fascinating. I recommend giving it a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"M. Hercule Poirot, the armchair detective, helps our hero Colin Lamb & Detective Inspector Hardcastle make sense of 'The Clocks' murder. The story is intricate and impossible to figure out. In customary Christie style, you are kept going till literally the last pages of the book where it is all explained to you and you realize how far off you were - I LOVE IT. If you want the best detective/murder mystery or are simply looking for a challange, you cannot do better than this book (except for one Christie's other works, of course).Pssst.. Here's a hint: the book could've well been called 'The Stiletto Heel.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Trust No Clue (hehe)","review":"The first time I read this novel, I had to reread it again. Why? So many questions still linger at the end of the story even though the pages has ended. I wondered and reread and after the third reading, I finally got it all.The Clocks is a story that has two main plots, and the one has absolutely nothing to do with the other. But they were connected in a way when a young typist finds a dead body in a livingroom of a blind woman. From there it's red herring all the way. But bits of real clues emerge when Mr Lamb (a fake name) talks to a girl with a broken leg.Poirot only comes in now and then but became more interested when another murder occurs, while Lamb becomes Poirot's legs, ears and eyes. Oh yes, there are clues aplenty, but a broken high heel has never been this important as a clue.Christie delivers this story with delightful take that neither too wordy nor too lengthy. This is another often neglected classic Christie, so get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A clunker","review":"Trying to have some fun with one of mystery's typical conventions, Christie comes up with a clunker this time. Using a British spy, with the far too cute name of Colin Lamb, as the Hastings stand in; Christie has Poirot work from home in homage to John Dickson Carr's locked room mysteries. Crescent shaped neighborhoods, international espionage, a damsel in distress, and the titular clocks all come into play in this mess of a mystery that definitely needed more Poirot to make it palatable. Too many red herrings and the underlying combination of spying and romance sit uncomfortably together causing nothing more than annoyance for the reader. As it stands it doesn't so much entertain as bore and when all is resolved you are relieved as opposed to amused as you realize this one's finally over."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Clocks","review":"I had always wanted to read \\"The Clocks\\" and now that I have I am a bit disappointed. Not that the story was bad, in fact it was very well done, there is a mystery element that you will not figure out, and a few red herrings thrown in for good measure. The only problem I had was that the book depicted that this was a Pirot novel, when in fact he was hardly in it. The protagonist would present Pirot the evidence and he would basically say if they were warm or off the mark. But other than that It was a fun read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but not worth the money","review":"Now don't get me wrong, I love Linkin Park, but who pays this much for a few bonus tracks? If you want different stuff by Linkin Park, go to mp3.com, type in Hybrid theory in the search column, and go to the old Hybrid Theory site. They've got some really cool freebe songs by Mike Shinoda, Chester Bennington, the whole crew. Personal fav; Carousel."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mother of all Baby Books","review":"I enjoyed reading this book, it's so easy to read and easy to understand. I found that the book talked about things other books don't even mention. And I love that it's contents are targeted to the Canadian reader. The only flaw I find is that she doesn't have solutions to solving some first year baby situations but all in all, it was worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"100 words for a bright baby!","review":"out of the box and into her waiting hands.

The word selection was okay, but the pictures were weak. The child laughing and crying were a stretch. Some of the pictures seemed misleading. It was sloppy. The tractor picture was the worst picture of a tractor I have ever seen. The picture of book and read were similar but not distinct enough. The bathtime section, when is a toilet part of bathtime? Who has a rainbow rubber ducky?? Their rattle was the worst rattle I have ever seen. Soft toy, when in that part of a baby's vocabulary? They picked a guinea pig as one of their pets? Yes, a pet but it seemed too advanced for one of the first 100 words. Weak."},{"rating":"1","title":"small book","review":"I should have read the dimensions but this book is small had to return too small for my 2 year old prefer the larger board book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book","review":"This is amazing book, with great colors.

We got it when they were about 12 months, and at 18 months it is still a favorite that they pull from the book stack every day. It's solidly built and has stood up to twin boys grabbing and chewing on it for 6 months with no signs of wear. They love it when we ask them questions about each page -- \\"where is the ball\\", etc. They point at each picture and identify the items.

My grandsons enjoy pointing at pictures and hearing the names, and finding the picture when I say the name. Some of the pictures have confusing titles, so we just give our own.

Good practice for sitting in a lap with a storybook later on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bright and colorful","review":"I purchased this book for my grandson who is autistic, thinking the many colorful pictures would be helpful with his speech therapy. I was delighted to find that not only he liked it but his 9 month old sister liked it as well. The pictures are brightly colored and are of items of interest to babies and toddlers, food, toys, animals and lots of babies. Delightful. Well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great book.","review":"I like it because it has so many relevant pictures to help teach your child the names of things in her environment. One minus: the pages are large so it can be difficult to flip the pages while your child is sitting in your lap. But this is not enough to knock it down a notch in ratings. This is a great book for an infant or toddler."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugly book","review":"My daughter has received two versions of this book, both as gifts.

At best, this book offers a combination of basic common sense advice that the average adult probably already knows, and a large breadth of categories that may--or in may case may not--hit home. Apparently Prentis Hall published this manuscript on the merits of the author's credentials alone, rather than on it's quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"not non-stick","review":"I like the size of these pans, and for the first few times I used them they were non-stick.

Knew it would be another huge nudge in getting me out to the Great Pacific Northwest other than just for visits. I made it in 1968 and my husband and I have visited the area depicted in the book countless times. I will soon turn 70 and have enjoyed reading this book every few years throughout my life.

So this is no longer a movie of the series. However it is annoying to hear the same dialogue and gags lifted word for word from the series. Clearly the movie was made to cash in on the series without employing the same script writer to come up with new ideas.This was not the case in \\"Steptoe and son rides again\\" which I highly recommend if you liked rising damp and another comedy set in a seedy dwelling with a conniving old dad and the fall-guy son.In some ways the movie out-shone the series. Not here just do not waste your time and money.Further more the claustrophobic back-drop complete with ugly wall-paper and fittings has been replaced by a cleaner airy house which loses the atmosphere from the series.Lazy plaigarism and not even one of the same leading actors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Instruction manual for zealots","review":"To preface: I am neither liberal nor conservative, but simply believe that individuals should educate themselves, think for themselves and question everything. SUPERFICIALLY that is what this book may SEEM to be about, but after finishing, I can only see it as a frightening bit of lunatic demagoguery which tells people that emotions=truth and that \\"Wrath...is good.\\" Furthermore, Lasn seems to think that individualism and social revolution AREN'T incompatibles. So we're all supposed to be freethinkers...and think the exact same way? Liberal sheep and radical sheep are still sheep. This book reads like an instruction manual for zealots--something to make all the unemployed angry-young-men who still live with thier parents feel self-righteous. If you believe in individualistic thought, don't bother with this book...and if you should meet anyone who exhibits passionate devotion to it, I would recommend speaking in soft tones and not giving them anything sharp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Provocative and motivating!","review":"Lasn has written an eloquent diatribe against the corporate state, and his impact may ultimately rank up there with Paul Hawken's trailblazing \\"The Ecology of Commerce.\\" He points out a key fact regarding rhe evolution of the corporate state: the Supreme Court ruling over 100 years ago that gave corporations similar rights as individuals, and he rightly condemns the owners of TV stations and networks for refusing to air counter-commercials. His discussion of memes is also extremely useful. He doesn't provide much detailed analysis, however, nor a mathematical underpinning for such analysis as he does provide (no book can be all things to all people)."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Bad. Worth reading, though.","review":"Insightful? Yes. However, Lasn fails to really go in-depth into the problems of climate change, consumerism, etc. Yes, he covers an entire gamut of what will happen to us in the long run should human consumption continue at its current rate, but does so in a \\"skim-the-subjects-and-touch-on-them-briefly\\" sort of way. I'd still recommend reading it, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally! To be woken from a post-consumerist slumber!","review":"Kalle Lasn's book is clever, funny and sparklingly insightful. He is talking about the way the world can be, unmediated by the forces of marketing, and in touch with what counts. This is a handbook for revolution of the funnest kind!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didactic and dogmatic","review":"It was torcherous trying to finish this book. First, let me be clear, and say I agree 150% with the author's agenda and basic analysis. However, his choice of style demands too much from the reader. Long diatribes do little to engage the average reader that is unaware of the dominant social and political role that corporations play in our society. Instead of catch-phrases and cliches, the author would better serve the reader by dishing out a deeper analysis of the problem. Kudos to him for offering a plan of revolution, but he overestmates the future movements' powers and of his book. The rantings and raving of this author, although correct, are simply a detail in the larger problem of capitalism as practiced in America. I would avoid this book and read One World: Ready or Not for a better understanding of globalization and the cultural dominance of the corporation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these!","review":"We added this piece to the set we've had for over seven years.

His favorite Little Golden Books are: Goodnight Little Bear, The Good Humor Man, Picture Dictionary, The Fire Engine Book and Animal Orchestra. I have no doubt these books have created a love of reading, expanded his vocabulary and sped up his talking (he was 3 months premature and had a slight speech delay).

Typing more than a few words on it was always aggravating, particularly because of the space bar. Hitting it with a normal amount of pressure often didn't work, but hitting it with more pressure usually resulted in two (or more) spaces between words.I bought this keyboard because, after we moved, I couldn't find the stock, corded keyboard that came with the computer (a Dell). After a couple of weeks of pulling out my hair with the \\"Internet Pro\\", I found the original keyboard and (gratefully) went back to it.The thing wasn't completely useless, but I'd be more inclined to use it to wedge open a door than as a keyboard.

In rich nuanced prose, Horne tells the mind-boggling story of Curtis Kyles, a black man accused of murdering a white woman in racially charged New Orleans. Incredibly, Kyles goes to trial five times for this one murder because juries just can't seem to agree whether or not he is guilty. Horne puts us right into Kyles's New Orleans, mean streets filled with love and family as much as with crime and poverty. And by brilliantly weaving together details about the police investigations and trials of Curtis Kyles, Horne reveals that in the New Orleans criminal justice system that old saying is truer than ever: \\"In the halls of justice, the justice is in the halls.\\" DESIRE STREET is true crime, real life, and a book that once read will not be forgotten."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"This book is simply fabulous and anyone who has ever been to New Orleans, wanted to, or plans to has got to read it. I finished it in about 16 hours, and the last time I did that was for Da Vinci code (I know, I know, I'm not proud about it). The characters are rich and detailed, the story is riveting, and the writing is unique and refreshing.Warning: If you are looking for pulp fiction, this book isn't for you (I think the local grocery store check-out counter still maintains that monopoly). If books with too many words turn you off, turn on the tube. But if you are looking for a vibrant tale of New Orlean's secret codes of conduct, and one of the most interesting crime stories in New Orleans history, buy this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST OF THE ERNEST MOVIES, HANDS DOWN","review":"ERNEST [JIM VARNEY] IS NOW A BANK JANITOR.

When I got another grease gun, was glad to find the Lincoln holder on Amazon and ordered it. I am sorry to say that the quality of the newer grease gun holder falls far short of the older one. The wire arms tend to spread when applying pressure to close them. I have to use one hand to keep the wire arms from spreading too far apart while using the other hand to clamp it shut. This is not an easy task while using a few fingers to keep the grease gun in place until it is secure.

It's a much more believable book, certainly, and much more honest with the reader and with itself than almost anything else I've ever read.I recommend it because it breathes new life into a genre that is by and large stuck in a rut.

EH's social life in Paris is well analyzed. Gertrude Stein and Ezra Pound are part of EH's life for short periods that EH makes the most of. His life as a reporter and editor are well told too. His life as husband and father is secondary to his work as a writer. Mr. Reynold's skill as a biographer has improved since the first volume.

I'm not saying it wasn't a breeze to put together but I had to remove the four long screws from the top of the desk when I realised they should have been used for the legs.I also think the clip that holds the paper onto the whiteboard could be a little stronger. I don't know if it's just the one I have and it won't be a problem when my son is older.

Plenty of room in the back to store coloring books and blank paper and lots of room up top to hold crayons and washable markers. So we use this as a full litlte play station!He likes to stand and use the easel as well as sit and use the desk. I will say that my nephew is very big for his age. (he is about the size of an average 4year old boy) and this is a great size for him.

This book was written before his work on Zen and Eastern philosophies, and because of this, I think it's a much more helpful book for Christians. All of Watt's books are great - but this one uses concepts and examples a Christian will better understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"The sound of music dying","review":"So this is what is sounds like to hear music die? This girl doesnt have a creative bone in her body. Everything about her is manufactured. This is a girl who grew up singing Shania Twain and Dixie Chix songs!! How in the world can she think that she's a punk rocker? Punk rockers are rebels who speak their minds about social injustices going on in society. Avril is some shallow girl from canada marketed to be something she is not to the TRL teenybopper crowd. Avoid this and save yourselves. Go listen to Bob Marley, Nirvana, The Beatles. Go listen to music back when it was art.Long live The Ramones!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth your money","review":"people say that she's an individual and she's different from the rest, but someone who follows the trend of \\"hot topic\\" -esque clothes, and sings supposedly \\"punk\\" music like 8/10ths of the artists on MTV is by no means an individual of this era of music. bland, and disgustingly immature - not worth your money. please, this is just another form of mainstream music to generate money by feeding to the popular trends of the teenage generation of today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh the lies I hear.","review":"First of all, most of Avril's music is not written by her. Have you read all the credits on her CD? Maybe you should. Second she does NOT play her own music. She only knows a few cords on her guitar. That's the only reason the band is there.She's nowhere near 'Punk'. She used to be a country singer up in little Napanee. Her producers dressed her up like this to be the new 'trend'.Her music is horrible. I'll give her points for singing. She can do that, barely. Every song on this sounds the same. Why? Because they're pop songs. I'd advise you to save your money and buy something decent like AFI, Alkaline Trio, or Rancid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Avril Rocks!","review":"Besides the hit single \\"Complicated,\\" this is a talented young lady. She has a beautiful voice, which is a rarity in Rock. The songs are great instead of the usual filler on CDs. I enjoyed this effort and look forward to hearing more from her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your pennies","review":"Making music doesn't have to be so complicated I guess. Avril gets by it seems on high pitched yelling and public image alone. However, when you strip away the tough girl attitude, all you are left with is lukewarm sludge.The only redeeming track on this album is \\"I'm with you\\" in which Avril actually makes a half hearted attempt at actually singing. Certianly not worth the purchase of the entire album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do you people listen to this?","review":"You know... I don't care what you like, and i'm sure you don't care what I like. If you really do, by all means, contact me. This stated... why does music like this get made? Is it because Avril realized an easy way to make money by sucker punching kids and teens alike that can't think for themselves and get better music? Let's face it, Avril doesn't rock, and whatever you want to call her, she's anything but cool or hard or rocking.In the end, it comes down to this: Avril will eventually fade away like these other no talent acts. If you want to continue buying this album and help out her master plan to get rich fast, go right ahead. I'm not taking part.P.S.: shut the hell up about what's punk and what's not. Nobody cares to hear it."},{"rating":"1","title":"shoot me already","review":"This cd sucks.I unfortunatly,listened to this cd.I borrowed a bunch of my friend's CDs and this was one of them.It was horrible.She says she's not Britney,and she's right.Britney's better..and that's a LOT to say considering I don't like Britney's music,either.The only half way decent song is \\"Complicated\\"...and ironically it's about a person who isn't themselves...hmm sounds familiar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"She is the next big thing. Looks like a teenybopper but her voice and the way she sings is awesome. I'm way too old to be a fan in this genre. Keep up the good work, you have a whole life ahead of you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recomened for everyone","review":"Avril is a 17 year old from Canada and she's breaking out onto the music scene! I think everyone can relate to her songs and lyrics on this CD. It is well worth your money! Her first single \\"Complicated\\" was a very big hit on the charts! Avril is not afraid to be who she is and she shows that in her songs. She's multi-talented she sings, writes her own music, and plays guitar! I would recommend this to EVERYONE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Music for a new generation!!!","review":"This new Canadian sensation has the sound that people are looking for! Whatever Canada is doing up there I hope they keep it up. She is quickly climbing the charts on Billboard, the Much Music countdown, and TRL on MTV. You may have heard her song \\"Complicated\\" on the radio. If you love that the rest of the album won't dissapoint you. She is somewhere between Alanis Morisette and new songwriter, Vanessa Carlton. She fills her album tracks with songs that mean something. Some would call it angst Rock n' Roll/Punk music which is true. But I find it soothes my soul listening to her talk about her search for herself and someone who loves her. Anyone can relate to that feeling. There are also many excellent guitar riffs that keep the music moving. This is definitely something to blast from your car stereo this summer like I so often find myself doing. Whether you are younger or older this is a CD that you'll want to hang on to!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Really Good CD","review":"I really love this cd, I think that everyone should go out and buy \\"Let Go\\" Aril Lavigne's cd. It's really is a great cd, I love every song on this album, I'm not lying, it really does rock! It's totally worth spending your money on. Avril Lavigne is a really talented 17 years old musician from Napanee,Ontario, and I think everyone will be seeing alot more of her in years to come. So Everyone go and buy her Cd \\"Let Go\\" it's an awesome cd, I'm really glad that I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Avrils Debut Cd rocks","review":"the cd is great and i want to tell everyone that you should go out and buy it. the songs are great and i sing along with all them. the best songs are complicated and sk8er boi."},{"rating":"2","title":"AVRIL KICKS...!","review":"I recently just bought Avril Lavignes new cd \\" Let Go\\". I love her unique voice and style. Her song \\"Naked\\" is a song that I found I could relate to most. The song \\"Losing Grip\\" shows a more hard side of Avril, while \\"Things I'll never say\\" is a much softer side to her. I think this cd has good variety and originality,and has songs that anyone could relate to on any level. This should be a cd at the top of everyones list to buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Anything But Ordinary........just be your self","review":"In my opinion of Avril Lavigne I must say she has a great hold on people. When she sings she sings from the heart and is always her-self I must say she is a good role-model for everyone. In her first cd \\"Avril Lavigne . Let Go\\" the song Complicated has moved lots of people and made #1 on Much Music Count down... I must say Avril Lavinge good job and keep it up with the music from your heart and yes always be your self"},{"rating":"2","title":"Feel good songs","review":"I first thought that Avril Lavigne would just be another pop star, but I guess her image made me change my mind. There's something for all on this album - I'm a big Alanis Morrisette fan and some of the tracks really reflect her great voice and talent. Mine, particuarly, is I'm with you, it's a beautiful song. Don't be put off by any ther comments you recieve on this album - it's great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this album sucks","review":"There is one way to describe avril's music crappy.She is also a poser queen. No one over 11 listens to this crap anyway.This album is a discrace.Hopefully the band breaks up so we don't have to listen to anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only juvenile delinquents like this!","review":"Are you people kidding me? This crap sucks! Nothing but bratty, suburban, juvenile delinquent tunes with jangling acoustic guitars and whiney lyrics about how miserable life is. Its the most overrated album ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME","review":"What can i say this CD is amazing. At first I only listened to the songs that are on the radio and really popular. But eventually I got too lazy to switch songs and I realized THE WHOLE CD IS AWESOME!! I love some of the songs that aren't playing on the radios yet even more than Complicated and Sk8ter Boi. This is one of the first CD's that I can listen through the entire thing and not get sick of the songs! If you are considering buying it BUY IT B/C ITS AWESOME."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love her music, but.......","review":"I actually like the music, but I hate Avril herself. I suggest that you get the album because it IS fairly good :) I just don't like the whole \\"Punk\\" thing Avril is sporting... I think it seems kind of fake, no offense O_O"},{"rating":"2","title":"Connections with Avril","review":"This album is breath taking! I relate with her thoughts and emotions to the thoughts in so many ways, I didn't think it was possible. Her voice opens my ears and my soul to a whole new kind of genre of music. Her songs are meaningful and they show me what kind of person I am connecting with through song. Avril fan all the way for me!!! This girl is talented and not to mention extrememly bright when it comes to the road of life. She knows what she wants and shes out to get it! Ladies & Gents... now introducing... AVRIL LAVIGNE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keepin' it Real","review":"I'm so glad we have Avril Lavigne in the singing scene because at first I sadly thought she'd be another Alanis. I was wrong, Avril's CD \\"Let Go\\", is great because I related to it and she writes her own lyrics, she speaks the truth and if she wants to say something she says it to your face!! I love Avril Lavigne and her CD is not meant to be sitting on shelves collecting dust!! BUY IT!! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Newest Sensation","review":"Listening to her first single, \\"Complicated,\\" I knew this cd would be special. I bought it and found that it was even better than I had expected. You have to look beynd the fact that she is a contributor to the selling out of punk music, her melodies are catchy, and her lyrics are phenominal for someone as young as she. And to top is off, she's a skater chick. Avril Lavigne has shown to me that she has the potential to become tomorrow's big star. I can't wait for her sophomore album to see if she can live up to her potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"GO BUY THIS CD!!! IT ROCKS !!! : )","review":"Avril Lavigne's cd \\"LET GO\\" is so awsome from the moment I started to listen to it I couldn't stop listening till I had listened to it 10 times threw. I just resently went on a 15 hour trip and the only cd I listened to was Avril's cd that's how awsome it is!!! I think every one should get there hands on this cd she sings so well and her music is for anybody in your house hold even my 5 year old brother rocks his head out to her music!! So if you don't have the cd you should definatley go out there and get it is definatley worth every cent of your money!!! PeaceDaniellep.s. GO BUY THE CD!!! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Avril is the best punk rocker out there!!...","review":"This album rulz, because when she sings Sk8ter Boi, it's like she knows me personally. Oh and the song Complicated, cuz my life is like really complicated. But the real reason this album rocks my world is because I want to nail Avril Lavigne. Hard. Whether she is punk or not is immaterial because she is super hot, and that makes for some spicy TV. So people, lay off the poor girl, because I really want to lay on top of her. Yup, that's about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"good pick....","review":"good pick (if you're into posers). stop listening to this garbage and join the fight for heavy metal supremicy of the world.

And surprisingly, \\"Let Go\\" is filled with great tracks. Some songs are more punk and rock, like \\"Losing Grip\\" and \\"Sk8er Boi\\". Then there are songs like \\"Things I'll Never Say\\" and \\"My World\\" which are more melodic and pop. Every track is unique and different. Fans of artists like Michelle Branch, Sheryl Crow, M2M, and Natalie Imbruglia, as well as bands like The Calling will enjoy this album. Her lyrics are refreshingly honest and she has a great voice. She's young but doesn't try to be anything that she's not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Ahh, how I love the ignorance of these pop lovers. (note: Avril is not punk, but pop). I especially like the spotlight review where it says she writes her own music and plays her instrument. HELLO! She has a team of writers that helped her (just look in the liner notes) and she can't play guitar for crap. Also in the liner notes, there are no less than five(?) people given credit for guitar work. Why do you think she plays with a full band and doesn't play guitar herself?? Proof: in the video for complicated she is pictured playing a single chord; G. That chord isn't even in the song!This C.D.=crap. don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let go","review":"The cd itself was fine and the order was correct but the cd cases were all broken. This was really disappointing and I wish I would have been able to send them back for good condition cases"},{"rating":"1","title":"I know many people will not find my review helpful, but...","review":"I'm not a person that hates trendy music. I'm not against Hot Topic. I think people should be able to listen to the music that people want to listen to, shop wherever the want to, etc.Behind the 'punk rock image' Avril plays music that you've heard before. She deals with the same lyrical topics as many pop icons that you hear on MTV. Avril isn't really groundbreaking. Sorry to break the hearts of some.However, I will give Avril credit for writing her own material at a young age. She mixes her influences up, but as I said earlier, it's been done before, and it's been done better."},{"rating":"1","title":"very very annoying","review":"avril has the worst voice ive ever heard it sounds like britney spears with hiccups and her songs like sk8er boy are just too queer for anybody cool to dig maybe chiks like this but if youre a dude stay far away from this pile of crap avril is cute and id do her but that doesnt mean she has talent as a musician if this is talent i guess the song balls to the wall is a deep and complex recording"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply horrible","review":"The only reason I'm reviewing this is because my cousin's a big fan of Avirl Lavinge.DO NOT I repeat DO NOT buy this!

Otherwise, I know that many of the folks who previously reviewed this album would have loved to hit a 1 rather than a 4 or 5. But alas, in keeping with tradition of the mass, they believe that they are obliged to follow the pack and, consequently, think alike as well...or else.I am not particularly fond of this cliched album or the cliched Avril because listening to her dull and ORDINARY music (or cacophony, if you like) is sincerely a waste of one's precious ear drums -- sorry Avril, I know that this is way out of your domain, being ordinary and what not, but truth's a filthy she-dog, ain't it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do I like this THING?!","review":"I listen to THIS all the time. But I can't figure out why. Shes not punkish at all, just \\"herself\\" could be manufactured though. Her music though interesting is pop anyone that puts this in the same catagory as the Ramones (punk) is sick. I don't even really listen to the songs, though Nobodys Fool is funny because shes doing this \\"rap\\" thing and fails badly. I am (suprisingly) a fan, but still can't figure out why.Can't fully endorse this because its not great. Make sure you know you REALLY REALLY want this thing before you buy it.Why stars, its ok (3 stars but loses one because I can't figure out why I like her or this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"This sucks","review":"This album sucks!! How can anyone like this crap? Avril sucks at singing and can't even play a guitar!!!!

Sometimes you just need music that's fun to listen to, that you can blast in your car with your girlfriends, on the way to the beach or going out! It's fun to sing along to and who said good music has to be deep music! I think Avril Lavigne knows how to write a fun song that people want to listen to. If you need an album that's just fun to put on and play through, then this is perfect!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ha Ha","review":"This is hilarious. How dare this chick from Canada parade around thinking she is Johnny Thunders or Sid Vicious. She thinks she is so punk, strutting around with her dumb guitar and singing dumb lyrics with awful titles like the unbearably cheesy Sk8ter Boi. Talk about dumb. But there are moments on the CD when she wnders into the territory of being not-bad-enough-to-make-you-puke. But it still is almost hilarious that this pompous little girl wanders around thinking she is SO punk. It ain't gonna happen. Go back to where ya belong, little idiot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not punk","review":"Avril has some classic songs, but is nowhere near \\"punk\\".Avril's music is definetely pop.

You will be amazed by how good the rest of the songs are. She could release any of the songs on this album and have it be an instant smash. The types of songs she peforms range from pop-oriented tracks to true rock tracks. But throught the whole album all of the songs are held together by her definitive attitude. Anyone can relate to the songs on this album. Avril is the \\"it\\" girl right now and \\"Let Go\\" is the reason why."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's just.. Avril","review":"My expectations for this CD were higher than the product I actually got. I was hoping for more punk hits like Sk8r Boi.. but no.. they were all softies. Don't get me wrong, I love the CD, but I was hoping that she wouldn't totally sell herself out and make songs that people want to hear every 2 seconds on the radio. I guess for a debut album songs have to be like that. So for the next album, I'm hoping for hardcore punk.For everyone who says she's just like Britney.. she's not. Sure, she may keep her hair and makeup under check, but she's not all about showing off her bod and proving to the world how not-innocent she is. She's just.. Avril. And for that.. she rocks my world!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rare Album Thats a 10 From Top to Bottom","review":"You know the young stars of today and how they get started. They come from little shows (Britney, Christina, Jessica Simpson) or win contests like the American Idol winners. Well this is one girl who didn't have a push from anywhere and didn't need it. She came out of nowhere and put out an album that was simply put A 10 from beginning to end. The music is new, it's fresh, it's original and it varies from song to song. Avril Lavigne's style is exactly what I like, emotional, showing true feelings, and tells alot about her personality and her life. It's not simply party music that doesn't mean anything, She doesn't follow the trend of today in which everything is about sex. She wants to be known for her tallent not her sexuality and for that I admire and respect her. To all the haters out there maybe you should think about that fact and actually listen to her music before being judgemental. Avril, I wish there were more girls like you."},{"rating":"1","title":"If there was ever an album worthy of ZERO stars, this is it","review":"Avril Lavigne is a shrill, pointless little girl trying to act like she's musically gifted. Sadly, she is not original to any degree. Her songs are cliche and her false presentation of herself as the anti-Britney is disgusting. Perhaps I'm the only person who saw her hanging out with Nikki Hilton and Nicole Richie on \\"Celebrities Uncensored.\\" For someone who likes to act like she is above the industry, she sure does succumb to it rather easily. The saddest fact is that Avril has convinced herself that she is an \\"artist,\\" but she's a sham through and through. Just [try to] listen to the agonizing \\"Sk8ter Boi\\" and it will become instantly clear that this is one of those CDs that one is embarrassed to have purchased later in life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very GOOD","review":"Surprise to me as I listened to critique my teenagers music.

From what my kids have seen of her so far, Avril makes a better role model than most other teen singers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alanis in training...","review":"If you liked Alanis' breakthrough album, you will love Avril. Even in the credits Avril thanks her ex- \\"bois\\" for giving her the inspiration to write these songs. Most of the songs are up beat, even if the lyrics aren't so up beat, and it is hard not to listen to every last song through. A particular favorite, \\"sk8ter boi\\" (original and cute title) has a cool story line to it, and although it is young (I said young, not immature) it quickly grows on you. Avril gives off a tough, edgy, independent air and any girl no matter how old cant help but admire her. It is definitly worth a listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"All together on the count of 3: 1.... 2....3.....","review":"THIS IS NOT PUNK MUSIC! That being said, I don't mind her music. I actually liked \\"Complicated\\" the first 500,000 times I heard it. Let's face it though, the music industry is totally fabricating her \\"punk\\" image in order make her more appealing to the pop music population. Teeny-boppers all over are pleading, \\"But she's punk!\\". Is she? What is punk about her music? The fact that she sings about a \\"Sk8er Boi\\"? It's absolutely ridiculous. Can she play that guitar? I'd love to go and see her live to confirm that. Her music isn't the worst (although some of her songs really are pathetic), but any artist who is destined to disappear 1 year after their debut album (and we all know she will) hardly deserves 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS SUCKS","review":"i'm so mad that i couldnt rate this album zero stars...DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM IT SUCKS!

Now, I don't like to sound like someone's mom, but it sounds like Avril is just yelling her lungs out, while her band plays background music. It's absolutely atrocious. Aside from that, Avril doesn't even sound like she does on her cd. In real life, she sounds worse! If you watch the Video Music Awards 2002, she is performing and you can't hear her above her band very well. In addition to that, she sounds like she's dying or something. She is the worst person who has tried to sing since the Stone Age! Aside from most of the cd, the only good songs are her 3 singles, and that's why she released them; because they're the only good songs on her album."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best cd ever!!!","review":"this cd is soooooo good. i just love the songs SKATER BOY, and COMPLICATED.

It was that combined with the radio version of Complicated that got me to buy this album, and God do I wish I had bought the single. Her friends on the instruments are basically terrible. The songs themselves make it well known that Avril idealizes Alanis (and I actually like Alanis quite a bit) since she constantly tries to sing in Alanis's style. The band and the style are a big mistake, hunny. Get some good musicians and sing your own way cause your voice is awesome. as far as the lyrics go, are you all fourteen? I can't believe how so many of you who reviewed this album said you could identify with her songs. I'll admit I like Complicated, but even with that song, only the radio remix (which improves on the instrumental ten fold) is worth listening to. When she looses the band and grows up a little she'll be awesome, but this album sucks. If you want to hear Complicated buy the single cause this album will only disappoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"obviously this cd is junk, nobodys review it since may 2002,well the guy who reviewd it in 2002 was a smart person.she is way to young to be writing music.a.) she's got nothing to write about accept all the crapy boy friends she's had,and b.) she's just not good at it......."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT PUNK","review":"you people are fools. you can like avril and be a big fan, that doesnt bother me.

Seems she's too consumed with her 'hardcore punk' image and slagging off other artists to sincerely care about her music (which is mostly produced by her 'writing team'). Songs like 'Sk8er Boi', which she discribes as \\"Deep and emotional\\" - I'd be more inclined to classify as short-lived juvenile rubbish. Any song I've heard of her's has sounded so formulaic and dull - and she seems to lack the intellect to back up the opinions she's trying to express publicly. I mean, she can't be too smart if she thinks a badly-written song about a teenage infatuation is 'deep' and slagging off another highly renowned (and actually talented) artist is easily dismissible."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't even believe this thing exists","review":"I'm not even sure what to say, Growing up in the punk era and being around punks and skaters almost all of my life I look at her and I just can't believe that she would claim such things, I would love to see her actually try to hang with punks and skaters then watch them beat her ***, She couldn't survive in the punk culture if she had security around her 24/7.I'm just more shocked that she makes these statements and doesn't expect any comments on them from the people who have to look at her with disgust.Avril, I think that you were better off Bible thumpin with your country music, You need to go back to your hole and leave real punk music to real punks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disregard the 1 star, I give this CD ***NONE***","review":"I can best sum up this \\"artist\\" in two words: RIDICULOUSLY OBNOXIOUS. I thought that no one could top the Backstreet Boys and the rest of the boyband garbage in being the MOST ANNOYING music. Frankly, I would rather listen to extremely annoying children's music for hours and hours instead of listening to one of these songs. Save your money and your sanity, don't buy this poor excuse for music!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"i think i am going to be sick","review":"WHere do i begin, let us start with the fact that this girl is giving gals like me a bad name. i walk around and i see all these little 12 years olds dressed in a tie and plaid pants claiming that they are punk. what the hell do they know.Punk is not about what clothes you wear and how hardcore you are, its about the music and the state of mind. you don't see them talking about the ramones and sham 69. instead its about Good cahrlotte and this wannebe. i am utterly sick of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"In One Word: Amazing","review":"The album Let's Go, by new comer Avril Lavigne is one of the best new albums to be let out this summer. Her single complicated isnt not even an example of how good her album is. The song \\"Tomorrow\\" and \\"I'm with You\\" are examples of how much of a talented writer this 17 year old is. The songs speak to the listener.. \\"Sk8er Boi\\" and \\"My World\\" are the funky songs that also hold some meaning. This album is wonderful.. Its one of those albums that teenagers can look to and listen to and know that there is someone other then them out there that has the same problems as they do.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Avril Lavigne","review":"Every once and a while an artist of this caliber comes along and blows the competition away. I think this has to be said about avril lavigne. At the age of seventeen she shows more promise than some of the more popular act such as britney spears and christina aguilera. this album picks you up and takes you into her mind. It blows your mind to think that a seventeen year old can write with so much passion and play that good. Her voice is top notch and her writing ability is amazing. i highly recommend this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Complicated","review":"Avril Lavigen showed the world that freshman albums rock and so do skater boys, punk and ties. Her first single track two on Let Go \\"Complicated\\" was anything but. With strong lyrics and a perfict message for todays teens sufering from identiy crisis she did amazing. The lyric's \\"Your not fooling any one when you become some body else round everyone else\\" deffinitly shows that Avril is going to go far with her music and stick around. Other songs on her cd that really make an impact are tracks one (Loosing Grip with the lyrics \\"You werent there when I was scared\\") and track 12 which talks about a boy being lame because he chose weed over her. All of her songs either have an awesome message or there just plain fun like Skater Boy. Avril is going to be a roll model for all girls to look up to. I think everyone should get her cd because shes on fire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I thought that Avril's CD is great. I like that it's a little bit of pop and a little bit of rock too. She has a great voice. I like most of the songs on the cd. Complicated and Losing Grip were probably my favorites. I like that she sings songs that you can actually relate to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Talent","review":"What separates her from the Spears, the Carltons, and the Pinks is simply raw talent. Not since Alanis Morissette (another Canandian rocker chck) have we seen unadulterated girl-angst. The maturity of her lyrics is beyond her years, yet they remain accessible. I must admit, however, that it took a few weeks to warm up to \\"complicated\\" (probably the albums most radio-friendly cut). but nonetheless, \\"let go\\" offers a plethora of future top 40 hits. ie \\"losing grip\\" \\" sk8ter boi\\" \\"Im with u\\" and \\"unwanted\\" My heart holds me from giving it a 5star since she still have a lot of growing up to do. THe music occassionally steps into repetitive territory, yet it's refreshing that she was given a chance to have so much input in a project such as this. Every1 take notice, Miss Lavigne is here to stay. Easily the most promising young artist to come in years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music You Never Want To Stop Listening To","review":"Well, as I write this review I have the Avril Lavinge CD popped into my computer and listening to it. It is one of the few CDs people find that they can listen to straight through thirty times without screaming \\"Shut that freakin' pop princess up!\\" Clearly different from that of Britney Spears, she's a Sk8er punk rather then the \\"Hit Me Baby One More Time\\" school girl.. particually with the line \\"Take Off All Your Preppy Clothes\\" (Complicated). I often find people (including my parents **shutters**) singing the lyrics to Sk8er Boi, or the MTV hit, Complicated. I highly suggest this CD to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"She is a new singer and she knows how to sing!","review":"Avril Lavigne is good at her music and I don't know how she does it. My favorate song on this album is Unwanted because it has alot of ROCK! She is only 18 years old and she is allowed to sing and she is very great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wooahh there - calm down.","review":"Reading the reviews of this album and you'd think it was rubbish - but it's not. I think what has happened is that a young talented artist who hasn't quite found her niche has adopted this persona of a sk8er (yeah ok that bit sucks) as it was probably the closest image to her 'sound' - this has nothing to do with her ability to write a song, play an instrument, or perform as an artist - so lets leave the fashion criticism to Vogue.I won't pretend that all the songs are fantastic, but if you relax, and enjoy the album for what it is - commercial teenage soft rock, you might find out you are in for a treat!As far as the lyrics go - it's basic stuff - but it gets the point of the story over, and as in Sk8er Boi turns out to be quite an enjoyable 3 minute-odd.Put simply - you like Sum41? you like Complicated by Avril? you'll love the album .... no real diversion from track to track, but enjoyable nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music is dead","review":"Once I heard what some \\"critics\\" consider good music, I felt ashamed of the music industry. The image she presents in contrast to her music don't fit. She looks like she is going through a childhood phase and her music sounds like it is too. Originality in mainstream music has died and I'm severely disappointed when I hear of someone that proclaims that they are original like Avril Lavigne. It's ridiculously typical and just by a change of instruments, it can be borderline country music but not just any country music, typical country music. This is not music. This is no better than bubble gum teen pop. In fact, it has sunk to a deeper level. This is selling out people and there is no complexity to the music and to the riffs or scales I've heard. I've heard all this crap before. Obviously she can sing. But she is way too easily amused if this is what she \\"honestly\\" believes is music."},{"rating":"1","title":"overhyped, formulaic tripe","review":"she gets a bonus star for some pretty nice extra multimedia content included on the CD. but the music is remarkably ordinary and bland - if you've heard Complicated and Sk8er, you've heard everything on the album. every song is slow start, then a fast, pseudo-exciting tempo switch coupled with some screaming by avril, then devolves into a repetitive, bland chorus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good.","review":"This is a pretty good CD. Some of the songs are good (they're mostly just radio hits), and the rest is filler. But the songs have good lyrics, and she does play a mean guitar. Overall, Avril does a good job for a debut album, and she is one of my favorite female artists."},{"rating":"2","title":"It makes you feel good about yourself!","review":"This is a great CD, go to your room turn it full blast lie on your Bed for half an hour, you'll feel alot better, i'm 14 and this is great music, my mates love it, its a CD that, in a way tells you a bit about and describes it and still sounds good!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome album, not just another pop princess!","review":"I bought this Cd thinking that AL was just another pop princess singer just trying to make some money. Well turns out, she's a pop punk princess trying to make some money. This is a great album, I must say. I recommend it to all fans of Alanis Morissette (except that Avril doesn't have a whiney groany voice like AM). This is for all fans of groups like blink-182 who like hearing a girl sing for once. Check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"Great Cd, I listen to it over and over! Great tunes and ltrics. I would suggust this yo ANYONE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems with the hype of Avril","review":"Okay, honestly this album is not as bad as I thought it would be. However, the entire \\"punk\\" persona Avril claims to devote her music to is far from center. I'm not a fan of hardcore punk music but I have heard it and 'Let Go' is not that. Obviously this is female pop-rock, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with it in general, but when you want the public to percieve you as an alternative, rebellious, non comformist who despises top pop acts of the day..and then put out an album which has mainstream pop written all over it..you're just beggin to be criticized. Fellow female artists you could compare such as Michelle Branch, Vanessa Carlton, and Alanis Morisette do not present a false image musically or literally. Avril Lavinge will most likely become a success due to the part of mass media hype and industry appraisal...there's no denying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"in my opinion, a pop/rock masterpiece","review":"LET GO is an incredible piece of rock music from one of the best new voices I've heard. For a long time I've privately lambasted modern acts for not having anything new to say or a new way to say it. Avril Lavigne's album is a bright silver lining on an ever darkening cloud. Avril's voice is the most striking feature of the entire album. From hard rock, acoustic pop and balladry, she can sing it all and hits each note full and strong. Her versatile singing is shown to best effect on my favorite song of hers, \\"I'm With You.\\" Her melodies are creative and all catchy, even on the darker sounding songs. This is an album which will not sound horribly dated in years to come. The production is clear and vibrant. Avril is a musician to watch. I'm eager to hear her second album."},{"rating":"1","title":"copy cat","review":"she stole all her riffs from c-murder (listen to \\"life or death\\" and hear for yourself. this was after she was sleeping around with 2-pac's crew pretending to be a fan when all she wanted to do was steal their beats. funny thing is, she's more ghetto than x-raided, biggie, c-murder, 2-pac, and slicey dice all rolled into one--which is what i hear she actually did one crazy stoned night. that's why i'm giving it such high marks. cuz she's really scary, and that's what ripoff rap is all about. this is the kind of album makes kids beat their parents up and go on a killing spree."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best","review":"This is like one of the best CD I bought!! Its awesome! It isn't really, really good, but it made me listen to it at least two songs a day, I got addicted to it. You will only like this Cd if you like Avril Lavigne, and she friggin rocks!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cd!!","review":"Avril Lavigne just lets go in this cd. She speaks her mind. If you thought her debut single \\"complicated was good then you would love her other songs. Anyone with an open mind and good taste in music would love \\"let go\\". I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Punk nah not really...","review":"They have been calling this Punk but no way jose, this is nowhere near it, it's not grunge it's not even rock. Avril is just a new teen girl making teen pop and to selling her music it was easier to pretend beeing a punk then the ordinary teen-pop britney look a like.The cd is bad, i mean it's rehehellly bad. \\"Complicated\\" is a decent pop song, i think it was quite catchy, but spare me from the rest. \\"Skater Boy\\" for example is a real pain, and it proves how much punk music she's into. Liked \\"Comlicated\\" then get the single,..."},{"rating":"1","title":"POSER, BUT TALENTED","review":"toooooo bad that avril is a lil wanna be rocker. if she wasn't this cd would have been better, and maybe i would give her credit. i believe that yes, she can write, and yea she can sing ...and she plays that guitar. i heard on VH1 that she can't even skateboard. every rocker knows how to skateboard. hello POSER 101!! honestly there are only a few good songs ont he cd. they are:1) losing grip2) i'm with you3) unwanted4) things i'd never saythats all. like seriously i got tired of this cd after i heard it for the first time. avril sorry but NOOOO!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For the critics...","review":"This is one of the best albums I have recently acquired. My favourite tracks include Losing Grip, I'm With You and Things I'll Never Say. Ok, so she may not be as completely punk as she would like to think but each song on the album has a strong chorus and a catchy tune that will leave you wanting to listen to it again. I think people who are slating this album haven't given it enough of a chance, no one said she had to be hardcore punk. In my opinion she rocks and i advise anyone thinking about getting this to hurry up and do just that! Ignore the critics, she rocks! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's great, but not a classic","review":"I got this CD on a fluke. I like to go out on a limb to find new music and was impressed by what this teenager had to say. It is great rock music with meaning you'll never get from Britney or Christina. However, there is plenty of room for improvement, and provide she isn't a one hit wonder, I am sure we will see it.The only thing I find a bit disturbing is the lyrics. While I appreciate the depth of them, the subject matter seems a bit much to be coming from someone still in high school..."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best CD I have honestly ever loved!!","review":"Avril Lavigne's song \\"Complicated\\" is the best song I have ever heard in my life.

It's not rock - it's not new age - it's something you have to hear.I rate this one at the top and can't wait for her next album. I remember when YES first came out with the album Fragile. They didn't fit in just one category either. I played that one until it was worn out and then replaced it - this one is that good.Melodious - climbing rock beats - songs that flow too. She won't be an unknown for long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh...","review":"i will give avril this, she has a very good voice, but come on. i hate how this is marketed as 'punk'. if this is punk, then someone kill me. now. avril was originally supposed to be a country artist, but the record companies realized they could make more money with punk, that should tell you something. and she doesn't even listen to good punk. blink 182 and boxcar racer are not what i consider punk. all you out there, do yourselves a favor and check out dead kennedys, nirvana, the clash, and the misfits."},{"rating":"1","title":"CAN SOMEONE SHUT THIS B**** UP","review":"I HATE EVER SONG THIS SL*T SONGS.

No one at my school likes her. I find Michelle Branch to be much more talented, yet she is under similar artists.You know, I wrote a review on the same product, and I think this CD is boring and bland. A boring acoustic guitar, bland lyrics, horrid singing.If Avril would just drop the \\"i'm a bad sk8er grrl and totally punk\\" act, I think I would like her a little more.Why I gave it two stars is because The songs are okay, but they just have no depth to them. They are just boring and about the same topic. Nuff said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avril sucks","review":"All I have to say is that Avril sucks. She'a a terrible singer and this cd is crap.

I don't recommend this album to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"supposedly 0 star for a non star!","review":"What a lyric! \\"She was a girl, He was a boy\\" whichever comes first I don't care. No sense at all! Avril is a poser! she can't sing and this girl wears hideous clothes! \\"Sk8r Boi or Boy\\" whatever! is a song for non-intelligent people. The lyrics to most of her songs especially the cuts made for singles can make people dumb by just listening to it. Simple. Don't buy the record as it totally has no substance at all following the very first track!"},{"rating":"1","title":"all posing aside","review":"Avril Lavigne may be a poser but she has reached something in American teenagers. I bought this album when I was a poor, misguided radio addicted baby and I loved it. Avril has mastered the G chord and the contrived lyric.

If you are a fan of pop music, buy this CD, I'm sure you'll love it but if you like good music avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mi r3vu","review":"Do you like collections of virtually identical, completely fabricated songs about poseurs and 'being yourself?' Well, then if you can wade through the terrible, grating lyrics, the shrill voice and a modicum of flawed melodies, you can treat yourself to this overplayed mass-media catering pap. With the impressive lyrical flair of constant 'na na na nas' and 'yea-ee-aahs,' you'll never get tired of the mind-numbing repetition!

Avril Lavigne's new cd 'Let Go' is positively one of the best cd's I have ever bought. If it were a tape, I would've worn it out already, cuz I swear I play the cd about 15 times a day beginning to end. Every single song has a great message and makes you wanna get up and sing. It's a great cd, and the fact that Avril is just 17 (like myself) is even more amazing. Do I sound obsessed? That's cuz I am! Avril has loads of talent and I hope that everyone else gives her a chance as well. If you don't have the cd, go out and buy it, it won't be a waste of your money.~Avril's #1 fan: Holly~"},{"rating":"2","title":"All Out Awsome","review":"Avril has an amazing voice but that's not all of it. She sings with energy and actully puts effort into her music. She's fun and creative and her songs make sense. Avril has a thing with punk making chick rock much better. That's more than i can say for some singers. I got her CD the first day it came out and I haven' taken it out of my CD player yet. She uses really easy cords so for those of you who play guitar(like me), you can play along."},{"rating":"2","title":"...","review":"I am a sixteen-year-old girl, who actually has fairly good music taste, considering what has been put out there in recent years...and a pretty eclectic music taste. Im not saying my taste is perfect (far from!) but I do like a wide variety. While I'm not partial to Avril's attitude or the whole \\"im punk\\" thing, I hate the word \\"poser.\\" I believe everyone should dress and act however they want to act, and it shouldn't be categorized and labelled. Anyways, my point is that even if you aren't too crazy about the person, you can still like the music, and that is how I am. my friends and I listenned to this album repeatedly over the summer of 02. the music is catchy, I can relate to many of the songs, and her voice is appealing. I dont hate Avril, but I dont love her. I do love the cd though (and know all the words, heh), and I look forward to hearing her next album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fefe Dobson is like Avril Lavigne","review":"AVril Lavigne has a unique sound and it's impressive to see someone so young have such success. In future albums I'd like to see her sound develop into something more fuller. She reminds me of Fefe Dobson. I'm responding to her song Take Me Away like I first did with Avril Lavigne.

Tell me what you think.:Lisa"},{"rating":"1","title":"Many People Have Different Opinions ...","review":"I have read reviews on this CD here, and also heard some opinions from people in real life. I have to agree that I do not like Avril Lavigne, she is a poser, and she cant sing live. But some people have to like her to have sold so many CD'S. Right? Or maybe people just buy her CD and realize its garbage I don't know. I guess I wouldn't buy this CD some songs are catchy like \\"Complicated\\" (possibly the best song on the CD) which made me want this CD a little while back but luckily my friend got it and we listened to it, I was disgusted. Some songs were brilliant others were bad. Miss Avril Lavigne is NOT going to go far in the music world - she has hardly any talent, shes a poser (possibly more fake then Britney Spears) and she should lend her songs to someone who CAN sing.Overall: The CD'S not too bad. The songs are OK. But Avril spoils it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another No-Talent Fraud","review":"Several reviewers have already pointed this out, but it bears repeating: Avril has no talent. If you hear her perform live, what you get is a lot of out-of-tune shrieking. If you watch her guitar-work on stage, you will see that she's faking it: she isn't even playing the right chords. If you check out the credits, you will find that she only wrote some of the lyrics. The music was written by someone else.Some of the tunes are catchy and they make good party music. But why didn't the recording company get someone who can actually sing, play, or compose? It's sad, really, because there are so many talented singers, players, and composers out there who will never get a break."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another album deserving nothing more than 0 stars!","review":"Since this is NOT real music, it doesn't deserve to be rated on the same level as real music.

I don't get it. She doesn't really write her own songs (check the album credits: there's always two or three other names next to each song). She can't sing or play an instrument (check out her live performances and see for yourself). And she's not particularly good-looking. So what's the deal? Is her Dad a music-industry producer or something?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Punk or poser? Maybe neither...","review":"I wouldn't say that Avril Lavigne has a ver punk-ish style, but I also wouldn't say she is a poser. Who invents the definition for poser, anyway? Although she does not write her own music, I have to defend her at the point where some people say she can't even play the guitar! this is totally untrue, she CAN play the guitar (in fact she taught herself)and although her voice isn't very trained, it definitly fits the type of pop rock music she sings. The CD Let Go is a great buy for people like me, and others who can relate to the songs. *My fav songs are Anything but Ordinary and Things I'll never Say* So stop calling her a poser and a bad singer because, well, should we compare her voice to that of a rapper?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully Avril","review":"Not pop Not punk Avril Lavigne is in a group all of her own in which she created and no one else can ever be apart of this young taltented artist is a simplely stupindous writer and a steller singer i have 2 copys of her cd and take it every where i go she is simple her self in a world of artisist who conform to consumer driven ideals she is an origanial and will stay this way i see her around for a very long time"},{"rating":"2","title":"It will suprise you...","review":"This CD was a lot better then I thought it would be. I was a little skeptical to buy it because I had only heard 3 of the songs and 30 second clips of the other 10. So I decided to buy it anyway. I like it a lot. This is finally a CD that I can listen to all the songs without skipping one song. She's not pop as other people say. She's rock/pop. I think personally she's more on the rock side because she plays her own guitar and writes her own songs and sings them too herself. Unlike other pop artists I know of. All the songs are different so that's also a good thing. So if you don't care what other people think and are looking for some great music to listen try Avril Lavigne she may be just what you're looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definately More To Come From Avril","review":"Avril Lavigne is and has been my favorite music artist for about a month. She has a free spirit and writes with passion, and not about the same [stuff] we've all heard before. I really look up to her because she 1)writes her own songs 2)plays guitar 3)stays true to herself and isn't a wannabe. I also love her style in clothes!I origonally picked this CD up because I heard \\"Complicated\\" onthe radio and INSTANTLY fell in love with it! I went to the local music store and found it was [reasonably priced]because she's a new artist. I bought it and when I first listened to it I only listed to \\"Complicated\\", but within 2 or 3 hours, I learned the lyrics to every song by heart!So, if anyone out there is torn between buying this CD or not, I say go for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It is not Complicated to figure out that Avril Rocks!","review":"I know Pop is kind of going out, But I love female pop stars.

She writes really good songs, and writes about what she feels and dose't care what other people think.Loosing Grip- Great opener song. 5/5Complicated- The song that hot her started. 5/5Sk8er Boi- Great story song. People could really relate to this song. 5/5I'm With You- Great slow song. 5/5Mobile- Another great song. 5/5Unwanted- A powerful song about being unwanted. 5/5Tomorrow- Great song. This is one of her best ballads. 5/5Anything But Ordinary- Great song. She really can sing. 5/5Thing's I'll Never Say- Sounds like a popish song. 5/5My World- Excellent song about her life. 5/5Nobody's Fool- Gives a great message to be yourself. 5/5Too Much To Ask For- Avril shows off her wrtiing skills. 5/5Naked- Great song. 5/5I think this is a great album. Can't wait to see what Avril has in store for us when her new album comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"4 1/2 stars?","review":"Give me a break.

One of the most overrated albums in years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complication at it's finest.","review":"I bought this CD a long while back before I was exposed to the real sickness that seems to be seeping through MTV that is Avril Lavigne. And even when I DID like her, I was not at all impressed with the CD. This CD's high points are \\"Losing Grip\\" and \\"Unwanted\\". Anything else on this CD is just not worth having your ears bleed. I mean come on, what 18 year old girl writes something as childish as \\"Sk8er Boi\\", or something so inane as to \\"I'm not the milk and Cheerios in your spoon, It's not a simple here we go not so soon, I might have fallen for that when I was 14 and a little more green\\" I'm sorry, but what was that? Oh, and this: \\"I never spend less than an hour, washin' my hair in the shower. It always takes five hours to make it straight. So I'll braid it in a zillion braids, though it may take a friggin' day. There's nothin' else better to do anyway\\" This CD made me want to lick my eyes. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Avril","review":"This is a good album and I realize that Avril's heart was placed into it.

This thought was so far from being true. I was amazed at the variety of different music genres Avril has encoporated into her album. From ballads like \\"Tomorrow\\", \\"Things I'll Never Say\\", and \\"Anything But Ordinary\\" with powerful lyrics like \\"is it enough to love/is it enough to breath/somebody rip my heart out and leave me here to bleed\\". To songs like \\"Losing Grip\\", and \\"Unwanted\\" which reveal that edgy \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" sound. Whatever your music prefernce may be, I'm sure you can make an acception and go pick it up.

However I was definitely surprised what a great talent. I really enjoy this cd along with Complicated other great songs are: Anything but Ordinary (probably my most favorite song), Mobile, My World, Unwanted and I'm with you. She's not your run of the mill teen singer she's got talent and can write her own stuff!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Something about Avril","review":"There are magazines - reviews - fans - songs - and the new Avril Lavigne CD, Let Go. I listen 2 radio stations like Kiss (96.1) or B-94 (93.7), and as soon as I turn my radio on there is some Avril Lavigne song on like Complicated or Sk8r Boi. And there it is. As soon as I hear one of her songs twice, I'll know the whole thing.Avril is between images. She has songs that play on the radio about 50 times a-day, and others that people skip sometimes. Her Pink-Britney style has brought her a long way and I recomend this CD to anyone who has good taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Punk Rock and totally hot!","review":"Avril Lavigne's new CD debut Let Go is totally awesome!!!

Almost all the songs are really good, and even though it's not really punk, (sounds more like pop) she has great songs. Complicated, Things I'll Never Say, My World, and others are catchy, and fun. This CD is one of the best I have listened to...too bad she has such a bad personality."},{"rating":"1","title":"The music is okay, but her image is not","review":"this cd is not bad by any means. She has some talent so im not going to say that she doesnt. If you buy this CD because the music is cool , then great! But dont buy the CD because you think she is all origional and is \\"different\\" then the britneys and christinas... because she is not. If you want to buy the CD of someone who has talent and isint trying to be someone she isint buy Vanessa Carlton's CD, she is extremely talented and i have yet to see one sign of fakeness in her image... the same cannot be said for miss avril"},{"rating":"2","title":"Avril Rocks the Stage","review":"I love Avril because she has some great rock and roll songs which lots of people love and it has alot of compassion like Sk8er Boi.She sould do some more songs and more concerts,I think Complicated is boring but I like that song.I just love Sk8er Boi.That song makes me jump up in the air.Her songs have alot of compassion because she jumps, stands and tells people how she feels when she sings on stage.Please drop all the lame bands like Play and get this wonderful CD.It's the best CD you can ever have. Maybe it's much better than a video(VHS) and a DVD.P.S Please pick up Avril Lavinge.P.S.S If you have lame CDs drop those and get Avril Lavinge!"},{"rating":"2","title":"you guys","review":"Let's face it, today if a girl is singing a music genre that is mainly made up of men, then they are .all going to tell her that she's not who she claims to be. Which is not punk. You can be a punk and not sing punk music. i've never heard her claim to sing punk. Besides, if Blink 182 changed Skater Boy to Skater girl and sung it, punks out there would have been screaming the lyrics like no tommorow. The Rock Show is a very similar song to me. But the female voice makes it \\"poppy\\" sounding. Avril Lavigne is only 17 years old. She's already devoloped her voice and sings and writes her OWN music which is more than I can say for allot of other bands out there. Alanis Morrisette, Blink 182 and allot of other bands out there didn't hit it big with their first album but we don't dig out \\"Budda\\" and say how much it sucks. This is her first album, give her a chance to get a little older and come out with a few more album's before we throw her in the garbage. I think she has allot of potential"},{"rating":"2","title":"it's a good listen that's definetly pop","review":"...Avril makes it seem as if pop has actually become good. I am into the hardest rock you could think of, and even I love this cd. It is an awesome buy and songs like \\"Things I'll never say\\" and \\" Nobody's Fool\\" make her awesome vocals seem even better. So go out and buy it, you have nothing to lose. There are only about 2 mediocre songs in it, and that's definetly a safe bet..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new rock revolution led by a female teen has begun...","review":"Avril Lavigne can certainly make a good rock record that would lift you six feet off the ground. As for me, I really love this CD; I never get bored listening to her, on the contrary, you'd simply fall in love with her music by every repeated listening. My favorites are \\"Losing Grip\\" and \\"My World\\", though I think all songs are all just as excellent.I believe this album would appeal to guys a lot; it has already carried me away. Finally I've found a good female voice that I can enjoy listening to.So, to all you guys out there: throw Britney Spears in the trash and rock along to Avril Lavigne instead! You'd love her more than all the Britney clones in the world!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Cd Ever","review":"When Avril's first hit came out, complicated, I never gave it much thought. A few months later I heard people talking about it and decided to give it a try. I'm not usually a fan of this t ype of music, but this cd is worth every penny and there is something for everyone. I listen to this cd NON STOP. Definately a good buy. My favourite songs are....Too much to ask, Things I'll never say, Sk8r Boi, Anything but Ordinary, and I'm with you.Don't wait any longer, this cd is the best one out there"},{"rating":"1","title":"Here We Go!","review":"Avril Lavigne debut Let Go is a collection of meaningless, boring songs. There are not a one song that is really good on this album. the lyrics are imaturity and childish, the music which often is very cliche and indeed no originality to it.I Must say that I Give Arista and Laface records credit for discovering a girl and make her a big star overnight without taking off her clothes but indeed the music and the album stinks and I think the word punk rock is a bit stupid when it comes to this it's like saying that Britney Spears is a heavy metal act and she will be performing next Ozzfest. please give me a break."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jennie'z Avril Lavigne Review","review":"Ever heard that rockin' song \\"complicated\\" on the radio and wondered who sings it? WellI'll tell you who, the awesome Avril Lavigne. Her C.D. Is the best thing you can pick upthis year! 13 full length tracks, and unlike many other artists she writes her own music.From her rockin' tune \\"Sk8er Boi\\" to her slower more calm song \\"I'm with you\\" You getfull absolutely awesome music accompanied by the lyrics written by 17 year old, smalltown Canadian girl Avril Lavigne. And if that isn't enough you find all of the lyrics insideof the little front booklet, as well as pictures. She isn't fake like those other artists, shesings about real experiences that have happened to her and I can relate to almost everysong and I'm sure you could as well. So next time your anywhere where you could buy aC.D. don't hesitate to pick up Avril's first C.D. \\"Let Go\\" It's well worth your while!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Music/dancer fan","review":"Avril Lavigne is one of my favorite artists.

My favorite track is My World."},{"rating":"1","title":"What kind of a name is Avril anyway?","review":"She can't even spell. Say it with me, \\"B-O-Y.\\" Plus, she's shallow, since she only wants him once he's famous, and she dumb--dumb--dumb--dumb. Vocal chord removal is the only option. Also, someone ought to steal all her pencils so that she can't write all that dumb stuff. Then, last of all, fill her ears with cheeseballs and her nostrils with sorbet. Tie her up and beat her up and throw her out of Babylon. And she has a funny nose. Worse than Michelle Kwan's. And weird eyes. She looks like a demon. Is she into Satanic worship? I met her at the mall once and she was wearing a pentagram necklace and black lipstick and she was singing, \\"Oops, I did it again\\" by Britney Spears. So she's really just a little teenie-bopper. Get a life. Get two of them. Get a whole barrel of lives.

Wake UP!!!","review":"First off, I must say that due to reasons beyond my control, I could not give this CD the rating it deserves (ZERO!!!). Anyways...WHY was it decided that punk was the cool new thing to love? Don't get me wrong, I love it, but this certainly isn't it. Avril's just a new marketing scam, designed to rob you of your hard-earned cash. And that goes for all the other groups people are considering punk these days (Blink 182, and their millions of clones!) But now onto Avril. Is she punk? No way!!! Can she play guitar? Nope! And she's sure not a good role model either. She's a spoiled brat, and her music is terrible. PLEASE people, spend your money on something worthwhile. Together, we can bring down the pop-punk empire! That is all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank Goodness for Technology","review":"I heard Avril Lavigne \\"sing\\" live in concert last month. My God!Miss Lavigne should get down on her knees and thank the Lord for TC-Helicon's VoiceOne program, which allows sound engineers to modulate the pitch and timbre of the human voice, mainly so they can correct bad intonation and beef up a thin, puny voice. It's a godsend to talentless singers everywhere. Without it, Avril would have no recording career at all. She's that bad, folks.Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to scrub the inside of my skull with boric acid and steel wool in a vain attempt to scour from my memory all traces of that dismal travesty of a concert. Oh, the humanity!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Laughing......","review":"Avril makes the music industry a big huge joke! Her lyrics are kiddish, some of them don't even make any sense! If you wanna buy an Avril-like album go and buy Sum41. Because Sum41 has the same type of music but in a good form. Avril sounds like a dying cow! You could have hearing phobia for months (which I know hearing phobia isn't a word.) So anyway to wrap up this message: DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM BECAUSE YOU'LL WASTE EIGHTEEN DOLLARS ON CRAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Terrible CD!!!!!!","review":"Every time I hear Avril Lavigne I want to vomit! She claims that she isn't punk and then turns around and says that she is. Her songs are boring with childish lyrics and are disgraced with her terrible voice. She sings songs that have no meaning or depth. She is probably the most fake person in the music industry right now. Avril Lavigne needs to rethink the image that she's portraying because she looks like a poser and has lost the respect of everyone who is truly punk."},{"rating":"2","title":"I HAVE IT! U NEED IT! ...","review":"let me just give u the point.

She has some room to grow lyrically like in one of her song lyrics (I'm not the milk in Cheerios in your spoon) She isn't [mad] like Alanis Morissette, she's not teen beauty queen like Britney Spears. She's looks like the one of the better looking punk rock people in this Gener and her band members fit the picture of rejected members of Sum 41. All in All they make a perfect band with great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Avril Lavigne: Punkin It Up","review":"Avril lavigne has to be one of the raddest punkest chicks ever. With her down to earth personality and raw lyrics on her new album \\"Let Go\\" it is definately going to take her far. She reminds me so much of myself and finally there is a postive role model for teenage girls in the music business. it is about time. Her music on the cd varies from a poppy track (Complicated) and gets punker and more hardcore as she goes. Therefore appealing to many different audiences. At a young age of seventenn I am sure we will be hearing much much more from this Candian artist. Hope to catch her on tour soon in the States!!Much love & Rock Out![-Tara Lyn-]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for vapid teenage girls only","review":"This little kid sure is bitter considering she's only 17 and she's signed onto a major record label. She writes her own lyrics about running around in winter, wearing shorts and complaining that it's cold, and then going home with a stranger. If you're under 18 and you think you're tough and bitter and punk, you're wrong. But the good news is, you'll like Avril Lavigne! If you're looking for hard-rocking women, try L7 or the Lunachicks.

From one to ten, I would rate this CD a 10. Why? I just said so!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Melodic Skater PUNK!","review":"Who ever thought this was possible?

She's so rad!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Who says girls dont rule?","review":"I was pleasantly suprised by the sound of new comer teen Avril Lavigne. From her first single \\"Complicated\\" I knew she was a female not afraid to speak her mind, and who has her own style. Though the album trails away from what we expected, it is a nice mix and glimpse into her diverse listening pleasures. Two outstanding tracks that grabbed my attention were the first single \\"Losing Grip\\" which burst into a vocal blast of vulnerability and strength simultaneously. My next favorite, \\"With You\\" reminds many of us of times when we felt alone and confused in this world and instead of taking it out on someone personally she expresses herself through song. I admire Avril for her song writing skills and honesty and individuality. \\"ANYTHING BUT ORDINARY\\" rings true in an honest and at times shocking visual of her words. I give this album a high recommendation. If you dont have it, i recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"why?","review":"people think avril is diferent. avril thinks avril is difrent. cloud thinks avil is BOR-RING. her sogs are fine, the guitar playing is so/so, there are two aspects of av-ey that bug me. one: she just another soft spoken pop-princes. two: that she sells her self by looking like a skater-punk but her songs are more fit for alicia keys! it you really want original pick up some vitamin C or sheilla nicholls or eve or india arie. or someone who deosnt need the clothes or looks cause they have tallent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great All Around Album...","review":"This one is now a family favorite and on a recent 12 hour road trip (each way), I believe we played it at least 20 times through...

I really like punk music and i have punk friends..but that doesn't mean i am a PUNK because i mean thats just not me. I think Avril is very confused and it shows in her songs.

She can win all the awards she wants. She can let other people write most of her music all she wants. She can grab the attention of 7th graders all she wants. She can also grab my brother's attention all she wants. She can pretend that her songs are really hers and that she wasn't massively aided by people in the studio. (Look at the insert, \\"written by Lavigne and... [Insert name here]). She can also say that she plays the guitar. Looking at the music videos she doesn't really, or plays as least amount of chords as possible. Well that sums up a lot of it. Oh yeah, she can say she doesn't suck when in reality, we've already heard this before and it SUCKS VERY VERY VERY HARD. She can also say this isn't clich��, but I think you can guess what I can say about that."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm the sid vicious of our generation..!","review":"so sid vicious, what's the name of the band you're in? Oh yeah you don't know, because you suck. Don't say you're something to try and appeal to the masses cause you're gonna get burned. If you don't know what i'm talking about, look it up and I swear if you have any kind of respect you'll burn this CD as homage to the guy Avril supposedly is. Here's a break down of the cd for ya.songs 1 through however many songs she has on this crapjob:sound like a country album. I guess this is punk if punk is canadian for Leann Rhymes. Avoid this CD like a fat kid to a mountain of broccoli.\\"take off all your preppy clothes...\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep doin what your doin, even if not everybody likes it!","review":"Avril Lavigne may not be the most original \\"new kid on the block\\", but even if she sounds like alanis, shes great! Has anyone thought that writing for yourself, and not the media, is probably the best music you're gonna get? Avril is merely emulating her peers. Not everybody has to develop a totally new style of music to be a wonderful singer and songwriter. In fact, I'm listening to \\"too much to ask\\", and it states that \\"you cant see the world through a mirror\\". Thats probably the most inteligent thing ive heard since Pink's \\"he taught me about peace and all the great things we take advantage of\\"If you say that Avril is lacking in newness, i think you're wrong.

Don't waste your money on this crap. It's not worth it. I give every song on this CD an F and a 0/10. Get real people, her music is horrible! She claims to be punk-rock, when she's really just pop. I am not suprised that she hasn't made a second album. I am just warning the helpless, don't waste your money on this! Avril is also a poser and a loser. She is so phoney, no wonder people buy her stuff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Album Should Die","review":"This is a pop album, not rock. Deluded fans take note! I would call it humorous but it just annoys me. Can't sing, the voice is singing and beyond tuneful.The songs are horrid and cringeful. Who would call a song sk8er boi with serious face? The lack of dignity is shocking.I can't beleive someone would put a song as bad as 'naked' on an album. And i'd be embarassed if 'mobile' was on my album.Though I must praise Avril for starting the craze of long straight hair and tomboy clothing for teenage girls, it means I can wear my fairy clothes without embarassment. I love my fairy clothes.A girl living opposite my house loves this album. She plays it loud sometimes. Pity me please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poser","review":"Yeah, i like the songs, they're actually pretty ok, but I agree with everyone that she is ver un-punk, her clothes are wannabe, and she should just say \\"this is pop\\" and be done with it.

This cd is nothing special, dont waste ur money."},{"rating":"1","title":"this makes me go hmmm","review":"well i thnk that what avril was trying to do here is be \\"rebelius\\" and still make millions. and she did that by dresing as a skater/punk and singing as a prep. that way she apeals to everyone, right? not really. to me that sounds like reversed logic.her songs in thems selves could be much better but are generaly lisnable and easy to realate to, so what the problem? well one would be that she manages to confuse us with her melded styles. another is that we have no way to really classify her. so she goes as a poser. well luckily only \\"people magazine\\" made the mistake of calling her music punk (play that punk-ey music)what I'm attempting to say is, sure buy the CD,but expect rude coments.some where i read that she sounded like gwen from no doubt. that make me laugh. i'de like to see her try and pull a song like \\"trapped in a box\\" and \\"oi to the world.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow.","review":"Either Avril writes the worst lyrics ever or she should fire the person that writes them for her. \\"I like you the way you are when we're driving in your car.\\" ?!?!?!?!?

Avril is a loser. shes a hipocrite who thinks she's punk then throws all this guitar pop music at us while flashing the rock on sign. unless you are a girl under 12, get a clue, haven't you heard her live???!!! she even sucks then. GOD i don't know what to say to get people to realize what the stupid corporate media is trying to feed them. the lyrics suck, Avril sucks, her voice sucks, her guitar skills suck, her skatboarding skills suck, her people skills suck and this album sucks.

How can you call someone whodoesn't cuss exept for like two songs because her mother doesn't like it a rebel?And all she sings about are boyfriends and love.If she didn't call herself punk and didn't diss other popstars exactly like her i wouldn't care.Avril lavigne is only an excus for little girlswho all they care about are their nails to say they listen to punk rock and are punk while they listenin pop.They play her in limited 2 all the time.I mean I can't play guitar but I don't go around telling everybody I do, when I so obviously can't"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a \\" Complicated \\" kind of music","review":"Avril Lavigne is one of those artists who believes that music and self expression is easily achieved, my belief is that, though such a loose evolving step in music ( like much junk out there ), the music is so easy to digest and to listen that it makes an unfair attempt in reveal her true persona, personally, if i were to listening punk i'd listen Black Flag ( of course, that IS punk )or the Exploited or the Birmingham Crass, but anyway that's something people does not see and therefore does not understand easily, so, buy it if you want, but do not expect a manifesto or a political or mental revolution"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is BRILLIANT!","review":"What are all you Avril haters complaining about? Are you not listening to the amazingly brilliant lyrics on this album?

Keep up the good work Avril!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely not letting go of this album for awhile","review":"I'm a professed hardcore Britney Spears fan. I admit it. But that doesn't mean I'm not open to other genres of music, and Avril Lavigne's style is in my opinion totally awesome; it's punk but it's pop too, and that sits at a perfect balance of mainstream and not-so-typical. Her 2002 debut Let Go is a definitely worthwhile entry in today's Britney-hyped music and skyrocked to the top of the charts with her co-penned No. 1 smash \\"Complicated,\\" which kinda became that summer's most popular song. Every song on this sterling record could be hit and that makes Let Go even more irresistible. Congrats, Avril...and to quote your song: \\"I'm with you.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Let Avril Go...","review":"I have been perplexed by the success of this wannabe poser, who claims to be ultra-talented and so \\"cutting edge\\". Please.... Avril Levine is another one of those flashes in the pan, who happened to get a good album producing team. For all of you who think Avril is so \\"brilliant\\" for coming up with this new sound, please give credit where it is due: her producers. It drives me crazy when singers proclaim their own genius--and neglect to admit that their sound is completely fabricated by their production team. Madonna is another one of these types."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drop an anvil on Avril","review":"She said it best herself in her lame little song... \\"It's all been done before\\". You sure got THAT right. Someone needs to tell this little pep-rally prep she's not hardcore. She needs to get it thru her Easy-Bake-Oven-head that she's really just Britney with clothes on.If Avril is punk, then Shania Twain is deathmetal."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Pitiful\\"","review":"Avril Lavigne is an example of how far computers have gotten. I do agree that her songs are catchy and fun but when she's live, her voice is incredibly raspy and terrible. What you do is take an average Canadian girl and use a computer to create her voice, make millions of dollars, and then throw her out of your company. Second, Lavigne is a disgrace to both punk and rock. While rock and punk lyrics are supposed to discuss anger, depression, and sadness, Avril Lavigne sings about her boyfriend dumping her or the other way around. She's a failure and her lyrics fully support that. 1 star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Punk meets Grunge","review":"For too long the music industry has been flooded by Boy and Girl bands with only two things going for them. They can just about hold a note and they look good. Avril Lavigne, thankfully, bucks this trend. She is also talented. While many of her peers are stage managed and made up, Lavigne writes and performs songs of such talent that the music does the talking and the publicists are redundant. The confessional style lyrics of I'm With You are complimented by the pop/punk style of Sk8er Boy. This Album is a stunning Debut that defys her years. Lavigne's style covers so many boundaries that comparisions with the like of Alanis Morrisette and Pink are nothing more than a waste of words. It has been a long time since a debut album with the range of Let Go has reached the mainstream"},{"rating":"2","title":"Many good songs","review":"It's hard to describe music, because it's so personal and all a matter of taste. Avril's music is definitely worth buying the CD. She has a strong voice, although not as mature as some others out there.Also, if you play the CD on your computer or DVD player, you will be happily surprised."},{"rating":"2","title":"why not?","review":"I find the whole thing really interesting. Musicwise, I think it's very nice work... pop with nice vocal. As far as image is concerned, even recording companies recognize that they can't just keep pumping out Britney alike. Image, of course, is everything if you want to sell something especally in the States. And recording companies are in the business of selling.Only at sixteen, I think Lavigne did a terrific job. I truely enjoyed the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Rocks!!!","review":"This CD rocks!!! Its 1 of the best... and for all the ppl who think otherwise... well theyr just losers, they dont have any taste. I think avril is a great singer with alot of talent. And this CD is worth buyin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet","review":"The cd of this new talent, is really good, the songs are nice and the lyrics too, i think that Avril isnt just a one hit wonder, probably she will stay a long time, BUT, i think that the last songs of the album aren't as great as the first ones, but if you wanna hear something new, buy it, you might be surprised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scpetic Sis Falls In Like","review":"When my 16 (I'm 24) yr old sister (who used to listen to Britney Spears and all that) came to vist and brought with her this CD I thought it was just another synthesized pop production. When I heard it I thought it was more my type of music than her's (I'm a big classic rock, country and Phish fan). It brought me back to the days when Hole first came out...after being madly in love with Kurt Cobain through most of my early teen years I was anxious to find out what Courtney's music was like. Although I know Avril is younger than Courtney was at the time, she has a sort of edge on her music that had been lacking from the pop music scene. I'm thrilled to see this album on top. Maybe this new music isn't as bad as I have thought in the last few years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something \\"Small Kids\\" would listen 2.....","review":"Well, her record is cool, except I would classify it as \\"play\\" rock- if there is such thing. I dig Losing Grip (Though it sounds distinctly familiar......), Tomorrow, Anything But Ordinary, And My Wold. There are 13 tracks in all, so I guess it would we worth buying. But as of the moment, m really SIK of Complicated already, but it sounded nice when I first heard it. Sk8er Boi (Skater Boy would have been better) [is bad]! As in, lotsa songs sound exactly like it. My Advice to you is this- Yeah sure, she's pretty and all, but you could spend your money on something better......"},{"rating":"1","title":"one and a half star because she plays guitar...","review":"I applaud this youngster for creating on real insturments instead of just hiring a guy to lay down a bunch of lazy electronic nothing. That said,it's about all that sets this apart from the rest of the lackluster music that everybody seems to love. It's the same old same old-but god bless you if it bakes your bread. Her youthful \\"sexuality\\" is on display here,if in a much more dignified way than Miss Spears. If you think it's not you're fooling yourself. For once when you say the lyrics sound like they are the poetry of a teenage girl it's really true. Man these are some boring and simple words set to very average musical backing. These songs are lightweight and full of \\"attempted\\" depth. All I can say is that maybe she will grow up with her fans and make some music that's got some meat to it. Sk8 on down to the record shop and try again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jealous?","review":"Jealous? Not really. Just puzzled and deeply annoyed.I can't answer for others, but what annoys me is that there are LOTS of other, far more talented people who will NEVER get the promotion and publicity they deserve. (And I'm NOT talking about myself or any members of my family.) When someone with no discernable talent whatsoever gets this kind of insane saturation promotion by the record industry, it's a fair question to ask why. There are girls at my local high school who can sing and dance and play guitar much better that Avril can. So, like an earlier reviewer asked, WHY HER?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just the Facts","review":"Here are the facts:She doesn't write her own music. A team of professionals is commissioned by the record label to compose the music for her.She doesn't play an instrument. She is obviously faking her guitar playing on stage, because the chords and rhythms she is strumming don't even match the songs she's singing.She can't sing. I've heard her perform live and she sounded really lousy--completely out of tune and harsh. On her albums, the record company has obviously corrected her bad singing using hi-tech computer programs to cover up her totally inadequate voice.There are so many real musicians and songwriters out there. Don't waste your money on this phony."},{"rating":"1","title":"<----- Should say 0!!!","review":"The only good thing about Avril Lavigne is that one day, she (along with countless others) will go belly-up, just like Tiffany, NKOTB, Backstreet Boys, and the many others that have done so before her. But really, what can I say about Avril that hasn't been said millions of times before? We all know she's a talentless poser created by the industry to cash in on ridiculous fads, right? I predict her next album \\"Under My Skin\\", will be her last. Truely, I cannot wait for the day that this madness will end. Avoid her like the plague!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Let Go Overview","review":"I thought this CD was great for her first one. Unlike what some people say, these songs aren't the normal, repetitive style songs you hear on the radio everyday. This CD is definately worth your money. The only downside is that she is a bit too into the bad girl/punk idea. But thats not for me to judge. If you want to hear music from someone who is not your sterotyped signer, listen to \\"Let Go.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Let go","review":"Let go, The debut album from Rocker and vocalist avril lavigne is totally WICKED.it contains her 4 of her 6 hit singles (complicated,sk8er boi,im with you,losing grip) wich is good enough.

Avril is in it just for the money, and attention. The marketing industries think that is she dresses \\"punk\\" than these teeny boppers will think that it really is. Yes, this was directed at all of you Avril loving teenage girls that think Avril and Good Charlotte and hard-core as you like to call it. Punk used to be about rebellion and anarchy, not love relationships. You posers should learn what REAL hard-core music is, like hard-core METAL and PUNK. Stuff like The Misfits is REAL punk, but that might make your virgin ears bleed. And my favorite metal band, CRADLE OF FILTH!!!!!! Go listen to them you darn teeny boppers and tell me what you think, you have my sympathy and regards however.I know that review by Stacey was a long time ago, but if you are reading this Stacey,I just wanted to inform you that your review made me vomit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"This is a great debut effort. The songs and lyrics are really amazing along with the vocals. Great cd. 5/5 Great job, AV!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well . .. .","review":"People have told me that the only reason I hate Avril is becuase I dislike her image. They say I should listen to her for her music. What they are missing is that her music is really not that good. Her voice isn't so bad, but after a few songs I get so annoyed I can't think. Her music to me just sounds corny. Her songs don't really have any depth at all. I just don't like the sound of them. Usually, the gutair is my favorite part of a song, but not in this album. It just sounds . . .blah. So, in conclusion, I do not like Avril becuase her music is terribly bad. Sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"A helpful girl.","review":"Avril Lavigne's lyrics are very well writen, and seem to speak directly to the listener. Most people could relate to what she sings about, and that's what people like to hear. She's got very cute manerisms with her voice, such as her pronounciation of \\"r.\\" Over all, this is a Cd that you can listen straight through without skipping any tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a dud on the whole album!","review":"I bought this album for my 14-year-old daughter, and she brought it along on a recent road trip. I already liked the four releases from the CD, and when I listened to the complete CD, I was amazed to hear that every single song was a winner. Very talented little gal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Mind the Bollocks...","review":"Forget about the image. Forget about whether she is or is not a \\"punk\\" or a \\"phony\\". Forget about whether she did or did not write the songs, or whether she can or cannot play.The fact is, this is a strong debut CD, with very little filler. While some of the lyrics sound like they were written by a 16 year-old (lending support to the argument that she did at least HELP to write the songs), it does not overshadow the fact that the playing is tight and the hooks are catchy. She handles the ballads and the up-tempo material with equal skill.View this for what it is...a very good POP disc that you should not feel ashamed to own. Nothing more. Nothing less. And sometimes, especially in light of the Jeschritney Simpspaguilera product that is still out there, that is not a bad thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let Go","review":"Well first of all Avril Lavigne is pop not punk-rock Even if you hate her you got to admit she's got catchy songs and some of them are good But honestly \\"Anything but Ordinary\\" is kinda of dumb saying stuff like \\"Sometimes I get so wierd,I even freak myself out\\" Her CD is great to people who like pop but to the rock-punk people not really \\"Sk8ter Boi\\" is the only song on Let Go close to punk While \\"Unwanted\\" is the most rock you'll probarly hear on this CD As for Avril she is kinda fake.She dresses punk and says am tough and stuff but sings pop but well some people do that and I don't really have a big problem with it.She coulden't play guitar before but all of a sudden she plays better noe as for her voice live She used to suck and really bad but now her voice at live perfomances is better But if your into Britney Spears this is great cd>It's just pop with a few guitars on the back"},{"rating":"2","title":"She beats Britney for sure!","review":"Wow! I wouldn't have ever thought I'd want a CD as much as I wanted this one. I had to go to 3 different places to finally find it! People thought I was crazy because I was having a fit when I couldn't find it. This CD is the best CD I own! I'm a total Britney Spears fan but Avril has got Britney beat big time!

This is a CD everyone should own, young and old. GO OUT AND BUY IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Avril Rox!","review":"Avril is the most original and great artist ive seen in years. She has the most unique and powerfull voice. Shes not afraid to be different and doesnt feel the need to be another belly showing pop star. Hr music shows the different sides of her. Some Pop, Punk, Rock and some Mellow. My choice song is Losing Grip but her single Complicated is also Very Great! Infact the whole album rocks. She so wrote them all and sure does have talent! For a punker song check out Sk8er Boi which tells a story all in its self and for a rockin song check out Unwanted. Buy the album and you wont regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible voice","review":"I do not like the new teenage pop queens, but heard Avril perform \\"Sk8er Boi\\" on a TV show, and liked her music.

She deserves all that comes from this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mix of a great bunch of female artists","review":"I bought this CD because my friend and I fell in love with \\"Complicated\\" and \\"I'm With You.\\" I bought the CD, and what I heard was what sounded like a mix of Alanis Morissette, Gwen Stefani (Sk8er Boi), Michelle Branch, Pink, and I am sure a bunch of other artists I am leaving out. \\"Complicated,\\" \\"My World\\", and \\"Anything But Ordinary\\" are my favorite tracks. If you like the artists listed above, you'll love Avril. This is a great CD to sing with and if you are a lover of female rock artists, the CD is definitely worth buying"},{"rating":"2","title":"We are going to be seing more of this girl","review":"Wow this is just the best cd ever i love it. you can just put it on and listen to it from begining to end. You can get so into the music and really understand what she is talking about. She puts alot of her heart and soul into every song.Losing grip is a good song with alot of emotion. Complicated is just great you have it stuck in your head all week. Skater boy is cool cause its like a story and you just want to listen to it over and over. i'm with you is a great song also.I just found myself repeating over and over My World, Things ill Never Say, Nobody's Fool well gee all of them. Anything But ordinary is great to you can really relate to it i mean nobody really wants to be ordinary. All of the songs are great im with you and naked were great also.She just has so much emotion an she displays it beautifly."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Excellent!","review":"Avril Lavigne is amazing!

GO CANADA!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Avril's music touches the soul.","review":"Have you ever been hurt? Angry? Alone? Confused? Well Avril is your girl! Her lyrics aren't all boys, boys, boys! She deals with real issues that run through one's head. If you are upset with something and want to cry and vent, this is your cd. The album is split with music to just listen and relax to, others are pump up music. But all of Avril's songs are ones that you can sing along and scream too. This is the best music that is out there today! She's not fake or phony and this album proves it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AVRIL","review":"This is my favorite CD she ever made I love this CD. tho I find it sad that the rest of her music after this went downhill and is trash"},{"rating":"2","title":"Avril Lavigne!","review":"Let Go is an awesome album! it's one of those albums where you can listen to it from beginning to end, without having to skip any tracks. Avril is different from a lot of the other artists out there and her sound is her own. There's something for every mood your in. Avril's songs are unique and you can feel her pain and emotions while listening to her. Her style is cool too and she does what she feels is right for her and doesn't just go with what everyone else is doing. She's a cool... skater-punk chick who's gonna take over!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Even minus her reputation, the CD isn't that great.","review":"Alright, this CD is not punk. It is pop. And a mediochre pop CD at that.It's good for humming along and tapping your toes. It is not good if you are looking for music with meaningful lyrics or moving melodies (in fact, lyrics such as \\"I'm not the milk and cheerios in your spoon\\" make me outright laugh.)Personally, I think you should listen to a CD if you like the music, regardless of what other people say about the artist. Period.And I'll admit, I actually used to listen to this CD a lot when I was, say, 15. But I've matured and so have my music tastes.Avril Lavigne is only good for so long. You eventually out-grow her, as you do with all empty music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special","review":"Avril Lavigne's debut album is a cheesy, extremely shallow pop cd. It's catchy, of course (The choruses are bound to stay in your head for das after the first listen), and her vocals are unique and quirky, but the lyrics are the most immature, akward lines I can think of. The \\"deeper\\" she tries to be, the plainer and more moronic it gets. I found the album average and boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexplainable","review":"I think that this cd is without a doubt one of the best cd's that have debuted in a long time. Here we have 17 year old new talent that can sing, perform and start trends. In her music she explains what every teen at her age goes through. Especially the girls. The girls that like to skateboard can sometimes go through heat and just think Avril could have to. In her song \\"Complicated\\" the lyric says, \\"Your Somebody else round everyone else.\\" That lyric is just explaining how you could be one person at one time and then change just because another person thats supposely cool comes around. See how easy that was to understand. Anyone can relate to it. It's just all around a great cd. If you listen to the words, it's like a poem. But a very talented one. I know that Im probably making no sense to whom ever this concerns, but if you think about it, Im right. Well this cd just rocks."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Something So New, It Got Old Fast","review":"I liked this CD the first five times I listened through it. After that, all the songs started to sound the same and I realized how annoying her voice got. Her lyrics are less than original and no where near creative.Doesn't really take a genius to rhyme 'red' with 'head.' Example: \\"My cheeks are turning red\\" to \\"I'm searching for the words inside my head\\" (taken from Things I'll Never Say).The beat gets repeatitive. And what really ticks me off is the fact she yodels in \\"I'm With You.\\" If you can't carry a note for that long, just soften it up or edit it out. Don't butcher a good song by sounding like you have the hiccups.Note to all those judging her image: This isn't a picture. It's a CD. A CD has music on it. Listen to the CD before you critize (sp?) the music and artist. So what if she says she's punk and doesn't sing it, she can say she's a donkey for all I care. She's a singer, not a role model. It's the music that counts anyways."},{"rating":"2","title":"sk8er girl of punk music","review":"This cute girl can really rock and roll. The tracks really do electrify. This is no COMPLICATED artist. I doubt she'll ever be LOSING GRIP. I think SK8ER BOI is an awesome track. Avril LaVigne is the closest thing to heavy metal. This chick is really MOBILE when on stage. So continue to play that punky music,white girl or honkette!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Lyrics!!","review":"Avril Lavigne's Let Go is an awesome Cd. She has a great sound and should keep belting out those songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the finest punk rockers I listen to","review":"Avril Lavigne is pure genius. She writes such great songs. I can't really tell you my favorite punk rock song she has composed, since all of them are 5 stars. For other great punk rock bands check out Green Day, Sum 41, Blink 182, Good Charlotte, Rancid, and Ataris."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let Go","review":"Let Go is a great CD. It mixes rock tunes, slow songs, and upbeat, fun songs all into one CD that's definately worth buying. Avril, unlike some singers today, truly has talent, and deserves to be given a chance.The only problems you might have with this CD are that Avril cusses in some songs, and this isn't a CD you could listen to over and over without feeling a little depressed.Other than that, I'd say this is a really good CD.P.S. Please don't \\"review\\" my review. Reviews are to be used to speak your opinion, not your opinion of someone else's."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm an old lady...","review":"...but I really dig Avril's CD. Is that strange? I don't care for her baggy pants/skater attitude, but the music is great! Funny as it sounds, Sk8ter Boi is my favorite song on that CD. There are few CDs that I can listen to all the way through, but I can this one. Whether you're a fan or hers or not, the music is really catchy and ejoyable to listen to.By the way, I'm 37. I can stil enjoy new music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"wow","review":"i can not believe this. i think that avril lavigne is one of the worst singers/artists i've ever heard.

Her music is a mix of pop rock and soft punk rock some might compare to Alanis Morisette. She write the lyric to her songs about her feelings. She is very Original and I would recommend this CD to those sick of Britney Spears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rounding the Bend of Sanity","review":"What justifies this \\"artist\\" getting 4 1/2 stars, average review?

Not to mentions there isn't any song on the album she wrote alone, I guess she only has enough talent to \\"co-write\\" all 13 songs. Not to mention, \\"Complicated, Skater Boy, and i'm with you were all written by the Matrix, and although she co-wrote her latest single with less people, it's still horrible. The music avarge, the guitar playing is avarge, she's avarge. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ALBUM. You'll listen to it 3 or 4 times and then wanna throw it out your window. People think she's so cool because she's punk, but seriouly a lot of people dress like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avril=Average","review":"After hearing many great things about this 'new' artist, Avril Lavigne, I figured to spend the extra 12 bucks to buy the C.D. But after listening through it, plus seeing her many \\"in your face\\" T.V. and magazine appearances, I was very confused by her image. One minute I'm listening to the very anti-preppy, punk rockish \\"Sk8er Boi\\" and the next minute I'm listening to the very popish \\"I'm With You\\". Sure she writes her own lyrics, and I will give her credit for that. But then when you hear a song like \\"I'm With You\\" and dont even know what she's singing about it becomes a bit agrivating. Though she says she's been called the \\"Anti-Britney\\" or the \\"Punk Rock Princess\\", I find this album to be very poppy and I was hardly impressed. Her voice is nothing special and her image is way off. I do not reccomend this C.D. to anyone who is a punk or rock music fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good pop record","review":"OK, so it ain't punk, but then again neither is 'London Calling' ('Sk8er Boi' is more punk than 'Lost in the Supermarket' and 'Train in Vain' combined). 'Sk8er Boi', 'Mobile', and 'Unwanted' are the best songs on this CD. The filler is pretty good, but there is a good amount of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"More more more","review":"That's what this CD leaves you wanting - more. Avril is a very talented teenager and this CD is proof. Well written honest songs and captivating music abound. Definately worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"set it on fire and then put it out with chains","review":"wow, i can't believe this occupies the radio these days. i remember when canadian talent was considered to be IME, the tea party, rush- real bands, not freaking avril. people and bands like avril stop real artists, GOOD artists from getting a chance to carry on or even begin a music career because the radio is clogged with this crap; there isn't any room in the tight rotation of avril, fefe, good charlotte (aka \\"mediocre green day\\" - CR), simple plan, and other soulless bands. if you want to help save radio, music and yourself DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM. However if you wish to continue to take it up the ass from the recording industry and their little puppet, radio, go right ahead but remember that you're going to go to hell for it. cheers"},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"avril should stick to what she does best- pop.i would have no problem with her if she didnt market herself as a punk."},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...","review":"1) can u say 'boring'? most of the lyrics r dull & show no talent2) people only like her cause she looks so cool3) she doesn't have a singing voice; the music covers it upbut on the other hand...i can relate to some of her lyrics, & thats all im gonna say"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not real punk, just easy-to-hear-poprock.","review":"Ok. Avril Lavigne IS NOT a punk rocker. She's a n�� teen idol, in the same path of Britney, Christina or Natalie Imbruglia. She sings some kind of soft pop-rock music, adequate for your little sister or the part of you that will always be 13 year old and wips with \\"Dawson's Creek\\".I think she will be forgotten in two or three years, but you can enjoy this CD as it is: instant soup music or bubblegum rock. If you want real punk rock (Ramones, Sex Pistols, Rancid, the-local-guys-who-play-in-the-funky-hole), you don't even disturb in reviewing it or telling people why they shouldn't listen to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darn Good Music","review":"This CD - Album is really a treat. Musically, it's one good compilation. There's only one track I have difficulty listening to (that's the first one). All the others are very, very good. It's a fresh sound. It's upbeat. It's one of those CDs that doesn't come along very often. The more I see and hear of Avril Lavigne the person (in interviews or on Saturday night live) the less I like Avril the person. However, after 2 years of listening to this CD, I still find it compelling and find myself drawn into the songs.So, in spite of Avril's odd personality, I'm very much looking forward to buying her next album that's due out on May 25th.I can't wait!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AVRIL ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"i like totally love avril!! she is the best singer in the whole wide world and if u don't like it ur just jealous of how hardcore she is! she's a punk princess and i am too, cuz i shop at hot topic and my fave type clothes is dickies! and i have a bad attitude and am not someone u want to mess with!!! i love how she plays guitar, she can play it sooooooooo much better than all of those really ugly heavy metal guys! and her lyrics also really remind me of myself, like in i'm with you and sk8er boy becuz im really just trying to find where i belong and i love other sk8er who carry around their skateboards!!! i sk8 too, i can do an ollie! but yeah she is so cool, if you don't have this cd already you are like the stupidest person in the world!!!! it's so like hard core."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brilliant! Absolutely Brilliant!","review":"This album sounds nothing like Debbie Gibson or Britanny Spears. Lavigne is a true origional. Lyrics like \\"Live for Beer/Smash the state/ Gutter Punks/ Oi Oi Oi etc\\" will keep the punkers happy while the teeny boppers can dig on a tune like \\"Not a girl Not yet a Woman\\"\\"I'm With You\\" is reassuring. If I'm going to the store, she's with me. She's hot and now she's perfectly legal. She may even be nineteen. Go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Girl Rock","review":"Avril Lavigne's real lyrics and guitar driven sound makes this cd a must have. 'Let Go' is one of the best cd's I've seen all year. You can relate to the true lyrics written by Avril herself. Also, the music is origional and anything but pop. If you like former girl rock artists like Alanis Morrisette and Fiona Apple, you will really enjoy Avril Lavigne's cd 'Let Go'."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Rocks","review":"Avril Lavigne rules the rock world!!! She's beautiful. She plays the guitar. She skateboards. And she has this angelic voice. she's like the perfect gurl. ok now to review the cd. the cd is awesome! I saw \\"Complicated\\" on MTV and i fell in love with her and the song. I ran out 5 hours later and i bought 6 copies of the cd. call me obbsesed or call me wat u will. she rocks!!! there's not one song on her album that i dont like. the cd i great. go buy the cd and u wont regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Caveat Emptor,\\" but in a good way...","review":"Despite all the hype and the neckties and the flashing the middle finger at the camera, Avril Lavigne is no more a punk or a skater (or should I say \\"sk8er\\"?) girl than George F. Will.On the other hand, \\"Let Go\\" is a breezy, fun, well-performed and produced album, and Avril Lavigne is now in position to be the next Alanis Morissette. It's not perfect, it's not profound, and it sure as hell isn't punk, but it's a cut above the rest of the Britney/Christina/N*Sync bubblegum music out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"New artist that rocks!","review":"Avril Lavigne, a new artist, is so amazing. She writes her own songs whenever and wherever she feels like it. When you hear her songs you can tell she writes them herself because you can feel that that is how she feels, whats shes going through ,and just like her whole emotions put down on paper. She is the most awesome person I ever heard of. She doesn't need to dress,act,sing like someone else to get peoples attention because she is her own and she doesn't need anyone to make her change the way she looks like other singers just to be popular. Her album \\"Let Go\\" is so good. All her songs , I mean \\"all\\" her songs have deep feelings. That's all I have to say. You guys vote for her on Mtv,Trl. Keep her on the top countdown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Avril is a punk princess ready to rawk out!!","review":"Avril's cd is an all out amazing attempt at getting herself into the race of punk these days. With competitors such as thursday, taking back sunday, something corprate, dashboard confessional ect. its mostly a man's world. Avril is one of the first people I have seen to combine punk without making it pop. Although it is becomming main stream, it is only because of the new population of today's listeners interested (finally) in some real music rather than boybands and pop divas. Avril has ALOT of potential and is going to move up rather quickly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay....but not what she is made up to be","review":"Ya her songs are hits and she is popular and she has rave reviews..and it seems she is at the top of her game...BUT don't go see her in concert..my friend went and he was extremely disappointed unfortunately Avirl does NOT have much of a voice and can't sing at all live..She doesn't seem to care about her fans and thinks her new found stardom is all fun and gamesShe isn't as talented as I and others thought..It's too bad..."},{"rating":"2","title":"One the best cds of 2002!!","review":"This is truly one of the best cds of 2002!

I don't claim to hold the answers to the universe in a little box, but I think we can do a little better than pre-packaged pop-punk trash. Avril can hide behind makeup, hooks written by others, and photo shoots for only so long. Eventually, people have to wake up and see the true movements in the world. Once there was a punk movement. It consisted of artists like The Clash and The Ramones, groups who were actually supporting a viewpoint on life, not conspiring to drain you of money.I hope someday humanity will be able to rise above this fake pop culture. What happened to artistic value? I'm scared of the implications of artists like this making it big. Very scared."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite CD","review":"I Love this CD!

You should really get this CD, it's great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not punk!","review":"If you want punk, look somewhere else. Punk Avril is not. Pop she is. More poppy than punk.

This cd contains some the worst music ever. I'd rather listen to John Travolta or \\"Disco Duck\\" than this. \\"Complicated\\" is one of those songs you would hear over and over again in the burning pits of hell. \\"Sk8tr Boi\\" is bad enough to make your ears bleed. All the other songs suck too! Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"I got addicted","review":"Okay, at first I only got the CD 'cause I liked a couple of the songs. However when I listened to the whole thing through, I got ssoooo addicted. I absolutely LOVE it!! And I don't see the sense in why some of you think she's a poser. Is being who you are and not caring what others think posing? I think not, unless the meaning of \\"poser\\" has drastically changed (which it hasn't). I applaud Avril for being who she is, because THAT is something to admire."},{"rating":"1","title":"She goes pop !!!","review":"This punk album is fair. She screams a lot, so I didn't give her 4 stars. I think it's missing some guitar solos. Excuse me ! But here are even TWO guitarists, and they don't really know how to play guitar !!! If the guitarists would play any guitar solos, this would be perfect. And what I also don't like, are the drums. Here are some techno drums. And this isn't really punk rock. She goes pop in this album. And here is only one punky song. It's SK8ER BOI. I can't hear here a lot of bass. It's missing some bass. I was very dissapointed of this CD. It could be better. I DON'T recommend to buy this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"this some kind of joke???","review":"This is not punk( even though all punk/pop sucks) and she is not rock!!!! well all the little 8 year old preps that want to \\"rebel\\" will love this crap its pahetic, somebody please keep her from writing another album DO NOT BUY THIS!!!In conclusion i think its pathetic that they let her play Metallica's \\"fuel\\" at there tribute show on mtv but wait i think its pathetic that they would let her play any metallica song."},{"rating":"1","title":"um","review":"Why do people like Avril?

She was a new voice for a new generation, she's so Anti-Britney, which made everyone love her. But after a while, things get old. About 4 or 5 times a day I hear this on the radio \\"Uh huh....life's like this...uh huh uh huh that's the way it is\\" Do you know how annoying that is? And the same with Sk8er Boi. And then there's the thing about how she always wears ties and dresses like a guy. What is she, a hermaphrodite? Would it kill her to not wear a tie? I mean seriously. It's like how Alicia Keys always wore her hair in braids, it gets old, and drives me crazy, but I actually like Alicia Keys. I think Avril needs a break. I mean, I'm just so sick of her. She should back off and let other people who talent sing. There are talented people out there who are hardly ever heard. Like Kay Hanley or Nina Gordon. But, who am I to say anything"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cd, but I'm ashamed to like it","review":"Wow, I heard Complicated and it got stuck so i had to buy the cd. It's full of poppy goodness.

But if you listen and the next day you go to school, you're wearing leather spikey thingys and claiming to be punk when just the day before, you were walking around in an abercrombie and fitch shirt and LEI jeans, you just got the wrong idea. AVRIL LAVIGNE IS NOT A PUNK AND WILL NEVER BE A PUNK! She is just a regular pre-fab pop star. The only diffrence is that instead of looking like a whore and singing to dance music, she dresses \\"punk\\" and has some band behind her.

No wonder! I qam not bashing her, I am trying to say she is immature. She has the angst of Alanis Morissette's \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" but nowhere near the talent Morissette has. Although young, she has mucvh to learn. She may have lots to say, however, she needs to taget a more alternative listening group rather than teenie-boppers who wants to be \\"punk rockers\\".

I like her music because she has a lot of different kinds of different songs on it for all the different moods that people have. This is one of the main reasons I love her CD so much.

She's,what,18? At least she even trys to write her own music, unlike Britney Spears who has some guy named Max write for her. I myself am a songwriter and sometimes it is frustrating, although I personally refuse help. After all, I write about MY life not some guy named Max's right? You know what I think? I think Avril is just a girl who wanted to rock out, but was shoved in a pop direction and instead of sacrificing her record deal, she sacrificed her need to rock out. Would you have refused to sing pop even if you would lose a record deal for it?

I listened to this cd expecting to listen to some good pop rock but was dissapointed when all I heard were songs that could have made some singles for Britney Spears if they were slightly toned down. The song \\"Unwanted\\" is especially laughable. You can hear her trying to sing with an edge and fail miserably. The lyrics are so inane (when Lavigne sings \\"take of your preppy clothes,\\" is she talking to herself? Even Aaron Carter and the Backstreet Boys dress more like \\"rock stars\\" though in no way I am implying they are. Another annoyance is the credits for the songs. Lavigne keeps saying she wrote the songs but in the credits it says they're co-wtitten by her and professional song writers. Even Nsync does that. I would give Let Go zero stars but unfortunately amazon doesn't have that option."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can listen to it straight through","review":"I can't stand Avril's attitude but she definitely made a hit with this album. Ironically, this CD and it's songs seem to represent everything Avril claims to hate.Compiled of pop hits, this cd is a pleasure to listen to because you don't have to skip any of the songs. The lyrics are simple, but catchy, and there isn't too much of one instrument to drown out the others. Most of the songs sound the same but it's still enjoyable if you like her style.I would recommend it to anyone who likes mainstream music."},{"rating":"2","title":"INCREDIBLE","review":"This is the first CD i've ever bought that i can listen to, all day and never get bored of it, every song on the disk keeps getting better everytime i hear them, this beauty was born to rock!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only one good song","review":"This was such a disappointing album.

My husband and I listened all the way through and as soon as it was done we both laughed and said - sell it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS NOT PUNK","review":"lets take this slowley okay. first THIS: meaning this cd and avril. second, IS: state of being. 3rdly NOT: SIMPLY NOT having nothing to do with in any way. Lastly PUNK: punk, okay this is not punk, go look at punk in the punk section in your music store, this is not punk no way at all. I wouldn't mind it, if she classified herself as what she is, rock/pop. There i said it. I do not recomend this cd if you are under the impression that this is punk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"If i could i would rate this CD a 0 but since i cant itll get a 1. Ok, Avril Lavigne's music is flat, the lyrics are incredly dull, and lack a deeper meaning. Other bands and groups posses introperspective and reflective lyrics. Instead of Avril I would recommend: Ramones, Sex Pistols, The Clash, Buzzcocks, NoFx, Dropkick Murphys, Sublime, Reel Big Fish. If you're not into the harder 70s punk, OAR, Butch Walker, The Flaming Lips, and The Smiths are good choices. If you insist on sticking with pop at least pick some pop with class. Ryan Cabrera posses tolerable lyrics and very good guitar playing. C'mon..Honestly, would you listen to a song called Sk8ter Boi??"},{"rating":"1","title":"sry...avrils not punk","review":"When I first heard skater boy, I thought \\"this is a cool pop song\\". Then people were like \\"oh avril is so punk\\". No way! She cant play the guitar well, she thinks that she is a punk,when in reality she doesnt know a thing about it! And before she even became famous, she was a prep. She just wanted people to think she was unique and cool. She cant write a decent song. So, I suggest not buying this cd because it has like two good songs on it, which you could easily download. Dont waste your money on this cd, you will regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avril Lavine~Let GO","review":"In my opinion, this cd was the most odd thing I ever listened to. This young women is singing about problems that are effecting her life. I just don't see why she has to sing about that. Most of her songs are negative and include one of her worldly problems. Avril has a great voice, but she is definatly not using it in the right way. Just by looking at the cover, you can already tell that she is angry about something. Although many may in joy this, for me this cd was very digrceful indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Die Avril Die","review":"Look there are some really stupid people in this world like the people who say Avril writes her own stuff and is original *cough* Rolling Stone and every other music mag *cough* they are dumb and brainless. They seem like they are brain washed by MTV and pop mainstream. It seems like everyone who likes her is either 40 years old and like the Osmonds or is 12 years old and is too stupid for themselves. Personally I can't wait till 5 years from now when we can make fun of her on tv (with Gimp Trizkit and Fakey Spears). If you are going to by this album get the Velvet Underground and Nico album then listen to both and if you still like this album then slap yourself and say to your self \\" I have no musical taste I am a puppet I hate my life\\" and we all will be happier why you will be shunned."},{"rating":"1","title":"There should be piano","review":"This cd is the pits. Avril Lavigine used no piano on this album. The song I liked on the album was a slow one called, \\"Tomorrow\\". Personally, I am a better piano player who plays jazz musc instead of stupid pop-rock music. I should be playing in jazz clubs."},{"rating":"1","title":"her persona spoiled the music for me","review":"i'm not going to lie. she comes off as this punky chick, but once she opens her mouth i just want to smack her. this album promises but does not deliver. with what she says her influences are, you'd expect something hard, of the ramones at the most, of green day/blink 182 at the least. but this album has NOTHING to do with anything she is supposed to represent. it is not a punk album, it is not what her character portrays. it is exactly what she always speaks out against, pure pure pop with a tad bit mix of country in it. there is no quality in this album, it is another teeny bopper piece of crap. too much whining. i feel sorry i borrowed this album. my advice, preview it online, the static from the poor streaming does the songs more justice. why 2 stars? it is poppy and catchy, that's all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jealous?","review":"Well its cool to see so many jealous ppl writing bad comments on Avril. Humans who aren't jealous wouldn't leave such bad remarks about her instead would just not leave anything behind to even get associated with the person. Well Avril isn't god, but for starters, she has got it! Doesn't really matter whether she's really that good or not, I think in the entertainment industries, what makes you so great is ability to get ppl's attention both positive and negative, as long as you get to do that, you've done it cause that's entertainment. When nobody's talking bout you, that's dangerous! Every publicity is good publicity be it bad or good news bout them. After all, these types of publicities are free from the public, saves the record company millions of dollars in generating more news, when you talk about her with friends...bad or good, you make her come alive dudes!! Thumbs up to avril, she's hip!"},{"rating":"1","title":"GO BACK TO CANADA!!!","review":"This CD is PATHETIC!!! DO NOT WASTE UR TIME!!! The girl cannot sing, her music is corporate crap, and she is not PUNK, SKATER, OR WHATEVER SHE PROCLAIMS TO BE!!! Washed up is what I will expect in a year!!Canada has given us Alanis. A true singer songwriter!! Go Back To Canada Avril... and take your crap with you.Also.. I took the CD Back and traded it in for a new CD case for my car. My Niece got a better CD from me in return.. Kittie's album \\"Oracle\\". Every 17yr old should have it...lol"},{"rating":"2","title":"Some people are just too closed minded...","review":"Well, for starters, I would like to say that I really do not think that Avril Lavigne should be categorized as pop like many have stated. For one thing, she writes her own songs. She can actually play an instrument. She isn't a manufactured puppet made up by the music company. Avril Lavigne deserves to be well known and popular, because she is a very talented song writer and a wonderful musician. This is one of the only cds I have heard lately that I don't feel the need to skip ahead on the track list. The whole thing is very well done, and if you are open minded at all, you should hear this cd. I will also add that unlike a few other female \\"musicians\\" Avril does not need to strip off all of her clothes to make herself popular (ahem, Britney Spears), because her music is actually good enough to take her somewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Avril Lavigne ( Lah-Vine )","review":"Avril Lavigne - Vocals- Evan Taubenfeld -Guitars-Matthew Brann -Drums-Marck Spicoluk - Bass.Avril Lavigne is Gifted with a mature voice at the young age of 17, she tough herself to play guitar. Her music is a mix of pop rock and soft punk rock some might compare to Alanis Morisette. She write the lyric to her songs about her feelings. She is very Original and I would recommend this CD to those sick of Britney Spears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please read before you make your desion","review":"I'm tired of everybody writing reviews that are not the least bit helpful to anybody deciding to buy this cd. All it is is \\"I love Avril Lavinge!\\" or \\"I hate her, she is such a poser, you don't know what reall punk is!\\" becuase that isn't helpful at all. If you are a pop fan this cd would be a good buy for you. She doesn't write her own songs and she can't really play the guitar but just because of that, it doesn't mean you shouldn't buy her cd and like her music! The cd has some really good songs on it. It ranges from catchy high energy songs to slow ballads that you and friends will be singing along to in no time. And overall, it's a pretty great debut cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slayer Rules, Not This Garbage","review":"Avril Lavigne is no acception at all. She's not even punk, rock, or even hardcore. She's just a piece of MTV/pop bulls*** along with Pink, Madonna, Christina Aguilera, Alanis Morissette, Justin Timberlake, Nick Carter,Britney Spears, and any other crappy band I can think of. You want real music, listen to Slayer, Pantera, Rammstein, Kreator, Megadeth, Deicide, Metallica, Cannibal Corpse, Sepultura, Morbid Angel, Ministry, Nine Inch Nails, Suffocation, Obituary, Machine Head, King Diamond/Mercyful Fate, and Black Sabbath/Ozzy Osbourne."},{"rating":"1","title":"POOR","review":"this is some of the most disgraceful music i have ever heardi hate how these crap overrated bands get so much respect while no one recognises megadeth and iron maiden who have been producing good music for 20 years"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avril, you are too old to be doing this.","review":"I have listened to this CD all the way through and it is not that special. Hiccupy, unattractive girl voice with tiresome, bland acoustic guitars, screeching about how much life sucks.Now, not all the songs are horrible, but they could be more mature. If Avril got some singing lessons and changed her image, I just might like her a little more. But I'm sorry if I hurt other people's feelings, but she is WAY too old for that punk look. I wonder what she dresses like in real life. But come on she is twenty something years old and she is dressing like girls in my 6th grade class. Just drop the act, Avril. I'm not falling for the little charade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying too hard","review":"Okay. Maybe she has a mediocre voice, and some singing talent, but she is trying too hard to be something she's not. After all of her songs that were aired on TV, not ONE of them was actually punk, which is what she claims to be. I say, stick to what your good at, and don't TRY to be someone you're not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Singer","review":"I was totally blown away when I heard how this young woman can sing. My husband's a musician and he agrees that she really phenominal. Avril also wrote most of the songs on this CD, which equals a powerhouse of talent for someone who's only 20 years old. You will love this CD... her voice is mezmerizing."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Of The best Punk Albums Of All Time?","review":"Firstly Avril Lavigne has done a great job, lets face it, anyone who can do something completely un-natural to themselves, and earn millions is a genius.I understand she was a country and western singer before her producer told her, 'look the best way to earn millions is to become a completely fake bimbo with the wrong label, but the right audience', or something like that anyway, then she replied, 'no, I love my country singing, please, please,' then, 'Enough! You shall be a punk rock star who sings about skater boys, OK?', 'I suppose so,' I'm not sure if thats 100% accurate, but I heard it through the 'punk rock' grapevine. So, here we are, with yet another talentless person making WAY TOO MUCH MONEY.I swear I met her once in a moshpit at a Tool concert, oh no, maybe in a barn somewhere with her acoustic guitar, much more probable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ordinary and pretentious","review":"Avril brings to my mind the following words by Wolfgang A. Mozart: \\"The golden meam, the truth, is no longer recognized or valued. To win applause one must write stuff so simple that a coachman might sing it, or so incomprehensible that it pleases simply because no sensible man can comprehend it\\". As a great professor (Neuhaus?) once wrote, \\"Talent is passion plus intellect\\". You are cool, Avril, but how about a little visit to the Conservatory before even attempting to write your own music? Oh, I see, you are too cool to lose your time at school!"},{"rating":"2","title":"buy the damn thing","review":"it's a wicked cd full of heartfelt songs and a chick with attitude. like many of you out there i was unsure about buying this but afterward i was very pleased with it. definately the best this year (in my opinion). also take note this is not another grueling bubblegum pop cd...this is a little thing i like to call \\"music\\" not \\"bubblegum pop\\"..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Cd","review":"I like this cd because it has good pop/rock.

She sings songs that sound nothing like punk and now the MTV viewers think punk rock is \\"Sk8ter Boy\\". She calls herself the anti britney but she is Britney only I give Britney more respect because she doesn't think she a punk. The songs are pretty good but not punk. If you want to hear real punk try the sex pistols of ramones not avril."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap, pure crap","review":"When i first heard the song Complicated, i did not like it. That was enough for me. Then a kid in my bunk that summer blasted it over and over and over again. That is how I came to dispise the song. I agree with Floyfian's view that this one star review will not change most things since MTV and Z100 control the musical thoughts of the magority of todays youth. Hell they even had a hold on me once..........when I was 7 and didn't know better! All I will say is that if you are interseted in finding out what punk really is then please, I am begging you people, listen to The Ramones!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Sing, Can't Play, Can't Compose","review":"I kind of liked this album from the couple of songs I heard on the radio. Then I heard her trying to sing live, twice--once on MTV and another time on the Tonight Show. Both times she couldn't sing in tune. Man, she sang bad! And her guitar playing was comletely bogus. I play guitar myself and I could see that she didn't know jack (...) . She wasn't even playing the right chords for the songs she was trying to sing. Then I find out that she only wrote the lyrics for the songs, not the actual music. What a rip-off! Jeez, even Alanis Morisette writes her own songs and she can really sing too. But Avril Lavigne is a total phony. Who is promoting her so hard? She obviously isn't making it on her own talent, because she doesn't have any. How come Avril gets all this attention when there are a bunch of really talented people who can write, sing, and play their own stuff and sound good live too?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well we have to give it one star...","review":"Has anyone else out here wondered why there are 10 different versions of this cd? Do we know of anyone else that puts out that many versions of an album to make money? This is just another stereo-typical pop-punk record designed to sink your wallet in the toilet. The songs are uninspired and horrible. But, you can't blame Avril...seeing as how she wrote little to none of the music on here. I would even choose Blink-182 over here even with as bad as they suck. Don't waste your money on this cd...it is THAT bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"add water ...","review":"Equation for success in the music business:1. Identify age demographic of intended sales2.

Its true, despite how many times other fans like me come to her defense whenever someone says she's a poseur, I agree with whoever that person was. She was stretching the rock chick image a bit too far. I'm not saying she claimed she was a punk, but I'm saying she was trying to be someone she couldn't. But she pulled it off incredibly in her second album (another story).But still, this album is wonderfull, all acoustic guitar-drums feel-ey easy pop punk. The whole album is basically a lot of fun, Avril teases and shouts a lot on this album, but it doesn't get annoying once, that is, accounting ONLY to the songs on this album.I liked it, but its definitely not for intolerant people who already have a very bad image of Avril.B+"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Viewpoint from a real \\"sk8ter\\"","review":"I trust that all of the people under me are under the age of 13 because as I see it these people have the I.Q. equivalent of a puppy. As the title above me says, ironically, I skateboard. I love skateboarding and as the masses and their ignorant selves decide to flock to it for their own greedy uses, I get sick. People like Avril Lavigne should be tortured ala Abu Gharib style. Music has now been sunk to the point where stereotypes and sex sell. And what better way than using a young girl who is a \\"sk8ter punk\\". I applaud the Matrix for crafting pop songs for a puppet and showing the world that you don't need talent to make it big (also see most female popstars 80-04 i.e. Kylie Monogue). If you have any sense of pop music then listen to the Velvet Underground's Loaded, or the Flaming Lips to truly understand music with catchy riffs and good song writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"AVRIL ROCKS!","review":"This is a good album. She sings great. She is also very cute! You may make fun of me. I don't care. But the best tracks on here are: Complicated and Sk8er Boy. These songs are great. This album is great.So what are the hell are ya waitin' for? Go get it Now! It is very cheap at [store name]. So if you don't want to get it here, then get it at [store name].

Or else!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great debut for an emerging artist","review":"Though Sk8er Boi gets the most radio airtime, it may well be the weakest selection on the CD. Avril's true style, I think, comes out much better in other songs. People who buy the CD for Sk8er Boi will be disappointed, but there's no reason to be disappointed by this CD at all. If you give the other songs a chance, you'll see that they are much better than some people give them credit for. Avril's a talented musician, and I hope to hear more from her in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"...quit it with the \\"punk poser stuff\\" enough to just LISTEN to this CD... its good stuff. really. im not about to go and rate every song cuz enuf ppl hav dun that already but...there is a definate reason this CD has sold so many copies. its because its sooo...good. so give it a chance, i like it, its good stuff.

Unlike all the other singers out there, Avril is not pop. That's what I love about her!! And her voice is soo pretty. She has great songs that tell stories unlike a lot of the ... out there today. She's totally real and this CD is definitley worth getting. She's not afraid to be different, and she does it in such a way that she stands out (which is a good thing) from the rest!! Don't get me wrong, pop isn't bad, but it's really refreshing to hear new music from a genre taken over by mostly male. GO AVRIL!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Avril Lavigne. Let Go","review":"Very good cd. I really like Avril Lavigne cause she is punk(which I love) and pop(which I like). My favorite song on the cd is \\"Sk8er Boi\\"(#3), I can sing that song anytime. But I really like \\"Moblie\\"(#5). It has a good beat and has catchy lyrics at the same time. My least favorite song has to be \\"Losing Grip\\"(#1)I really don't like the words or the beat, but it is still okay. I would actually give the CD 4.75 stars just because \\"Losing Grip\\", but Amazon won't let me. I think it's a very good CD and if you heard \\"Complicated\\"(#2) on the radio or T.V., you would like some of the other songs too."},{"rating":"2","title":"She'll go far","review":"I absolutely love this album - from the beginning to the end, it's full of powerful lyrics with a kick.

It's an outstanding album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing!","review":"I like every song on this album. It's kinda like Pop music which I don't really care for that much, except it has a little more of a rockin' sound to it. Avril shows a wide range with her voice and her music."},{"rating":"1","title":"0 stars","review":"This is the most worst junk ever. You might like this only if you like Good Charlotte. Avril thinks she has the whole punk theme down but what she doesn't realize is that her music to pure bubblegum pop. I mean really, if you listen to Britney's \\"I'm not a girl, not yet a woman\\" and Hilary's \\"So-Yesterday\\" there wouldn't be a difference in the world between ALL of Avril's songs. Her CD is basically very boring, you could probably only listen to a few songs then get bored and switch to another CD! Don't let the media fool you like they did with Good Charlotte. Don't think just because Avril likes to smash expensive guitars that her music is punk because it's not anywhere near! If you're looking for something to bang your head to this would not be the CD! If you're looking for something country/pop like Shania Twain or something...this is the CD for you. Which may I add that Shania Twain was Avril's influence....and she said she was the next Sid Vicious....ha!"},{"rating":"1","title":"good god i ummmm","review":"Avril has got to be the most poser-iest person ive heard of, and i know she would be classified as pop (though she probably thinks she is death metal or *gasp* punk),but she cant even do the pop thing right. she needs to learn how to sing, have good music/lyrics to go along with it and stop bein' such a freakin' jerk...maybe i could sleep better if i covered this cd with bleach and acid....or use it as a defense weapon that i could throw at sad avril loving souls and hit them in the jugular with{i know poser-iest isnt a word}"},{"rating":"1","title":"She Should Have Quit While She Was Ahead","review":"That is all I have to say about Avril. Her career is obviously at death's door, even though she never deserved any fame whatsoever. That is the only good thing about her, which is really quite sad. But really, is it possible for her upcoming album to match the insane success of \\"Let Go\\"? Avril's target audience is growing up, one day they will be embarassed to say they were once a fan of hers. One thing does scare me though: when Avril's career has ended, who will be taking her place? That really is a scary thought. If you like this album, I'd suggest listening to some other, better artists, and you will forget this little notalent ever existed (even that new Courtney Love album is better than this!). And for those of you who have never heard Avril (probably few), steer clear of this atrocity!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It couldbe so mutch better","review":"OK, I will admit their are a few songs that are good but the most of it is just her singing about what every other pop singer before her sang about.

She has possibility and determination but she needs to find her voice and start singing about real issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cd","review":"I like the CD but it isn't my favorite. I usually like more rock, pop-punk, alternative or that kinda stuff , but I like this Cd anyway. I persnally liked the second album more which is pop/rock ad I would recommend this to you if you like more pop, but if you tend to be more rock like me i would say listen to Under my skin. I especially like the songs Complicated, Anything but Ordinary, My World, Things I'll never Say and Nobody's fool. She write great lyrics, is talented and has a good voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anything But Ordinary","review":"Anything But Ordinary would sum up the sound that Avril gives out on her debut cd Let Go. It is really refreshing to listen to her music because it has all these different feelings expressed through her music and it is one of those cds where you just don't skip songs because they're all so good. If you really listen carefully you can feel what she was feeling whe she wrote that song and I myself find it comforting to know that other people like her have experienced the same things as me such as the song Things I'll Never Say. I can really relate to a lot of her songs on the album if not all of them. I would recommend this album to male and female alike, any person looking for a kick a** new sound with style and heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"An inspiring cd!!","review":"Avril Lavigne's cd \\"Let Go\\" is a great inspiring cd. The lyrics show feeling and are based on real life situations. The sound of her voice and the background music captures you! All of the songs are great. Sk8er Boi has a really good story line behind it. The cd is also enhanced and there are good videos on it. Avril is a great musician!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Avril Rocks","review":"First off all Canadian artists are good. Secondly all girl artists are awsome. Ecspecially the ones who write their own music and play an instrument. And lastly you gotta love girls who are bold enough to wear what they want and don't care about what other people think.

So buy her debut CD Let Go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't \\"Let Go\\" this One","review":"Let Go is one of the most moving albums I have ever listened to.

She's just a whiny brat in her daddy's clothes. If you want real punk or something like it, Courtney Love will serve just fine. She does not have a hard edge to her voice at all. She sounds like an Alanis Morrisette clone. She whines incessantly in Losing Grip and I'm With You. Then she pretends that she's tough stuff while singing in a little girl voice in Skater Boi and Complicated. There is no edge to her voice at all. She is a total phony. This is not punk.

I have been to doctors who are harsh and cold, and you leave feeling sicker than when you went in. This is a very balanced approach. I am very glad that I purchased this book.

It made me feel like I had to chew my shake!I just want the FLAVOR of cookie dough, not chunks of UFs (Unidentified Foods).I have included photos of the packet back so folks can see the vitamin content.That part is great, but I couldn't get this one down.Spiru-tein missed the boat on this one. It could have been one of thebest ones out there, but instead, it is just a bad texture andso-so taste.

The main reason I gave it a spin recently was all the rave reviews I read on the Net and had to have another listen in case I missed something. Nope, can't get into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swim Platform","review":"This is an outstanding swim platform. It was easy to mount on my 16.5 ft Lowe fishing machine.

You have to get it becasue Ryan Goldberg is te best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for traveling parents","review":"I recently started doing research on remote interaction with young children and have been looking for literature that can help me understand what it is like to be a traveling parent (I am not even a parent). I tried several books, but it was not until I stumbled upon Charlie Hudson's book that I found what I was looking for. Mrs Hudson not only explains everything very thoroughly and clearly, she backs everything up with literature references, own or other's real-life experiences. She also divides the book into age-chapters, knowing that a 3-year-old is very different to a 12-year-old. The book is easy to read, but still feels very thorough and reliable.I simply love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very sensible and enlightening account of a 4 year old","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It offered so many insights to my 4 year old's behavior and gave very sensible and practicle advice about how to deal with specific situations. The authors truly understand what it's like to parent a 4 year old!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I found this book to be old-fashioned and uninformative","review":"I read this book to get better insights into my own 4-year-old son, but I was very disappointed. It is full of gross generalizations, without many caveats that not all 4-year-olds are alike. I took a few pieces of information away from the book (which is why I gave it 2 stars), but for the most part, I found the content to be out of date and preachy. She also uses \\"he\\" and \\"him\\" exclusively, which, although I do have a son, I found difficult to ignore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wild three year old","review":"I was having issues with my 3 year old and the book seemed to have a good insite into ways of combating the problems I was encountering. I would recommend this book to those with wild three and a half year olds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Combination of Strange Ideas and Helpful Information","review":"While this book provides some nformation, it also makes some strange statements. Among other things, the book states that 1.Fours years olds should watch TV. 2. While it's ok for kids to be interested in letters and numbers, you should keep the information to yourself and not tell family or friends about it. 3.Kid's mental and physical abilities are determined in large part by their body shape. 4.It's better for kids to go to day care than to spend time with their parents. I didn't find this book to be particularly useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Your Four-Year Old: Wild and Wonderful","review":"This series of books is excellent. Each chronological year of child development is covered succinctly and in such a way that regardless of the educational level, it is understandable. The authors are quick to point out, that although developmental stages occur around a certain chronological age, your child is an individual and therefore, may not always fit neatly into the guidelines presented. However, it does give the stressed parent, a guideline of \\"normalcy\\" and practical tips to deal with difficult behaviors."},{"rating":"1","title":"outdated, outmoded","review":"This book is outdated in its viewpoints, and probably in its advice as well. All references are to \\"the mother\\" (and many observations re: moms are negative). The \\"toileting\\" section was especially scary.

I think that The Backstreet Boys really put their hearts and souls into this album. This is the best album they have put out in their career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Comeback","review":"This CD is awsome. Even though this CD is influenced by a lot of rock music, you can still hear the typical Backstreet Boys sound.From my point of view the songs all have a lot of meaning and emotions in them. Especially \\"Never gone\\", which is dedicated to Kevin's Dad.I can't decide yet which song is my favorite, because they are all great. But I think this CD makes the perfect comeback. They couldn't have done better."},{"rating":"1","title":"BACKSTREET BOYS WILL ALWAYS HAVE A PLACE IN MY HATE FOR BOY BANDS","review":"The Backstreet Boy's should have stayed in the minds and fantasies of the 11 year old girls who screamed there lungs out at the TV when they saw them. I don't know how people can waste their money on purchasing a CD of a bunch no talent individuals who don't even put in the time to write their own songs. I remember the living HELL they put guys through when that was the only thing that you could listen to on the radio(unless you put on the classic rock station)or watch on TV. I\\"m sure that when they were finally gone, parent's took pride in saying to their daughters\\"They're dead you know.\\" . I recomend this CD to anybody who's a complete idiot."},{"rating":"1","title":"BSB SUCKS!","review":"I have not listened to this album yet, but I don't like these guys anyway. I think that they SUCK! I must say that System of a Down, Green Day, and Slipknot are ten times better than these guys. This album shouldn't be called \\" Never Gone\\", it should be called, \\" Better off Gone\\". One more thing, your not a band unless you play an instrument!"},{"rating":"1","title":"so now they're rockers eh?","review":"I can't stand pop artists who try to be rock and call themselve punk.

It's got a little something for everyone.PINK FLOYD DARKSIDE OF THE MOON... This one too. Lots of chicks and gay guys. It's awesome while rolling on ecstasy.THE DOORS 1st album... Don't tell me that Jim Morrison doesn't melt your butter.COME ON NOW!

Since 2000, the Boys have matured and so has their sound. I know I am not the first to say it, but the results are incredible. The fans who have always been with BSB will appreciate the same old harmonies updated and revised, and new fans will fall in love with the makeover the Boys have given to pop. It's smart, it's fresh, it's strong, and it's real. Pick up \\"Never Gone\\" and take a listen. You'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music scene has talent again!!","review":"The new BSB album Never Gone is great! The vocals are stronger, the songs and lyrics are more intense, but they've still got the Backstreet sound as well. This album does not disappoint-I've already listened to it 3 times through and I am still not bored with it.Their talent is eternal. They remain one of the only groups/artists that can and will sing a cappella \\"at the drop of a dime\\":THAT shows true talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD in years!!","review":"The CD is truly one of a kind! The boys are back anfd sound better than ever! The songs are classic pop but have a mature sound, perfect for long time fans.

All the songs are really good. My mom even likes the new CD and she never did care much for them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Climbing The Walls, I Still...Lose It All","review":"A surprisingly refreshing album, the Backstreet Boys are back with possibly their strongest compilation of music yet.The album is refreshing in the sense that they have not changed their style to adhere to today's Rap and Hip Hop world. In many ways, they have fallen back on their original formula, though there is something extra in this album, as if they have created a new dimension to their former sound.Highlights are many, but 'Siberia' is probably the strongest melodically and possibly lyrically.The 3 bonus tracks in other versions of this release are average at best, so customers are not missing out much with the buy here.A must have album for any Backstreet Boys fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful","review":"This album is completely amazing. Much better than the tragedy that was Black and Blue. It't not sugary like some of the older songs. The sound of the album is more mature and the music is gorgeous. For the first time I actually like every song on a CD. Definitely get this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOOO glad to have Backstreet Back!","review":"The new album is great. Didn't realize how much I missed listening to these guys. They've definitely updated their sounds, but their voices sound as good as ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Gone yet better than ever","review":"The new cd Never Gone, has clearly shown how much the Backstreet Boys, or should I say Backstreet Men have grown up. Their poppy tunes from their earlier years have softened and have become more powerful showing a different side. Their first song, Incomplete, which happens to be their first single, automatically shows their maturity from these past four years. Although their music has matured, they have still kept a little of their old poppy Backstreet spirit like My Beautiful Woman. This cd can relate more with older fans, and also with the fans who have grown up listening to the Backstreet Boys. We have all matured much like the music. This cd is definitely their best one out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Backstreet Boys Never Disappoint","review":"Backstreet boys have done it again - They Never disappoint me. The direction they have taken with this album is new and refreshing but still remains true to the backstreet boys' style.The songs are unique,strong and heartfelt really showing off their creativity and amazing talent. I would highly recommend this CD to anyone whether you're a Backstreet fan or not this CD really opens itself up to appeal to a new crowd as well as remind the fans why we love the Backstreet Boys."},{"rating":"2","title":"They're back","review":"Backstreet's finally back.

Climbing The Walls, Incomplete, I Still, Lose It All, and Safest Place To Hide are what the band does best - ballads while Crawling Back To You and Just Want You To Know are the spunk of the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Acomplishment !!","review":"This by far the best cd the Backstreeet Boys have ever put out.More mature sound, shows the guys have grown with their fans.They have also made new fans with this one.Hard to pick one favorite off the album.Its rare I get a cd that I don't skip tracks on.You can't help but listen to the whole cd over and over.WELL DONE INDEED!! TRACY"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of BSB to date","review":"This just might be my favorite BSB cd of all time. I knew I liked their new sound with the release of Incomplete and couldn't wait to hear their new cd. It's everything you could ask for and more and I recommend it to all BSB fans. And for the person who gave this 1 star for not being able to play it on your computer...I don't know what kind of 80's technology you have but I was able to play it on my computer immediately! For those of us in 2005, this is an excellent come back for the boys, please DO NOT let that person's comments stop you from making a worthwhile purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"I absolutely love Never Gone. It's a great comeback album. The Boys have changed their style a bit (I guess they can't be singing Larger Than Life forever). The new Backstreet is more rock which fits in to the type of music today. I really like it. There is still a touch of the old Backstreet in songs like \\"I Still\\" and \\"Crawling Back To You\\". Most fans will be very pleased with the album. The dvd is awesome too. It shows the Incomplete video and great behind the scenes footage. This is a must have for all Backstreet fans. AWESOME! AWESOME!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice BSB!!!","review":"Having gone from being stricly a Bubblegum Pop & TLC nerd to a very ecliptict music listener....[12-19 now]This is my favorite pop cd in 6 years... It's not 'oh my god great' or 'oh my ears terrible'. It is in the middle. And nobody between 18-30 should be embarressed to owning this. Because you CAN be one of the people who went from 'teenybopper' to heavymetal, or to clubber...and still enjoy this album.If your someone who can listen to Kelly Clarkson there is no reason you cant listen to this album. (that's not an insult btw).... I have to say also, This is the group that has matured CORRECTLY. Critics,Random Ex-Fans can say whatever but.. Their new sound does not require them to \\"sex it up\\". Which is much more embarressing to music then admiting you like BSB again.I recommend this cd for old BSB fans and current pop fans. Possibly some soft-rock and country fans will like this also...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Backstreets Back... Why?","review":"Didn't the boy band fad die years ago? I mean come on if their so good at singing why don't they all be lead singers for rock bands.

They can crawl back into the hole where they've been hiding all these years and stay there.I'm not just saying this because I'm a guy and hate BSB, I'm saying this because their music is really terrible.

My fav song would have to be \\"Crawling Back to You\\". Its jus got so much emotion in it. I would love to go to their upcoming concert tho.. but i'm also kinda questioning if 300 bucks is well worth it to see em close enough so they dun like like the size of peanuts. Thats 27 hrs worth of work for me... i dunno if its worth it... esp if they wont notice me out of their 50 million fans. =P"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Like Every Other CD Out Today","review":"This CD is very unoriginal.

The growth of the music, the production, and their voices themselves are definite and shown with this new album. I love all of the songs, so full of passion, art, feeling.

They havent been around like for the last five years, and when I bought that CD I realized that the wait was worthy. Their vocal characteristic is still there. The nice thing is that they kept their style, but they are more mature. They work on their vocals instead on those mechanic sounds that many bands use now. Im sure that if you hear them on the CD you will hear the same on live.This CD is totally a good buy, because the lyrics are more complete than ever and you can really feel identified with them.I totally recommend listening to the songs: Siberia, Poster Girl, Never Gone, Just want you to know."},{"rating":"2","title":"A definate shift","review":"\\"Never Gone\\" is definately a shift from the sugar, pop earlier sounds of the Backstreet Boys.

There really are no dance tunes here but several ballads, so if you miss the smooth, soothing, melodic sounds of the boys do pick this cd up just know it's not as good as their previous stuff but it's not bad. Forget the loser Rockers who are constantly trying to put BSB down. I listened to Metallic, Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath pure crap. Rockers don't waste your time listening to BSB your brain cells can't handle tastfully done music."},{"rating":"2","title":"EL NUEVO ESTILO DE LOS CHICOS DE ORLANDO","review":"Este cd es una gran sorpresa para todos los fans de los backstreet boys... luego de su larga ausencia regresan al mundo musical con NEVER GONE una producci��n que si bien es cierto no es tan extraordinaria como otros materiales del grupo, pero que convence a la mayor��a de fan��ticos en los cuales me incluyo... su pop suave y juvenil cambia dr��sticamente con un intento de pop rock estilo Take That incluso se escuchan muchos metales similares a Bon Jovi... sugiero a todos los compradores amantes del pop a adquirir este cd y tambien a los fans de los backstreet boys para \\"Keeping the backstreet pride alive\\" pero no lo recomiendo para aquellos que no aprecien el pop."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than worth the wait","review":"\\"Never Gone\\" is amazing! It's got the same wonderful harmonies and catchyness of the BSB of old but with an organic feel. It definately reflects growth and maturity without losing any of the original magic that the Boys were so good at creating. A must have for any BSB fan or any one who enjoys 5 part harmonies."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Never Gone\\"","review":"Wow...a long awaited ablum...they have matured so much since the last ablum...the songs are so awesome...KTBSPA"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best thing to come out of music for a while!","review":"Wow!

The 5 long year wait was worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Backstreet Boys are Never Gone","review":"This album is possibly the greatest album The Backstreet Boys have produced yet! All of the songs are super! Never Gone the title track of the CD was written by Kevin Richardson and as you listen to it you can tell that there is a story behind this song. The CD is great and I would recommend it to anyone...especially Backstreet fans who have been there since the beginning."},{"rating":"2","title":"The amazing shift of the Backstreetboys","review":"Attention all fans of the Backstreetboys this album will blow you away. Haters of the Backstreetboys, this album will blow you away. The new album Never Gone is an amazing album with pop, hiphop, rock and alternative influences that cannot be ignored. It is not your typical Backstreetboy album and there is actually no sugary bubble gum pop in it. Its hard core in a good way. The singing is on key and it will make you cry, bop your head, dance, and think about life. It is an album that will change your life forever and you will be a better person for listening to it. I highly recommend this cd to anyone no matter whats your prefered type of music. Do not judge the Backstreetboys by previous albums as this one stands up on its own. It is unmistakingly perfect and the best album of theirs to date. Do not be embarrassed to buy this album as it is an original masterpiece. Everyone buy it now!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great products with always fast deliverly.","review":"I have ordered alot from Amazon.com and have always received fast and excellent service with great buys and great cd's.

They have come a long way from the days of sugar pop and the boy-band 'mold'. The album musical content ranges from slow, rap, to rock, and believe me, you will be singing along out loud and in your head for a long time to come!! It is awesome!! Great job 'Boys'! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's about time!","review":"I know with all the drama and time spent doing their own things, it was a rough road for The Boys to tread. But they are finally back! And with an incredible new CD out!This CD is above and beyond from the first track - and what first track it is. \\"Incomplete\\" is a rock ballad made for the desperate broken-hearted. One of my favorite tracks. Also, \\"I still...\\" is nothing to scoff at. A call for the one that got away to come back. Another of my favorite tracks. I've recently taken a gander at the new video for \\"I Just Want You to Know\\" and nearly died laughing. It has become one of my favorite music videos and I suggest everyone check it out! Finally the boys are flashing their humor to more than just the \\"true fans\\" who watch the tour/backstage videos and interviews.Boys, if you read this, I love the album and keep up the good work! Oh, and welcome back. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome....","review":"I trully love some of the songs on this album.I specially love the slow songs, and altho Poster Girl and Weird World have stepped out of the regular BSB songs I have learned to appreciate.Never Gone is greatttt! and makes a good title for the CD.You hear the more mature voices and insight of the guys!I strongly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best BSB Album Ever!","review":"The Backstreet Boys have always been good, but this album is a chance for devoted fans and new fans alike to come together to appreciate this quintet's talent. The new, softer sound is just a feel good album. The songs also sound a lot more thought provoking than their other albums, exhibiting their maturity. This is the Boys at their absolute best! As a fan of nine years, I have to say that \\"Never Gone\\" is a sure hit for listeners old and young."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome!","review":"the new backstreet boy album is awesome. all the songs are great... no bad ones.

The guys sound wonderful. I love each and every song on the album. 'Climbing the Walls' and 'Crawling back to You' tears at your heart. 'Weird World' keeps playing on and on in your head. 'Safest Place to Hide' is sung so beautifully you want to pull your honey close. And 'Beautiful Women' makes you want to go driving downtown with Nick by your side. Thank you guys for the song 'Never Gone' it is perfect for those who have lost a loved one. I eternally dedicate it to my granparents. I cannot say which song I like the best. I have listened to the album so many times I know all the words. I have one in the car, one at work, and one at home. The Backstreet Boys have proven to me again they ARE THE BEST GROUP IN THE WORLD and will never be gone. I cannot wait for the next album."},{"rating":"1","title":"This cd contains spyware","review":"Do not put into your computerhttp://news.yahoo.com/s/usatoday/20051110/tc_usatoday/somesonycdspiracyprotectioncalledspywarehttp://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20051110/wr_nm/sony_hack_dc"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get over it","review":"Seriously. The Boyband jokes are old, old, and old. I'm a 27 year old guy who listens to the BSB because they make good music. \\"Incomplete\\" reminds us just who the Backstreet Boys are. \\"Crawling back to you \\" is probably one of the most emotional and beautiful songs from the guys in a while. That track is my pick for favorite on this album. You can hear the maturity in this album...well, Nick sounds pretty much the same since Millenium, but i'm not knocking the guy. I would have liked to hear a bit more from Kevin Richardson. Overall, I think BSB has done it again, this time with a different twist and I enjoy every minute of it. Pick up this album now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is brilliance.","review":"I don't understand how anyone couldn't fall in love with this album. I actually stopped listening to their older material because I was sick of all the sicky pop stuff and I'm into rock more now. So when I heard \\"Incomplete\\" for the first time I was sooo thankful that they'd grown up. The entire album just makes me want to dance from begining to end. It's awesome. They've grown up. It's definetly different than their older material. Compare \\"We've got it goin' on\\" from their selt-titled album to \\"Climbing the walls\\" from this album. Huge difference man, huge difference. I'm not saying all of us should think the same way when it comes to music, but some things are just obvious. This album is brilliance."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Guys are Back","review":"The Kings of power ballads are back and they have not disappointed thier fans. Not only will BSB fans not be disappointed but anyone curious about BSB would do themselves a favor to just listen to this cd. The passion and emotions with which they sing are unreal. I don't believe they have shown this kind of intensity on any of their past cd's. The beautiful melodies sung with such fierce passion and emotion pierces your soul. Although they have ventured into the pop-rock realm, their signature trademark harmonies have not been sacarficed. Their sound has matured along with thier fan base. The harmonies are tight, the emotions are raw, the singing is intense a perfect comeback cd. My favorite songs on the cd are Safest Place to Hide, Never Gone, Siberia,I Still,Weird World, actually ...I think maybe I just like them all. Welcome back BSB, and thank you for bringing good music back."},{"rating":"2","title":"BACKSTREET'S BACK ALRIGHT!!","review":"The boys (actually more like men) are back and they are better than ever with the best studio album they have released in their career.

My favorite song is \\"crawling back to you\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A Stellar Comeback for BSB!","review":"Backstreet Boys' latest release \\"Never Gone\\" is classic Backstreet with a slightly updated sound. It is full of great songs that will have you playing them over and over again! By now I'm sure you have heard the first single \\"Incomplete\\" What a great way to start off the CD with a beautiful ballad.While this CD lacks a lot of the up-tempo songs their previous albums had---I was expecting a rockier sound, but most of the songs are very pretty and the album flows really well. Standout tracks include 'Climbing the Walls' a beautiful and emotional song, and 'Siberia,' which is a really pretty ballad and puts you in a romantic mood.This CD is destined to be one of the top albums of the year!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"I was very disappointed in this CD, it doesn't have the same great sound of their old stuff!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Buying","review":"I was very disappointed in this CD.

I was definately a big BSB fan during their first era and I do love the songs on this new cd.HOWEVER. and this is a pretty large however. They have tried some kind of copyright-copyproof thing on this cd that I have yet to ever come across. And this protection prevents me from uploading the cd on my computer. I figure their logic is that if you can't get the cd on your computer you can't make a copy. But I don't want to make a copy. I WANT TO PUT IT ON MY IPOD. How stupid is it to make a cd that you, essentially, can't listen to. I don't even own a cd player. I put all cd's on my computer and then upload them onto my ipod and plug speakers into my ipod.

What made these boys [men] so irresistible before were their inherent urges to bestow beauty on the landscape. \`Millennium' was a teen near-classic based on 4 of the first 5 cuts alone, with their ethereal vocal flourishes wafting you toward reverie signifying nothing but pulchritude. Here, the gasping of the voices, the pomposity of each trying to out sing the other, and the song selection prove this to be a fatal error in judgment. What could have been a growing up process morphed into the 3rd coming of New Kids On the Block. Max Martin, where are you?

I have been a bsb fan for a long 8 years now and the cd itself is truly not disappointing repeat, NOT DISAPPOINTING. The new songs they wrote on this cd is great and they took a daring risk in putting the song \\"incomplete\\" ( a great ballad of course) as the first single.

If you dont believe me, click above where it says \\"1 star\\" for Reviews and you will see many others saying the same thing (maybe not CD getting f***ed up, but about the copywrite thing).

Don't get me wrong, Black and Blue harbored some good tracks but this is definitely the direction they should have headed in in the first place for longeviety's sake.

It was bad enough putting up with the Backstreet Boys and their sugary lovesick ballads in the 90s, why bring it back now? No offense to you BSB fans, but the Backstreet Boys really were an awful group. None of them had listenable voices, and their love ballads were so sweet and sugery it made me sick.

I was 16 when they first came out, so I figured I had to continue fan loyalty & pick up this CD, today. Listened to it at the office at work. Now that I'm 24, I really feel like they grew up right along with me(which obviously they did). It's an interesting dynamic to realize. They still sound like classic BSB, but there is definitely a more mature feel all around. My personal favorites are \\"Wierd World\\" and \\"Poster Girl\\" I'm not sure if it will resonate with the younger audience, but for anyone in their 20's it does have a lot of great lyrics that you can relate to."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy, more-Mature Sound. Worth buying, great as a gift for a girl","review":"THe boys have grown up, and it shows in this album. They are more polished and put themselves in the hands of some of the most admirable producers in the pop music biz.The album, as a whole, does not really build because it is practically one ballad after another however, do not let that discourage you from giving the new Back Street Boys a shot. If you thought they were to tongue and cheek before, most probably this record will convince you they are worth new consideration.I hope they build upon this album and produce more grown up music. It would be good if they crank out some danceable tracks with the same approach as this album.

This watch serves that purpose. It has several other features that I don't use such as the lap timer or the alarms. The watch says 'unisex' but I think it would look small on a man's arm. It was easy to figure out how to set without opening the manual. The large display is nice, and I like the band, because it's rubber, and because the excess is held in place and doesn't (annoyingly) flap against my wrist. I have had it about 3 weeks, so I can't attest to battery life or how the band holds up over time, but based on my experience thus far, I would buy the same watch again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never without my watch!","review":"I bought this to replace my older Timex Ironman watch since the plastic piece that held the band down split in two places. I tried super glue but it wasn't sturdy enough for me.I love this watch for running as well as school/work (nursing). The second counter as well as the date and weekday make my life much easier. It has an option to beep once every hour, and I like that for when I'm busy cleaning or studying and it helps keep me on track.I can swim and shower with it on without any problem - that way I don't have to take it off since I have a habit of misplacing or downright forgetting accessories in my busy schedule. I wasn't sure about the band compared to my older one (that one had the large holes in band) because I was afraid it would make my wrist sweat. I usually just leave it a tiny bit loose and I have no problems.Overall, I love this watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good blend of quality, features, and value","review":"I wear this watch all day (work, play, gym, etc.) The size is nice, small yet easy to read. I don't like the bulky alternatives. Getting watch, chrono, countdown timer, several alarms, and 100m waterproof for $35 is a good deal for me. The Indiglo lighting numbers on a dark background is different in a good way.My one complaint is about the wrist band, for which I admittedly have a thing. My last watch had nylon/leather which stayed wet and smelled funky after a while. I do like the rubber material used for this watches band. However, the loop that holds the band after the buckle is not reliable. It moves around and often leaves the band flapping around. A minor issue, but being active I hate loose straps flapping around. I've had the watch just over a year and have had no failures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!

I disliked some things about this book. Primarily, that the author threw a ton of stuff against the wall, to see how much of it would stick. In doing so, some does, and a lot doesn't. Therein lies the problem: making accusations which lack substantiation or a volume of compelling circumstantial evidence, helps rather than hinders the Clintons. The book relies too much on rumor and innuendo to truly succeed. I have gained much better information and enjoyment from the Slick Willie books, the Year of the Rat book, Dave Marrannis First In His Class, No Surprises, and even The Clinton Chronicles book. The book's redeeming value is that you will read some things you probably haven't before, and a few of them have credible facts and evidence. These are in the minority, however."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential","review":"This book is a great place to start looking at the issues raised today by post-modernism. An eye-opening read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A helpful text with open interpretation","review":"I read this book for my Theological Ethics class. David Wells' approach to understanding our postmodern culture in light of the church is unique and thought-provoking. Rather integrate his critique with Biblical doctrine, he gives over 180 pages of contemporary critique of culture from the perspective of psychology, technology, consumerism, politics, and notions of guilt, and shame. Only in his introduction and concluding chapter does he address our cultural ideas with the Biblical norm. Its a laborious way to approach the topic but bears his intended fruit. His opinion of the move from community to self may be simplistic but accurate. This text is useful for anyone considering ethical decision-making in our postmodern society."},{"rating":"2","title":"Literary war novel - good and bad","review":"The good parts of this book raise it well above the rabble, but come up a little short of perfection. Arvin is a marvelous writer, his style is intelligent and colorful and, to me, brings to mind a little of Cormac McCarthy. The protagonist, Heck, is well described and realistically motivated. He's an outsider, which is a bit of a cliche in these kind of stories, but a believable one and sympathetically drawn.Arvin does follow in well trodden literary footsteps, though, with his theme. I won't give away plot details, but the soldier Heck takes an action that reverberates heavily and, I thought, a little too predictably at the end. This gives the book a bit of a teenage \\"struggle with conscience\\" theme reminescent of many coming of age books already written.Still I recommend it for the quality of writing and ideas presented."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this cam instead; the TRV950 is a total waste.","review":"I've been using the MX5000 (the Japanese version of the DV953)over a year, and I can assure you that this cam is a huge bargain. You can get one for $1100 or less (even cheaper than the 1CCD TRV80), and you know what? This cam incorporates the 3CCD technology that are widely used in professional video cameras today. Another great thing about this cam is the Leica lens that has special multiple coatings, and the Zeiss lenses in Sony cams are a joke in comparison. Buy this cam instead of the TRV70, 80, 950; by doing that, you'll save more money.*The Good Things about the DV953-\\"optical\\" image stabilizer-auto (not manual) ND filter-great color reproduction (sometimes better than the TRV950)-much more flexible, intuitive manual controls compared to the TRV950-high resolution: 540 lines-manual iris & shutter control-much better audio than that from any Sony cam (TRV70, 80, etc...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera/Lousy Manual/Software","review":"I recently purchased this camera from a company in New York for less than 1600 US. The deal included shipping and a ton of extras (pro pack it was called). Anyhow, aside from the lousy manual and useless software, the camera is fantastic. The video quality is stunning to say the least and the digital stills I am taking are impressive. As for the manual, I quickly remedied this by going online and hunting down reviews for the camera (DVD-Spot had the best/most thorough). I am still working on software for converting my home movies to dvd, but I will get that accomplished over time.

With the promise of USB and VGA-quality, this camera seemed like a sure thing. And when it came, I discovered features that I never expected, like a self-timer and a tripod mount.Alas, the pictures are terrible. First off, the camera is only useful in bright light (forget any kind of indoor shot unless you can stand a very dark, red-tinged image -- which rules out webcam use); and no shot that we tried quite came in focus. Moreover, the software to transfer is awkward; the USB does not support mass storage (where the camera appears as another disk drive), instead you use the supplied program to manually download.As much as I and my nine-year-old son wanted to like this camera, it has serious flaws and it's not worth even its rock-bottom price."},{"rating":"2","title":"ND8 Filter","review":"A very strong Contrasting Filter.

The only reason for giving it four stars instead of five was the fact that I got the impression that the female mindset was not familar ground for Mr. Johnson.

His style is humorous, easy going and very readible. Although I am sure this book is now slightly out of date, rest assured it is a great travel reference and a firm background in some of the greatest names in beer. I used this book extensively while on active duty and it has listings for ALMOST all the 50 states. From New Mexico to Maine and beyond I have visited brewpubs and breweries in about 41 states. Don't go on vacation with out this definitive guide to beer. Combine it with a current beer guide, and you will have the most accurate and up to date reference for great beer in the United States. Highly recomended!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"um yah","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this laid back alternative band while studying in Italy. The voice of the lead singer parallels the band's constant wave of relaxing 4 chords while sometimes banging a Smashing Pumpkinsesque kick to it. This group dislpays focus with its ever-illusive lyrics and blended in voice to guitar corrolation, and also carries a father like sense of maturity by not succumbing to the cliche' chorus, which says \\"band above all.\\" And recommended by its rock and musical message which seems to whisper to me \\"Let's slow the whole world down,\\" is always better mixed with a bottle of Chianti and cuban."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful easy to use camera kit","review":"I found this set up easy to install and use. It uses regular telephone cable which can extend the range of the camera from the TV. The picture is good during the day from near or far but at night only the close up is recognizable. I found it to be a great value and a good piece of mind to know my home is protected.

Several months down the line I took the camera out to make sure what kind of card I needed to purchase for taking still photos. When I turned it on and tried to use it, I got the recording of sounds in the room but no picture. Now keep in mind I thought that I was maybe looking at the lens cap, but it was no longer covering the lens. I adjusted everything pertaining to the darkness of the screen and was still unable to get anything other than a black screen on the LCD or through the view finder.

From soup to nuts the Sony product is much better. Do a simple compare and you will find that the Panasonic camcorder does not have half the technology or enhancements. If you are looking at spending 700+ dollars on something to record your families memories, I would consider spending an extra $200 for something that is going to give you pleasure throughout the years. Also, Sony has many add-on products (Lens, Tripod, Filters etc.) that are handy!My only advice is that if you are going to spend this much money, either wait until you can afford a real product or buy the right product first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea, but need great improvements","review":"Great idea, but not very functional.

It works fine as long as I remember to stop it before 55 minutes, but losing everything seems like an awfully big price to pay for losing track of the time. I've called customer support and they say it shouldn't do this and they don't know why it does, and there's nothing to be done about it since it's not under warranty anymore. (They'll fix it for $300 + parts, but I'm reluctant to pour more money into this piece of junk.)

The camera is really easy to use, but you need a Master's degree in computer programing to get the software to work. I have had little success in getting the usb connection to work. Still after struggling with this thing for over a year I discovered that you can use the dvd ram in a drive eliminating the need of the usb. A prior review suggests that you have to load the dvdram driver to make the transfer to the computer easier. In the configure menu you have to tell the software to read the disc in your dvdrom drive. The transfer is still slower then XMAS, but at least I don't have to pray to the electronic's gods to get my videos transferred. One last thing, the manual for the software is completely useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"Well done mystery that keeps you guessing. Great for Cumberbatch fans.

Technology has long passed the point where the events of this tale have come true. Powerful media giants determine the \\"news\\" which is really propaganda. \\"My country--right or wrong\\" only makes this reality more concrete. Individual human beings, their loves, and their lives of giving to others in selfless service mean nothing to the monster of government/corporations in collusion. This is today... this is reality.

I got this for Christmas for my 5 year old daughter; she takes dance, likes dancing, has never had or known about another 'Dance Dance Revolution' game, and she LOVES IT. It's a big hit; she's jumping all over the place, adds up her score at the end of each song, and it's been a great, cheap gift, with exercise to boot.No, it's not sophisticated. Older kids or teens (not to mention adults) would grimace in pain over the ancient graphics and lousy sound. For them, get one that goes in their PlayStation or whatever.However, many 5 year old girls don't have a PlayStation, or need one. This is perfect for them.

Imagine a dance pad game for Atari. Then imagine it is the worst possible Atari game you have ever seen, and that would be a close description of this game. There are 50 computer generated \\"beeping\\" monphonic sounds that irritate more than energize you. The rythem and the timing is off on all the songs, and the dance pad is very poor quality.

Sheaks gives a more unbiased point of view, much closer to the truth than most authors.There are not step by step demos of projects, but rather things for you to study. This book can definitely inspire ideas, but will not hand hold you through a project. If you are looking for a project \\"how to\\" book, this is not for you.

It was the kind of movie which you can sit with your family, or by yourself and thoroughly, truly, enjoy. It does not try and make you ponder the Freudian positions on the methods of psychiatry...or ponder philosophical stand-points and views that we are one with the universe. It is a movie about relationships, and love, and how to let go. If a movie does not change society, it doesn't mean that it has no value at all, it means that it is a wonderful movie to help you let go, and understand what is really important in life. Which is rather ground breaking itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"funny and touching","review":"I love this movie! It has the perfect balance of comedy, a cute story, and sentimentality.

And no, it didn't get stuck under the rock. It is worst than the ten dollars rod that I bought in Best Buy. Yes, you heard right, Best Buy. They are not a sport retailer and they sell better cheap rod. I was so upset that I took the broken rod and tied a line and a hook to it to continue fishing.

This way they get away with cheaper rods never replacing them, probably.

In the description it states that it is a medium action rod. In my personal opinion it is way more flimsy that any medium action that i have used.

When Elvis started his campaign for world wide domination with \\"Spike\\" in the late 80's, I struggled hard to stay in step. Soon, I was being trampled! Elvis abandoned styles like an old suit of clothes. On \\"The Delivery Man,\\" lyrically, it's his worst cd to date. If many of the songs were written in Mississippi, he failed to absorb the influences and it becomes another \\"Where's Elvis?\\" cd. Otherwise, Die-hard Elvis Army Fans, carry on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another disappointing release by the not-so-Angry Young Man","review":"OK, Elvis, you have proven that you can make records using every genre of music imaginable. And you have collaborated with every artist under the sun. Problem is, your career has become incredibly unfocused and your songwriting standards have sunk to all-time lows. This latest album isn't as bad as \\"North\\" but aside from \\"Monkey To Man\\", I found the songs quite forgettable...except for the opening cut \\"Bedlam\\", which is unlistenable! Now he's touring with Emmylou Harris....YECCCHHHHH. C'mon, Elvis, you can do MUCH better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"By far and away the worst cd I've bought in 2005","review":"Like a fool, I bought into the promotional campaign for this one. You saw it, the cd is pitched as Elvis' heartfelt response to spending time in the rural south and telling us all how it really is. What a sucker I feel like for allowing myself to believe the hype!The ad campaign and the cd are a load of crap. Costello completely fails to demonstrate any true affinity for the soul of this \\"music\\" (about as polite a term for this garbage as I can come up with). Evidently Lucinda Williams and Emmylou Harris fell for the same story...oh well, we'll all live and learn.Refresh my memory...do the names Stephen Stills and Ray Charles ring any bells? If Costello wants to write songs about down and out losers in the US, maybe he should write songs about the night he had a conversation with Stills about Ray and how that turned out? There's one loser in that story that Costello can personally identify with quite well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius Abides","review":"Elvis returns to somewhat original form in the context of a Deep South setting.

The ballads jerk tears. Alt-country divas Emmylou Harris and Lucinda Williams come along for the ride and do what they do to enhance the beauty and authenticity of Costello's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful new album","review":"I heard lots of these tracks live in April when EC performed at the end of a tour and found them haunting.

Its been years, after the pompus North and the the insubstantial one before that (I can't even recall it's name), the slight Bacharach collaboration (despite the glorious God Give Me Strength)...a long time between drinks, at least a decade.But truely, this is a gloriously great Costello album, warmly recorded, with humour and depth...an album that doesn't take itself too seriously (like all great Costello albums) and is full of hooks and lovely organic sounds.Elvis is back...thank god"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tales of wine and woe","review":"The fact that EC felt the need to force these loose, relaxed sessions into the framework of a (gasp!) \\"concept\\" album of sorts (about a group of rural women who are anxiously awaiting the UPS man, far as I can tell -- but your interpretation may differ, of course) makes me think that The Greatest Living Songwriter of Our Generation may be getting a tad bored with his job these days. But then again, since his muse is obviously still a very happy camper, why dwell on our hero's state of mind? Why not focus instead on the offhanded perfection of \\"The Name of This Thing is Not Love\\"? Or the beautiful trainwreck that is \\"There's a Story in Your Voice\\"?

Thank God for iTunes. If you don't need the packaging (again) it sounds like the way to go (great cover pic, though, I have to admit). Looking forward to the tour. Maybe I'll buy a tee-shirt, if it doesn't become outdated two months later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, this probably deserves 5","review":"After Richard Thompson, Elvis probably has the best track record of any living British songwriter. To come out with such strong material something like 27 years after your first album is not something many people could manage. \\"Country Darkness\\" at least is as good a song as he has ever written, and there really is not a poor track on the whole album. My only reservation is that although I absolutely love \\"There's a story in your voice\\" as a song, I don't personally much care for Lucinda William's voice, and think it a shame that he didn't get Emmylou Harris to sing on that as well, but that is probably just me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"welcome back to reel music after North","review":"This Cd is pleasure to listen to. The first track took me by surprise because it is so different from the rest of the disc.

It didn't knock me over like 'When I was Cruel' which is still a great one to listen to.. nor did it knock me out like 'Brutal Youth' -which is STILL my fav EC... but there are some very good songs on this CD. I am still taking it all in, but there is some very interesting things going on here, and lets not forget that EC keeps fresh by not doing the same darn thing over and over again... it makes me look foward to the new CD's whenever they come out... creative people never work well with others as FZappa used to say.. and the restlessness of EC is a good thing.

It makes no sense to a fan who watched the tv aired version! The second disc and third disc continues with the novela, but it doesn't even get half way through the story before it ends! It leaves you hanging there. I suggest you buy the Mexico 4 disc dvd set that is available on ebay!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD Replacement","review":"I had the same issue and contacted Xenon Pictures directly.

It chronicles, day-by-day, his early years and provides an insight into his home and parents.\\" His parents, it hardly needs saying, are David Beckham of Manchester United and Spice Girl Victoria Adams, also known as Posh Spice. Brooklyn describes life at \\"Beckingham Palace\\" , for example, bemoaning the inconsistency of his father, who has an unhealthy fascination with Mum's knickers but doesn't like changing his nappies. Brooklyn has a down-to-earth attitude that will at once provide a counterpoint to the apparently daft goings-on of his parents and yet another addition to the \\"must-have\\" set of books on the Spice Girls. Hilarious reading - a sequel to \\"Brooklyn Beckham\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT toy for all ages","review":"Purchased this toy for a 6-year-old but kids (and adults) that enjoy mind teasers and puzzles will also enjoy this one.

Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Choice if You Want Habanero More for the Flavor than for the Heat","review":"Habanero has two great advantages as a pepper--tremendous flavor and tremendous heat. The Yucatan Sunshine habanero sauce captures the former without overwhelming you with the latter. It's not the best habanero sauce I've tried, but it's the best I've tried outside of Jamaica. It's a little bit less heat than I want out of a habanero sauce (the Tabasco Brand Habanero Sauce has significantly more kick). But the primary advantage it has over the Tabasco brand is a much thinner consistency that makes it easier to apply to your food (for some reason Tabasco's habanero sauce is much thicker than their other sauces). It also has about half as many ingredients as Tabasco's habenero sauce (8 vs. 14)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't fear the habanero!","review":"To me, this is much better than Tabasco. Once you try this, Tabasco tastes too much like vinegar.Because Yucatan Sunshine uses habanero peppers, you might be worried that it is too hot but it is actually a bit more mild than Tasbasco, in my opinion.It simply has a great flavor to it! I like to put a few drops on a tortilla chip...forget about the salsa that's all you need!"},{"rating":"2","title":"YES!","review":"This is by far my favorite hot sauce and I am a bit of a connoisseur. Initially found it at a Fred Meyers and ended up going back the next week to buy it in bulk. Now they don't carry it anymore which is why I'm on Amazon :/ For my tastes it has the perfect balance of flavor and hotness. One drawback is that it usually does get lost if you're cooking with it due to the lack of potency, but as long as it's going directly on a finished product it is sublime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best but okay","review":"I had a hard time squeeking out 4 stars for this hot sauce. 3 1/2 would be more like it. The reason being it's too salty. Melinda's XXXX Reserve is balanced much better than this one and the habanero flavor shines through more with the Melinda's. The only reason I grabbed this one at the store was because it was $2.99 compared to Melinda's at $3.49. Seems trivial but this might last me one week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Storm by Ernest haycox","review":"This is a story of Portland, Oregon, during the days of the Civil War, when it was a booming frontier town with a population of five thousand and fifty-five saloons.

There too many plots going on, It didn't explain what the main plot of the movie. The characters were there,but, they didn't explore them and they acted like they were lost and looking for direction. Also the ending is just as confusing as the rest of the movie. Please, at all cost, avoid this movie. It is not worth your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Computer + Camcorder + $500 = Bad Movie","review":"With so many zombie movies coming out, 90% should be avoided.

The twists and turns were delightful, and basing the story on the real-life issues of an endangered species added a real timeliness to the plot. I am not a \\"tree-hugger,\\" but the threat to bears became very real to me. The main character, Venus Diamond, is wonderful. She is full of all the insecurities and self-doubt that most of us suffer, but is still driven to achieve her own goals on her own terms, regardless of the differing opinions of her movie star mother. She is dynamic, sardonic and combative - in other words, totally intriguing to me and I'd love to meet her. I very much look forward to finding out more about her in succeeding books."},{"rating":"1","title":"suffers from poor editing","review":"The author hangs a confusing, convoluted plot on an environmental theme. The heroine is given pretentious past and there are so many subplots introduced and then dropped that the reader can lose track of developments. The book suffers from a lack of editing.

I don't want you to go through what I did, which is sitting through this violent and disgraceful story thinking that in the end there is going to be some sort of statement made. If you don't know that dealing drugs and threatening people with guns and shooting people will eventually get you and your associates in prison or killed, than maybe you are just ignorant enough to enjoy this movie. I liked the film Belly because it at least had a positive message about transformation and choosing a better path at the end. This is a pure disgrace. It sensationalizes, glorifies, and glamorizes extortion, violence, and the objectification of women. It is disappointing that a child of Bob Marley, who has his father tattooed on his arm, would be part of a film as negative as this.

What compelled her to work with Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis? They're fine for performers who don't have strong voices but she doesn't need their trite, tired Pop formulas.

I am estastic that a beautiful, spiritually grounded, Black woman has found her a man to love and cherish her. I disagree that she is flaunting her relationship but using it as a tool to let single women(particularly Black women) that finding a good man is possibly through some hard work, self-sacrafice, and faith. I also liked \\"If I Gave You Love\\" and \\"Cry to Myself\\" however I think Chante should have stirred clear of the up-tempo music. I love her ballads and her faith in the power of love. You go on girlfriend!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OUT OF THIS WORLD...YOU GO GIRL","review":"Loving all of Chante's music, she seems to write songs that touch moments in your life.

She sounds much better when she is heard backing up Aretha Franklin on \\"Hurts Like Hell\\" from the \\"Waiting to Exhale\\" soundtrack. She's a superb back up singer. And although she's getting lots of radio and video play, her music is not timeless. In other words, people will not be singing her music 20 years from now. (Ie: her music will not will not have the longevity of soul classics like Aretha Franklin's \\"Respect\\" and Chaka Khan's \\"Tell Me Something Good).\\" Chante' is very pretty and should stick to modeling because as her cd title says, \\"This Moment is Mine.\\" And from the looks of it, her musical career is just that.............a moment."},{"rating":"1","title":"On the decline!","review":"This album was terrible! \\"Chantes Got A Man\\" was the only good track on the whole album.

I especially love Easy,Blooming Flower,Man in my life and I live for I got the Love! It takes a true Diva to follow Chaka, and do it right. The more I listen to this album the more I like it. Even the upbeat tracks are hott. It is truly time for this beautiful young lady to get the exposure that a voice like hers is so worhty of. I do hope that her label does a better job of promoing her than they have done in the past. Last time I looked she was #2 on Billboards singles chart and #7 on the albums.. What a great way to Say,\\"I am back\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bit Disappointing / Not As Awesome As I Thought","review":"I had high expectations for this CD. Unfortunately, Chante didn't reach them. She still has a beautiful voice but most of the songs put me to sleep. I love \\"If I Gave You Love, Chante's Got A Man, Easy and I Cry To Myself.\\" Everything else can be erased.By the way, I just heard Jennifer Lopez and her song sounds just like \\"If I Gave You Love.\\" Chante does a much better job. Jennifer should stick to acting. All of the slick video production/fine body having in the world will not give her a better singing voice.Sorry Chante. Better luck next time on the CD. Four out of Fourteen is not a very good thing. Maybe Kadeem is making you a little bit too happy and your listening and discerning skills have been lowered. Rethink your choice of producers and beg George Duke to work with you again.Believe me, I am not playa hating...I just expected better from you...:("},{"rating":"2","title":"Chante makes me want to fall in love.","review":"Sparkling album!

That album had a smoooth, soulful, sometimes jazzy sound that made me SO glad I picked up that album... this woman has much more substance than any of those photographs could have shown. However, this album has gone the way of overproduced R&B that is quite typical of today (if Puff Daddy jumps headlong into R&B, I am retreating to Doestoevsky.. he frightens me ;->).. this woman has a lot of talent and she helped me find a new found respect and liking for this style of music. Chante might have a man now, but unless she gets back to the act she does well and puts out a good album, that man may be all she gets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure and Utter Garbage....","review":"This album was a pure disappointment. Cross-over, commericalized, and downright garbage. Chante has a beautiful voice but these songs were painful to listen to. I realize she got her man but if she puts out another album like this one, Chante won't have a career. If you are really interested in some of her best work look for Precious and Love Supreme. I am going to burn this CD in a bonfire!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what waste","review":"Chante Moore can sing.but her talent is wasted on this by the numbers sounding R-N-B of today.trying to cross-over and working with the hot producers of today do nothing for her at all except put her in the used bin pile.that's sad cuz she has real talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather a chore to read","review":"I would only recommend this book to students of the 14th or 15th century. The plot is ponderous and the characters un-engaging. The atmosphere of the Middle Ages seems well drawn and is the best part of the book. After reading of certain \\"medical\\" remedies it is a wonder the human race even survived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this the most annoying book I've ever read?","review":"I know this isn't the worst book I've ever read but it may be the most annoying. I can't imagine why Ackroyd wrote this book.I don't care to find an answer to the mystery at the heart of the book because I don't care about any of the characters in the book.The book is a silly waste of the reader's time and the author's effort.Ackroyd should have written an historical essay on London in the Middle Ages and not foist his copious knowledge onto such a silly and witless plot.I give it two stars only because of the local colour and fabulous vocabulary of old English words and terms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ackroyd's Canterbury Tales","review":"Beautifully written - an interesting tale and portrait of London based on the Canterbury Tales set against a backdroop of religious machinations. Worth the read and entetaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've read in a while!","review":"To say I enjoyed this book is an understatement. I devoured it. The plot is tightly wound with sub-plots and counter-plots and counter-counter-plots. The setting and the characters are rich and detailed and ring true to the period. Without a whole lot of lecturing, Ackroyd gives us an overview of the connections and interplay of the church and state in 14th century England. Don't miss this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Garbage","review":"To begin with the author of this book could not write his way out of a paper bag, he has no idea how to build an interesting narrative and no knowledge of the actual period he is writing about. Not only does Ackroyd miss the point of the Canterbury Tales, a reader with any knowledge of history will wonder if Ackroyd has ever read a book about the rebellion that brought Henry Bolingbroke to the throne. This crap might be appealing to someone who knows nothing of the middle ages and buys into Dan Brown style conspiracy BS, but anyone who actually thinks and reads other books will see this for the garbage it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliantly emotional story which is well worth reading.","review":"Twelve days to get your marriage back on track and meld a family together of three small children who have, to all intents and purposes, been abandoned. Rachel, already suffering from depression, is jolted out of herself by the arrival of her social worker Aunt Miriam with the children in tow. There is nowhere to place them over Christmas...Teresa Hill has done a superlative job of this emotionally draining, but deeply satisfying novel. Her main characters, Sam and Rachel, are likeable people in deep despair, but whose efforts to work their way through their problems while trying to reassure and support the frightened children in their care allowed me to invest in their future. Also to shed a few tears.A wonderful, well-written book which ended in a most satisfying and realistic manner, which prompted me to immediate fire up my kindle and purchase the other three books in the series.Congratulations, Teresa Hill, you did a fantastic job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Five hankie read!","review":"I consider myself a somewhat picky reader, but when I bought and read this book years ago, I was so caught up in it that I couldn't put it down except to reach for the tissues box! I had to share this with my mom, and she called me up when she was in the middle of it, sniffling into her tissue, telling me how wonderful it was. This is definitely a mother-daughter share read.The emotional struggles of Sam and Rachel because of their experience with foster care and adoption are real and heartbreaking, as are the coping mechanisms of the children involved. Yet Teresa Hill makes this heartwarming story truly uplifting. One of my favorites, especially for Christmas!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, heartwarming book","review":"I grabbed this book when it came up for the free promotion, and I'm glad I did.

It is one that makes you feel so happy & grateful for what you have. Rachel & Sam were a couple who had always wanted children & were so very close to having one of their own when one snowing takes that away. Never to be able to have that chance again & all other attempts leading to heart ache. But, one Dec. Day Rachel's aunt shows up at her home with three foster children she needs them to care for on an emergency basis. This is where all the real drama begins. This story just has so much going on you can't or at least don't want to stop reading. If I had to say their was anything I didn't like it was Sam acting like such a winer & a wimp or maybe it was a backbone he seemed to lack at times.

I was pretty sure I knew what would happen in the end...maybe didn't foresee all of the twist along the way. Felt like the back & forth in the relationship between Sam & Rachel didn't feel completely believable. Even though I can understand they were both hurt in life, the continual suggestion that they wouldn't stay together just didn't ring true for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twelve Days","review":"I like this book because I am sentimental at heart. have an idea what will happen but still kept on reading, got to be a little too long, but love the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute Shoe, but Not for Wide Feet","review":"I got these shoes in the taupe suede and thought they were adorable until I tried to get them on my feet. I wear a 10W and have no trouble with other Naturalizer shoes, but this is a Mary Jane, and although the shoe would be wide enough for my foot, the strap is not! The button doesn't unbutton, and even with the elastic band stretched as far as it will go, I still couldn't get the shoe on. My foot is wide but not especially fat or tall, but even so the strap is about 1-1/2 inches too short. I am tremendously disappointed, because there is no way to extend the strap (or remove it) without ruining the look of the shoe. Maybe a narrow foot will have no issue with the strap, but if you wear a wide size, forget it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable cuties with button issues","review":"A very comfortable shoe for my narrow width, stylish, and feminine; however, after six months one of the buttons came off (and was lost) and the other button is loose.

The strap is nonmobile,and with absolutely no flexibility caused problems. I got these shoes for a wedding but when I slipped my feet into them the right shoe tore. The only reason I am giving this two stars is this. Naturalizer tends to be a good shoe, and the quality of the left shoe was decent.I have very high arches, hence my disclaimer, this shoe is for the low of arch.

What I like most about these classic children's stories (aside from the fact that they are simply fantastic stories of complexity and intricacy) is the diversity and range of context, these stories (and the morals and values) are not always so sanitized that they strip us of the realities of the sometimes harsh world we live in.

The rap/rock fusion is a slight improvement from The Great Milenko. This cd does has some short comings though. Personally, I hate it when ICP has guest appearences outside of the Dark Carnival family, just wasn't diggin the songs with ODB or Snoop. Also, this disc has gotten less and less play over the years for me. For years I thought this was probably the third best joker's card, but all these years later, I find myself listening to Milenko, Ringmaster, and Riddlebox the most.

With ICP, you get crassness parading as anti-authoritarianism, loudness parading as passion, idiotic costumes parading as showmanship, and a god-awful talentless hybrid of rap and metal parading as innovation.

I for sure think that is childish and is a sack of crap.DON&quot;T BUY ICP THEY SUCK!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS THE WORST GARBAGE YOU CAN BUY","review":"I have heard some of the Insane Clown posses music so I thought this would be a good album. I turned out that it really sucked I could barely listen to the entire thing. They just swear and swear. I have nothing against swearing but it was boring how they kept using the F word to a bad beet. The only reason to buy this album is to throw away money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"I can see why these dudes stay in the Underground scene, NOT cuz they want to, but cuz are wack. I didn't know what a juggalo was until a few months ago, I worked with a guy that was really into it and I took a listen, I didn't want to be rude to the guy and say this sucks. I just told him that isn't my style of music, not because I can't handle it, but because it is the most wack stuff I've every heard. I don't know how these dudes get any respect in the rap industry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"I can see why these dudes have stayed underground for so long, cuz they're wack as hell. I see a lot of people saying that they stay underground cuz they like it, NO they don't they stay underground cuz they are wack, and only people that have no lives listen to their music. Don't buy the cd it is wack, wack beats, and rhymes. My 2 year old sister could rhymes better then that, and I don't even have one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I could make a better cd with $2.45 and 5 minutes","review":"Gimmicky. The only reason this band is famous is cuz they swear a lot (whooptee doo kiddies, that requires lots of talent) and cuz they constantly insult people. Wow, now THAT'S talent.

This is just 60 minutes of none stop bullsh-t."},{"rating":"2","title":"not bad...but not as good as the old stuff","review":"ICP is my fave band. I've listened to them for a long time, since COC, but even so this album was somewhat of a letdown. It's still the ICP but the sounds have changed. I didnt hear much if any circus music on this one...but the songs are still great and ICP still has their story telling powers. I dont see why people are shocked by \\"Fuxk the world\\". So they say fuxk 93 times, big deal. ICP isnt just about cussing, no mater what people say. They have messages and if you listen you get something out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meaningless","review":"I own all 5 Joker cards but this one sucks. The lyrics on this are meaningless and have nothing to do with the dark carnival. I now claim I'm a former fan after ICP sold out at Woodstock for $100,000 when they said they wouldn't play for anyone who wasn't a juggalo. All their music now are sell outs trying to be funny and getting away from why they started. I'm disapointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too great","review":"I like ICP, but this album was horrible.

I am very musically inclined, so when I heard about insane clown posse I had to purchase it. This CD has the deepest and best lyrics espescially in one of the finest songs (Jake Jekel). I love this CD just because it makes me feel like I am in a circus. When they talk about stabbing in the stab song, I am like WHOA! that stab song is staberific. I love listening to this cd in the dark because I can dance wearing my grandma's girdel. The ICP from the PCI (Pacific Colorado Inlet).

It sounds like all of their other releases only the rapping is ten times worse! Violent j even attempts to sing. Most of it sounds like they made it up as they went along. They rip off of Esham again by stealing the track Fxxk the World which Natas did in 1995. They try to remake a Geto Boys song but it sounds more like a Pantera remake with the heavy metal guitars. They can't even stay on beat! Words can't describe just how bad this album really is! It almost makes Backstreet Boys and Jennifer Lopez sound good. All I can do is warn you proceed at your own risk. You might as well buy an Esham, Natas, Brotha Lynch Hung, Ganksta Nip, or Insane Poetry album. All groups that ICP stole from."},{"rating":"1","title":"icp sucks","review":"Icp is the most untalented rap group ive ever heard. their rhymes are weak and the all sound the same. the only reason they are popular is because they appeal to the gothic kids with shocking and violent lyrics. thats the only reason anyone likes them. no true rap fan does.

It had about a total of 12 minutes of the main man in his best form, yet the rest of the presentation was a collection of other comedians that are OK but not the stuff I was after. I can only take so much Tim Allen. There is only one Rodney and the others pale next to him but I would have liked a little more camera time with the king.

If your looking for something to take your mind off your day to day life, Drama Queen is the way to do it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Drama At It's Best","review":"I have to say that I am with the majority on this book, you will not want to put it down. For those few who didn't like it, you're entitled to your opinion but in MY opinion La Jill Hunt accomplished what many great authors before her have managed to do which is make you identify with the characters and leave you wanting more. When you read this book it'll make you want friends like Roni, Tia, Yvonne, and Terrell. If you already have these types of friends this book makes you appreciate them even more. The main character, Kayla, is not only beautiful but intelligent with a good support system of friends and family. Kayla has flaws like we all do so at times she makes decisions that aren't always right but you will never stop rooting for her. I loved this book and can't wait for the sequel and any other books from Ms. Hunt."},{"rating":"2","title":"good read/shocking end","review":"This was a good book!! At first , like other books for me, I had to force myself to get through the first few pages, but once I got into the story, it was great! It is definitely a page turner, and my mouth hit the floor when I read the very last sentence, I had to read it about three times to make sure my eyes weren't playing tricks on me. Get this book, you'll want to read it over and over again. Great job Lajill!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enough Drama For Your Mama,LOL","review":"This was a Drama fast paced read once it got going.

This was well worth my dime. It had drama but also a positive message involved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good 1st novel","review":"This was a very good book from beginning to end. I think LaJill did a really good job. I also felt like I knew Kayla and the other characters personally.

Absolutely loved this book. The love triangle between Geno-Kayla-Craig was just hot. And her circle of friends were just full of antics. The book expresses to people that no matter how much drama and sh!# thrown at you, as long you have family and friends to support and love you, you will be strong in the end.To my cuz, LaJill: You work your thing girl.

My friend (Crystal) tells me to read it the girl talks just like you. So ok I get the book and I was hooked. I think this was a great read, fast funny and to the point. She didn't tell me this story was so close to me. I could have written it! Ms.Hunt I feel you trust me I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Around every corner DRAMA","review":"I liked this book and I can certainly see why the author gives the book this title. However, some of the \\"drama\\" filled events that happened to Kayla seemed unrealistic. I mean I just cannot image a person going through that much drama every day for I guess what was supposed to be a years time. I too like other readers have expressed am glad that there is a sequel, but I wanted the sequel to continue along the same story lines. But from what I've been reading the main characters become the minor ones in the sequel and vice versa. I don't think the full story has been told as far as Craig, Kayla, and Geno."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drama, Drama, Drama That I Could Not Handle...","review":"This book was very good from start to finish. Kayla was the Drama Queen. She was a good, intelligent and made some sound decisions. That sister of hers was just a straight devil. I don't think I would have been so half way as easy as Kayla was if I had caught my sister in bed with my soon to be husband. The fact that the sister was jealous of Kayla was so hear breaking. Mom and Dad should have been a little more strict when it came to Angelica. Kayla also made the right decision when she quit her job at the school. You cannot teach a class when there is one very disruptive student that you are not able to teach the rest of the class.This book is very good for book club choice. You can have some serious dicussions about the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!!!","review":"I thought this book was a great read. The author used characters and situations that anyone could have found themselves in. It wasn't a hard core novel that tried to be all deep like a lot of books are these days. And I don't inderstand how some people actually felt that there was no drama. Different strokes for different folks, I guess. Like another reviewer said, maybe they should consider writing something on their own and enlighten us on whatever 'DRAMA' is! It was a light hearted, fun read that held my attention throughout. I give Ms. Hunt five stars because for a first effort, I believe she did an outstanding job. I look forward to the sequel!!! In regards to the name pet peeve, I knew my children's names since I was in the fourth grade, nicknames and all!!! Awesome job, Lajill. Keep up the great work."},{"rating":"2","title":"CAN U SAY DRAMA","review":"I finish this book in a day and a half. This book is filled with so much drama, it makes your life look simple.

I have the sequel No More Drama right in front of me and cant wait to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"A good read as always from Lajill Hunt.

She wakes up to drama of all sorts, her family,love life,job etc. You will not be able to put this bok done until the end. I was mad when I got to the last page because there was no more :0) LaJill did a A+ job on this one and Part 2 was good also! I demand you read this one,you'll thank me when your done."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you can't have the one you love","review":"It should of been called backstabber. It started off with the sister of Kayla stepping way out of line with her sister about to be husband. Than Kayla finding herself falling for Craig that looks just like her ex-man Geno. She was very lonely and hurt by her sister and Geno so she went with Craig and he turns out to be her nightmare from hell. Than Geno comes back for another chance to resolve the problem that broke them up. To find her trying to have all her cookies in one cookie jar and Geno wasn't having it. Kayle found herself beening pulled by two guys that she thought loved her but turned out that only one was true to the game.Over all this book was totally awesome and I couldn't put it down. From begining to end it's a eye catcher, all the characters are brought to life. This is the second book of her's that I have read and she's a totally good author."},{"rating":"1","title":"No solutions offered...","review":"It's not that what some of Dr. Tannen says isn't true, but she ruins it by pointing out OVER AND OVER how it's basically society's (i.e.: men's) fault for every problem/shortcoming women have ever experienced. She doesn't hold women responsible for any of their own problems (which, in itself, is sexist towards women), and then, offers no solutions AT ALL on how to correct these problems. Basically, she runs through all the problems women have...and then the book ends"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some Good Points but Frustrating to Read","review":"Certain parts of this book are though provoking, but for the most part the author offers few solutions...A better book to purchase would be any of the John Gray books, MEN ARE FROM MARS AND WOMEN ARE FROM VENUS would be a good start. While it takes a traditional approach (i.e. don't forget he was writing it for his age group) towards relationships, it offers many more workable solutions than this book.Overall, I think women will find this book easier to work w/ for obvious reasons. However, any women who truly want a workable relationship and who aren't trying to be bitchy will probably seek their information elsewhere....sorry, Tamnen."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are a man, do not buy this audiobook !","review":"After listening to this audiobook I was left feeling that I just wasted my time. Men are portrayed as insincere and mean. This book does not offer any methods for improving relationships, it is just a guy bashing session. The author (a woman) tries to use BIG words to sound more intelligent, she said \\"fleeting\\" every other paragraph. Deborah Tannen also has a very poor speaking voice that is very unassertive and weak. She has a dry mouth throughout the entire program (take a drink of water, please). She also explained that men stereotype women, there are also many sterotypes for men, lets be fair. Hey I will be the first one to admit that men are not perfect, but this book is categorizing men and women and definitely one ups women. If you are a women you may like this tape, but it was not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"hated it.","review":"had to read this for school and i think it is one of the most repetetive, sterotypical male-bashing books i've read in awhile. she tries to paint an unbiased picture but gets lost around midway through her first sentence. DON'T BUY IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential to relationships","review":"I originally found this title through a referral in Lori Gammon's threesome book. Although she recommended it as a bi seduction aid, I believe that ALL couples should learn how to tell their partners what they want from each other, in bed and otherwise. This book explains all the communication pitfalls couples encounter in a close relationship and how to overcome the problems that result. If you don't know why you aren't happy, read this book and find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and usefule...","review":"Clearly men and women have difficulties communicating at times and it can be extremely frustrating inside of relationship. Learning the dynamics of successful communication takes patience and a willingness to understand that men and women ARE different. Tannen's book demonstrates this fact in an easy to read and useful style. I also highly recommendBreaking the Argument Cycle: How to Stop Fighting Without Therapyby Sharon Rivkin. Rivkin shows that we often fall into a particular pattern of arguing that can live on for the life of a relationship and create painful and ongoing conflict. Her highly effective techniques show how to resolve conflicts in a simple, three-step process and turn even the most argumentative relationships into loving and intimate bonds that can last a lifetime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Psychogibberish","review":"Having studied linguistics in depth over the years, especially Tannen's mentor, Robin Lakoff, I feel this book does a disservice to its topic. I think that, as old as they are, the best books on the subject of man-talk versus woman-talk are by Dr. Joyce Brothers.Men come off rather badly overall in this book, which I think reinforces the stereotypes of men being rotten communicators who never listen.The book gets one star because it has an excellent reference list and great notes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will this ever come out on Kindle?","review":"Will this ever come out on Kindle? I just read \\"Can't We Talk?\\" (condensed from: You Just Don't Understand) online and shared it with my partner. I would love to read the whole book.

Our memory is supported by the structural skeleton of language--a lot of what we know is wrapped up in words. The biggest failures of communication between product designers and their audience come from language failures.For more book reviews, please visit: [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"No You Really DON'T Understand","review":"Tannen's pop-gender theory just isn't cutting it. In academic circles, Tannen's ideas are as outdated as the hoop skirt. Elsewhere, they fall flat, poised on experiments without controls, haphazard 'examples' drawn from mysterious (and never defined or outlined) encounters with random people.Gone is social context, and other differences (cultural, age, and class) are never even considered in Tannen's book. Instead, she expects her readers to attribute all her described linguistic methods to mere gender difference. As a result, this book reads more like a dime-store novel than an intelligent critique of modern communication.A perfect example of what NOT to read if you are interested in gender theory or writings on gendered language."},{"rating":"2","title":"I teach nursing and I use this with male students","review":"not much to say that hasn't already been said.I teach nursing ( I am a guy) and I often see male students who aren't succeeding, for various reasons. Maybe they don't seem to interact with the women students in their class; maybe they hav e never had a woman as a supervisor, such as a couple of military veterans I have taught. In some cases, they don't know how to accept supervision from a female faculty member. Whatever the reason, lack of effectibve communication is the key. That's where this book comes in. I make sure they get it and study it, so as to understand the often-unwritten dos and don'ts of the workplace. this book provides a number of \\"aha\\" moments - times when the light bulb is turned on in their head for the very first time. it's the kind of book you can read a few aparagraphs at a time and still learn from. a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Just Don't Understand.....","review":"This was a book that my granddaughter needed for a class.

I was excited to read this book but sorry to say that it seemed to simply reference a lot of clich�� interactions in human communication where one side is blatantly childish. The childish person (always the male) is theorized to be motivated by nothing more than opportunity to enforce a shred of primitive dominance. While females cannot even grasp the abstract principal of something so simple as sportsman competition."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're from Mars, this book may need translation","review":"John Gray did the male gender no favors by characterizing us guys as \\"from Mars\\". Fortunately, Deborah Tannen knows better. Despite her male detractors, who usually find fault with what they consider overindulgence of the more estrogen-laden of our species, Dr. Tannen strives (and succeeds) at maintaining a refreshing academic distance from a strong gender bias in this seminal work. Her anecdotal examples of male and female communication styles are convincing and rub no ones noses in their own verbal messes. Having found impenetrable more than one woman's labyrinth of words and feelings, it was quite comforting to find from a woman a sympathetic spirit. If you have tried reading \\"Men Are From Mars...\\" and were put off by the premise, \\"You Just Don't Understand\\" may provide a welcome alternative in the male/female communication blues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy into the bull","review":"I love how psychologists like to explain behavior to people assuming that all men are alike and all women are alike which just isn't true. Don't buy this book and don't buy Men are From Venus by John Gray. Buy Socionics by Rod Novichkov, figure out what personality type you are and who your best match is then get that person in you life-only then will you see that communication problem has nothing to do with whether you're a woman or a man (another words, it's not your problem, it's that your relationship is THE problem)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read on different communication styles","review":"I read this book a few years ago and continue to see the ways every day that boys and girls are conditioned differently. This conditioning is expressed in men and women through (sometimes) vastly different communication styles. The material is insightful and clear, though some of the case studies can be a tedious read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-simplified version of life that doesn't ring true.","review":"This book aspires to explain sociological conditioning of the sexes in an over-simplified manner. While the idea that men and women communicate differently is one with socio-linguistic merit, and worthy of study, it is not soley GENDER based. There are more issues to be explored and included that were not (class, age, background, to name a few). I was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for couples","review":"This book is a great read for couples and single persons who wish to understand how the opposite sex thinks. I would describe this book as an intellectual version of \\"Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus.\\" The author uses great examples to illustrate her points and often employs role reversals to show how both sexes can approach problems from stereotyped points of view (i.e. both men and women can be insensitive). Well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"People from Mars may need translation","review":"John Gray did the male gender no favors by characterizing us guys as \\"from Mars\\". Fortunately, Deborah Tannen knows better. Despite her male detractors, who usually find fault with what they consider overindulgence of the more estrogen-laden of our species, Dr. Tannen strives (and succeeds) at maintaining a refreshing academic distance from a strong gender bias in this seminal work. Her anecdotal examples of male and female communication styles are convincing and rub no ones noses in their own verbal messes. Having found impenetrable more than one woman's labyrinth of words and feelings, it was quite comforting to find from a woman a sympathetic spirit. If you have tried reading \\"Men Are From Mars...\\" and were put off by the premise, \\"You Just Don't Understand\\" may provide a welcome alternative in the male/female communication blues."},{"rating":"2","title":"LIfe changing","review":"I entered this book with scepticism but found it to be one of the most interesting and practical books I've ever read. It's interesting because it describes how and why the opposite sex has a general communication \\"style\\". It's practical and very valuable if you want to understand and improve communication with the opposite sex (I'm male) at home, work, or play. Tannen suggests that men and women be flexible and sensitive to these basic (but not absolute) communication styles.I have been flexible and... it works!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So bad it's Good","review":"I agree with an earlier review of said movie, but the sub-par plot, acting, and production values are exactly the reasons why this movie is so cool.

Lovers of European horror movies from that period will probably enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"watched it many times","review":"I was pleasantly surprised with this film. I've always been a fan of the \\"Eurotrash\\" horror films, and this one is no exception. The gore and mayhem is tame comapred to the Argento fare, however, the movie rides through with its eerie and subtle style. There is, of course, the 'token' lesbian scene, that's actually artfully done. The lone man on the side of the road (who is that actor?) is very impressive and he was cast perfectly.Contrary to one of the reviewers, the opening scene does not represent a Nazi officer at the birth of his daughter, rather a German Army (Wehrmacht) Officer - quite different from their Nazi counterparts. Much of the German Aristocracy was wiped out during the war, by the Nazis.the harpsichord based soundtrack is great too!I bought the double disc set with another film, but now wish i had bought this copy, (missing the introduction as listed in the above review)enjoy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"Erika Blanc would have been wise to pass on this piece of work as im sure it helped kill an already mediocre career.

The Pink Panther is cold and hungry on Christmas. He'll try anything to get a hot meal, but nothing seems to work out for him (as usual). There is no dialog, but I think this just enhances the special. I also really love the songs! Its pretty funny and enjoyable. One drawback is the animation is alot like the other pink panther cartoons (which are fairly old) (Think: \\"Yes Virgina, there is a Santa Claus\\") So its a bit crude and only a few colours are used (alot of the stuff seems overly pinky/orange).

So I rented both the original Phantasm in addition to this horrible film. Phantasm 4 is everything the first is not. There is no fear, no atmosphere, no action, no sense. The origin of the Tall Man is (sorta) revealed, but the revelation brings no resolution. Reggie continues to think with his little head instead of his big one, which explains why his lines are soooo bad. And Mike's role in the movie is incredibly vague; is he hero, victim, or the Tall Man's reluctant apprentice? I loved the first movie. Sure, it was no Academy Award winner, but it had some cool suspense and action. Unfortunately, each sequel gets progressively worse. Stick with the original and save your bucks; it was the only one in the series really worth seeing."},{"rating":"1","title":"what cares about plot","review":"I don't remember much about Part 4 other than the fact that there's not much action like in Part 2 & 3. It was really boring. And there wasn't hardly any special effects.

And everyone raves about how good Lord of the Dead was. Now maybe it's just me, but I foud this one very enjoyable. It was a darker film than the last two, but it returned to the style of the first film, letting the images tell the story. Everyone is so upset by the \\"non-ending\\", but hs everyone forgotten the first film? It ended just as quickly and abruptly. So, all in all I liked this on, maybe just slightly more than part 2 as far as sequels go. I'm glad the elements and characters from part three were left out also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phantasm 4 hopefully not the final chapter","review":"I just got finished watching the movie and I just want to say that I don't think that it lived up to the original but it was pretty good anyway. The only thing I didn't like about the movie is when they added in scenes to this movie using outtakes from the original Phantasm they just didn't seem to tie in to this movie. Also I would've liked for them to have explored the character of Jebidiah Morningside a little bit more. And for once I wished they could've at least finished the film on a happy note but once again the Tall Man! triumps over all."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Tall Man returns for an excellent encore!","review":"Phantasm: Oblivion is a challenging film. It may take several viewings to understand the sublime concepts this film presents. But, for the dedicated Phantasm fan, Oblivion is the jolt of Phantasmic adrenaline we have all been waiting for.

The result is haunting and compelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Part IV was very good","review":"This movie had clips from previous movies as well as unseen clips in previous movies that helped the story line.

Better the second time!","review":"The first time I watched this movie, there were some confusing moments, but mainly, this movie was one of those that you can't just watch a first time and must be experienced a second to achieve the full effect! A worthy addition to the beloved Phantasm series, and I only hope that a five is in the works!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Final Chapter?","review":"In the latest installment of Coscarelli's classic Phantasm series, we almost think we're watching a normal movie here...just for a few minutes!The special effects are better than previous philms, and the movie as a whole takes itself a lot more seriously than its predecessors. That fact will surely be viewed positively by some, negatively by others; positively by those who want these films to get more respect, negatively by those who loved the lack of plot continuity, hack dialogue, and low-budget special effects.Old school Phantasm Phans, don't worry - the movie still captures the good old Phantasm magic: The Tall Man still does his thing (and knowing his background is pretty cool - I almost fell out of my seat when pre-Tall Man Jebediah offers Mike some lemonade!!!), Reggie has his destined to fail romantic interlude, and the 'Cuda can still rock.All in all, a good ending to the series, with the possibility left open for more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST SEQUEL!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Phantasm:Oblivion is undoubtedly the best sequel in the Phantasm series, it goes deeper into the psychilogical aspect of the film, instead of secrets being revealed through speech, it is revealed through motions and thought of the viewer.

It is really interesting to see Bernstein dealing with the orchestra and soloists in order to elicit their best to create this wonderful recording of his very own masterpiece!

The stereotypical, earth mother, lesbian-next-door becomes her mentor and takes her under her wing immediately (of course) and on her first trip to a gay bar a gorgeous woman buys our shy, beautiful Mary Sue a drink (of course). Throw in Taylor's bitchy ex, Melanie's selfish cousin for some angst and WAY too many pop culture references (including a semi-obsession with Xena) and there you have it - second-rate fanfic - except it's with characters you don't know and don't care about."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"There's a shortage of good lesbian authors, so I won't be too harsh on Ms. Beers, but this book is really not worth the money.

While no book is a replcement for a good teacher, Seidman gives you enough to get out and teach yourself basic strokes, braces and perhaps even rolls- though that's something best seen demonstrated first.The photos are one of the strongest parts of the book, and a good argument for buying it- next to the \\"Perforamance Sea Kayaking\\" video Seidman's book has the best illustrations of basic moves to be found anywhere.

The music is catchy and addictive, the message is bold and evangelical, and the quality of the recording is stunning. One of my favorite aspects of Live from Portland, is the preaching Kutless does. It's warming to the heart and soul to hear these guys confess and share their love for Christ. Another strong point of the CD is it's variety. All of Kutless's albums are sampled very nicely on this CD-DVD set.BOTTOM LINEIf you are a fan of Kutless or Christian Rock you will enjoy this CD very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Kutless.","review":"Their style is unique and original and always encouraging.

I wish I had looked into the transfer issues - this is a great Christmas movie, with an awesome cast.I would not recommend this for owners of large widescreen TVs.

I had not heard of it before, and since first viewing it, watch it three times.It is a holiday movie, where the holiday is understated. This movie with Kevin Spacey playing the husband is just hilarious. There is a lot of language in the movie, so, be prepared for that. The angst that Spacey and Davis going at throughout the movie is simply hilarious. You wonder how people could hate each other so much. The interplay with Spacey's extended family is really funny.It is like taking a Christmas dinner where the family does not get along, and adding a lot of spice to it. There are so many funny scenes in the movie that you will not know what is coming next.This movie is great for couples and friends to watch together, not a family movie, the language is too stiff."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this film","review":"This is a comedy like no other.

It is not a family movie or one for kids even though is supposed to be a Christmas, holiday film. Dennis Leary brings a lot to the film with a strong supporting cast of Judy Davis and Kevin Spacey. The storyline I thought was well written in that many parts of the movie nearly reminded me of my family, unfortunately. I could relate to it in many ways and even opened my eyes to different views of life. If you enjoy serious, mature comedy's and have not seen it be sure to do and think you could agree.Peter J. Miller"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstandingly funny!!!","review":"Leary, Spacey and Davis have great chemistry, which takes the comical dialog to histerical levels. Their comedic timing is flawless. Everytime I see this movie I find something new to laugh at. It is definately one of Spacey's funniest roles. He and Judy Davis do superb jobs at keeping up with Leary, if not surpassing him. I definately think that anyone looking for a good movie should try this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sure winner. You think the Griswald's were dysfunctional?","review":"Outstanding! Very few comedies are able to surprise me with laughs. Most movies you see the jokes coming 3 minutes before they arrive.Spacey & Leary are an outstanding duo.

Well...rewind those tapes and put them back in your closet. There is only one thing funnier than a dysfunctional family...a dysfunctional family at Christmas!! And it doesn't get much better than this one. This movie is a riot! The Christmas dinner scenes alone are worth the watch. Great cast...Kevin Spacey, Denis Leary, Judy Davis, Christine Baranski, and Glynis Johns (any baby boomers out there remember Lady Penelope Peasoup from the 1966 Batman series?). The writing is clever and quick-witted in this movie, the lines, the quips...just watch it. You won't regret it! Glad to see it FINALLY become available on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kevin Spacey & Judy Davis are a great pair.","review":"Very funny movie. Kevin Spacey apparently can play any type of role. Anything he's ever in, he does a wonderful job but I had never seen him in a comedy. He's great and so is Judy Davis. They really do remind you of people you know. They never agree on anything and can start an argument on any subject. Denis Leary who is there to rob them ends up being the ref in their arguments. He's very funny too. The mother-in-law, the kid, Santa Claus, the whole cast is good. Good movie with a lot of laughs."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's a Rebel!","review":"Great book, fantastic read. Keeps the reader very interested as well as informed about the politics of the music business. It's a shame that her voice was manipulated and pimped the way it was, not given recognition for classic hits such as \\"The Doo Run Run\\" and \\"He's A Rebel\\". This art of switching voices wasn't made public until the 1990's with the Milli Vanilli and Black Box scandel, but clearly this act had been in existence forever. After learning that she was on the hit 1960's show \\"Shindig\\", I purchased several of the classic videotapes. She was not exaggerating- she has a wonderful voice and deserves to be amongst the legendary pantheon of female singers. I would recommend this book to any artist seeking to enter the music business for the pros and cons, and anybody, overall who just enjoys a good, rock and roll memoir."},{"rating":"1","title":"Darlene Love is not totally honest.","review":"Darlene Love inferred that she had recorded a track for the hit song Da Doo Ron Ron.

And the relationships between the characters are developing well... the reader is introduced to everyone in the first book... and reading the second one is like being re-united with old friends. And i am looking forward to the third one to see if the budding romance from this novel continues.Whereas i'd hardly call this book quality literature... it was a lot of fun for a rainy saturday afternoon... and for [money] is a lot better than most of the movies in theaters now! It's a great read for animal/mystery lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"As True a Picture You'll Get of Folks from a Small Town.","review":"I enjoyed this second book in the Mrs. Murphy series much more than the first, and the main reason for that is that the author has painted a true-to-life picture of what it's like to live in the country and in a small town. I certainly could see parallels to my own life in the descriptions of country living and folks helping others. Also, I didn't find the animals as distracting this time (maybe because I knew what to expect this time round). Anyway, the mystery in this book is a good one and it will keep you guessing until the end. In it we get to know Harry a little better, as well as her numerous wonderful friends. Ms. Brown does a good job of characterization for her somewhat eccentric cast of characters. The story starts with various human body parts showing up in very strange places. It certainly puts the citizens of Crozon on the alert and sets the stage for more murder and mayhem. All in all a pretty good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book, like its victim, is dismembered.","review":"Unlike some others, I will never put Brown in the same league as Agatha Christie. Brown is so sophomoric in comparison. If you want to read a really good mystery, read Christie. If you want to be merely entertained by a mystery, read Lilian Jackson Braun's \\"The Cat Who...\\" series. Braun is a better writer than Brown. She even has a better imagination. If you want purely escapist fare in your mysteries then Brown is precisely the ticket you want. In this particular novel, Brown took a perfectly good idea or two and proceeded to be perfectly mediocre in her treatment of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"wasn't exactly thrilled...","review":"Being a fan of the Lilian Jackon Braun mysteries, and the Mitford Series, I thought I'd give these books a try for some \\"light reading\\" after seeing them displayed in Wal-Mart. I'm attracted to books about small-town living, animals, mysteries, you get the idea.I only read 3 chapters and decided not to finish. There was an large use of profanity, both from the human and animal characters. Not just common swear words, but ones that would get Ralphie's mouth washed out with soap (referring to the movie, \\"The Christmas Story\\"). If the use of these words had been less frequent, I could've overlooked them and continued reading, but they appeared too frequently for my taste. The level of frequency was something I'd expect from ...well I don't know - I don't read books with lots of swear words.Sorry, but I won't be recommending these mysteries to anyone I know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you so very much.

It turned out to be the Night Flier."},{"rating":"2","title":"I guess disfigured monsters are cool","review":"Well let's just say I wouldn't recommend eating during this film. The whole blood and gore thing got a little out of hand... looked as if the directors went a little catsup happy all over the airport walls. So if you enjoy watching scary zombie things and a hideously disfigured monster trying to eat people, this is your movie. The plot was pretty good, but it wasn't really what I expected. The bloody scenes were just there to kind of give you that nausiating-scared feeling King usually emits in his movies/books... The only thing that kept me from giving this movie a 5 was the fact that the plot was a little gay... it could've used a little more spice and conflict and a little less fake blood and zombies."},{"rating":"2","title":"This has got to be the best Steven King movie I saw.","review":"I realllly like horror movies.

The good captain was correct, and, unfortunately, Mr. King's recent projects are excellent evidence of this. All of the fundamentals of good fiction are violated in this movie. The \\"heroes\\" are so totally flawed that it is impossible to develop any real sympathy for them, so you end up not caring when the crap goes down at the end. The plot is poorly paced and boringly repetitive. The final result seems to be a commentary on how bad paparazzi-type jounalists are, instead of what it could have been: a rousing story of a pair of journalists on a merry hunt to find a vampire. Also, wayyy too much blood and gore. Whoever produced this disappointing film should watch the original \\"Haunting\\" to see how a good horror movie is done. My advice? Let \\"The Night Flier\\" crash into the sea of obscurity, there to be lost forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"NIGHT FLIER","review":"NOT BAD MOVIE. THE ACTING WAS GOOD LOCATIONS PRETTY GOOD.

In this case, the producer & director didn't mess his book or story up... again. Xcellent acting also. The only reason I give it 1 below 5 is because the f/x ain't all that great.

No big deal, Amazon made the return quick and easy. Here's the problem. When we received the replacement we noticed that the lid and casserole don't match up perfectly. We thought this was a defect since le crueset products are top of the line and typically have a tight lid to base seal which is part of what makes them so great. Before returning this one too we did some research and found that this piece was not defective. Even on le cruesets website you can see this lid base gap in the photos, but only from the right angle and on specific colors. Most le crueset products are top of the line pieces that will cook beautifully and last a lifetime and then some. This piece is not one of those. It is a brittle, breakable, sloppily made piece. Most le cruesets are expensive but worth it. This one is not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Notes from a teacher","review":"This series is a great series to use in the middle school/high school classroom. For the first time my students were actively engaged. They couldn't wait until the next time and they even asked to read longer. Darcy and her friends are characters that explore race, relationships, single parenthood, and many other aspects of life. It was great to find books that my minority students could really relate to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost and Found: To good to put down!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1","review":"This book is one of the best books i read in a while i'm looking foward to reading the whole series. Darcy a smart girl experience troubles that she tries to over come.Darcy is lost will she ever find herself? This book reminds me of a typical black teenager growing up in the hood. Well worth the money and time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Character You Can Care About","review":"In Lost and Found Darcy deals with problems that many teenagers face - friends, school, younger sisters, single working mom. But she also has the added burden of living with and caring for a grandmother she loves who is suffering from dementia. She must handle her anger and hurt regarding a father that left the family five years before. Then, there's the stalker who shows up in unusual places. Is he the one who left the threatening note?I jumped right into this story and worried about how Darcy would survive all of these problems. The obstacles were realistic, as were the solutions, which didn't come quickly or easily.I think this book is a wonderful read for its intended audience - teens who want a quick read that they can get lost in.I received this book in a giveaway from the Goodread's First Reads program."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Did Not Perform As Advertised.","review":"Our white haired dog developed a yeast infection -- a very common cause of tearing andd staining.

Dark lyrics and enchanting musical talent provide for a amazing album. This album is a great display of beautiful music, mixed with stunning vocals. Each track has its own unforgettable story. Though this band has been compared to others such as; Evanescence, Lacuna Coil and The Gathering, they surly do not fit the form, they exceeds it. Unfinished Thought is original and shows that music can still be beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bag for the Money","review":"This canvas type bag was taken on vacation to a beach resort and the sturdiness was amazing.

This book clearly PROVES that this was not (and is not today) the case. Ms Tarbell is REAL American womanhood -- she just went out and did her job and NUTS to the suffragists. Good for her! Splendid book and non PC. Where can you beat it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A-maze-ing!","review":"From the first page, I was hooked on this book. A few pages later, I laughed at Killian's \\"literary appetite\\" and pitied his situation. Soon, you learn about Rick's problems. Because his life was endangered in a juvenile detention center, he embarked on a journey across the Southwest. He met Lon, a bird biologist who became like a father to him. I'm not a \\"nature girl\\" who often reads stories with male protagonists, but I immensely enjoyed \\"Maze\\". There were beautiful descriptions of the majestic landscape and an engaging plot. I wonder what'll happen to Rick in the future; however, dreaming up the outcome of a character's situation is part of the fun of reading a cliffhanger book. To anyone who loves tales of adventure with edge-of-your-seat suspense, I reccomend this book. My New Year's resolution: read more Will Hobbs books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Young Adults will love the adventure and excitement!","review":"I'm reading some of Will Hobbs' books for a graduate class I am taking. The Maze is so full of adventure and excitement, I couldn't put it down! Young adults will love the Canyonlands setting which is perfect for the elements of exploration and danger. What I loved most about the book was how 14 yr. old Rick's interests were so similar to Lon's, the bird biologist he befriends. The releasing and tracking of the endangered condors, and the hang-gliding lessons, were a real plus to the storyline. I particularly appreciated the author notes at the end, which included a websight for those who want further information on condors. An excellent read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of action, plus good characters","review":"This book kept my interest all the way through, mostly because I liked the character Rick and saw how unfairly everyone had treated him. Plus, you learn a lot about condors and hang gliding when Rick solves a mystery involving two vicious intruders. I really liked the suspense and all the action."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Maze","review":"This book was not very interesting. It was really confusing. It was about a boy named Rick who to a detention center for throwing rocks at a stop sign. If you want to get bored then read the Maze. ( It might be interesting to you it is an adventure book!!!!!!!!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Boxes","review":"Ii liked this book beacuse it was a action packed thriller.Ii liked the part when the little creatures jumed out of the box and hide in the dark ,that part scared me alot. I also liked the part when when the girl opened the box even though it was seeled shut by metal.This book was so scary and good i never put it down. I hope they make a sequal."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Maze","review":"I really liked this book. I liked the details it had. It was very suspenceful, which made me want to keep reading it. I liked the ending it didn't just leave you hanging like most books."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK, but a little boring in some areas.","review":"If I could split stars, then I would give this book 4 and a half stars because I think it deserves more just 4. However, even though the plot has a nice twist with the hang gliding and endangered birds the storyline gets a little boring after a while. Why? Well, because the book contains to many boring subjects that I don't care about. It would of been fine if the author didn't mentoin these things and just stayed on topic.Overall, good book and not a bad read. I reccomend it to all those fans of Wilson Rawls and action/adventure books. If intrested in neither, this probably isn't a book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"dvd","review":"I love this movie.

I've watched it over a dozen times","review":"A Low Down Dirty Shame is a great movie that pays homage to the blaxploitation films of the 70's. Keenan Ivory Wayans does a great job of mixing action and humor in this cool detective story about a PI looking for $20 million in stolen drug money. The supporting cast is very good here; Jada Pinkett and Salli Richardson aren't just eye candy, they give good performances too. However the only fault is with the film is Charles S. Dutton who overacts as usual. ALDDS is a great popcorn movie that will leave you smiling.

In the beginning of the book, they explain the rating system very thouroughly. Once you understand the rating system, it becomes easier to read the descriptions of the camp grounds.Also a bonus (to me) are the literally thousands of ads on nearly every page. It's kind of like the yellow pages of the camping world.They don't give a lot of detail about the campgrounds. Just the pertinent information as it pertains to the ratings. However, there is always a way to contact the campground, usually via email (which works fine for me).We are planning a trip to Cherokee, NC this summer. This guide helped us narrow down the field to around five campgrounds out of over 25.Not the definitive resource, but definitely the starting place for most camping adventures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kanye cannot Flow!!!","review":"Kanye should stick to just making compilation albums with other rappers rhyming over his beats. I give 2 stars because Kanye has some hot beats, but his Flow is wack! Ive always noticed he uses that ur and dur type words for rhyming. Kanye please stick to producing, thats were you shine best. Start signing some cats to your record label and get that doe! peace!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I hate his personality but not music.","review":"On MTV and Bet he always mouth off at the camera crew for no reason. He did this twice on MTV. I let it slide, but on bet too. I guess he is a serious person but he gotta control his temper. Some fans could get offended and he lose them forever. I heard most of college dropout and from hearing diamonds I can see that he matured much more. He did step a notch up, because if he go too far it would sound boring. It's funny because he dresses preppy, and have a real personality, like he know a lot about the streets. It's never been done before and he pulled it off. I'll keep liking his music but if his personality worsens then I'mma think he's wack. Becareful who you get smart with. Me and him would be fighting everyday."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is that real Hip Hop right here!!","review":"I'm not gonna lie- this album is amazing. The productions on Late Registration are phenomenol and Jon Brion is the perfect collaborator for Kanye. Touch the Sky just makes you wanna dance and Gold Digger is something to get down to. I really like the sound Addiction has with it and Heard 'Em Say is sweet with Adam Levine. Gone is a hot track too, so is Diamonds (obviously). Kanye's lyrics are just as good as on Dropout if not better. This is innovative and that's something hip hop today lacks, so if you want the real deal, Late Registration's got it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true clasic. Headed in the right direction.","review":"This is the album of 2005....I would have given it 5 stars but we have to take innto to consideration this is only his second album. For an album to be dubed \\"a hip hop clasic\\" an artist must show an improvement in content, dilivery, the ability to keep up with the beat and how the artist chooses to keep up with the beat. Kanye was great when he first came out with college drop out, and he still managed to improve dramatically but he has yet to be able to stake his claim and sit at the round table of greats. He is on his way. This album has certified Kany as a true lyrical genius. One more album like this and he could be the one to take over Jay-Z's spot. DO NOT SLEEP ON THIS ALBUM. THIS IS REAL HIP HOP. \\"That is Real Talk\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"ALLS I HAVE TO SAY IS THIS IS GOOD MUSIC","review":"i don't care if you're a rap fan or not, this is some good music. I love the symphony type background in his tracks. My friends don't like it cause they want their G-unit and other mainstream garbage. They can have it , I'm a real fan of music and I say that this is the best rap CD I have ever heard. The Grammys won't lie. This is for people that love music not just for some brick heads that listen to the popular crap. All of you that agree with me you are smart if not you're probably the brick head I was talking about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliance","review":"This album is very good listin to it for youself . The below posters attempting to hate not sure why. The album is a classic and defintely worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Beats This time around","review":"What I really like about this album is that Kanye has a lot of songs that feature different artists. This brings a much needed contrast from Kanye's boring old voice. Personally, I cant stand his voice, because he basically talks in every damn song, but not in a rapping way. Good songs include Heard 'Em Say, Diamonds From Sierra Leone, Bring Me Down. The beats are also really excellent this time, but this album does not get 5 stars simply because of Kanye's stale voice. It is also very clear that a lot more effort was put into the quality of the music, as it is very creative and refreshing"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks horribly","review":"Go away Kanye and 50, we need those spaces for the next flavor of the month rappers.I can't stand Kanye.

What kind of dumbass types in ebonics?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Heard It all Before!","review":"Worthless album! Listening to this is like tuning your radio to the past, listening to some dudes rapping over old music. Kayne has to step up his game, his style is getting boring and predictable.

But this crap will sell because there's really nothing eles to offer in the rap industry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoulda been later!","review":"was expecting more from kanye's sophmore album but didnt live up to its hype theres like only 3 cool songs on the cd 2 beings his singles."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am person who loves underground hip hop","review":"I can see why this album is so loved in the mainstream, because he does rap about other things then being gangster. If you think hes the first to do it, your stupid. There is nothing great about this guy at all, and people think its amazing because its not like every other rapper in the mainstream. Well if you listen to Deltron, Jedi Mind Tricks, Aesop Rock, Atmosphere, MF Doom, Quasimoto, and Mobb Deep, well than you understand why this guy is a dumb ass. This guy gets off on his image so much its sad. If you love hip hop do yourself the favor of checking out any of the artiest I just named. In the underground most rappers are rapping about something other than being gangster and it is nothing new."},{"rating":"2","title":"omg.........just pure excellent talent","review":"Thank God for Dame Dash not ignoring great talent like this...Kanye will be def apart of the future...This album and the last are both fire.....I like the fact that he is so confident about himself and he has a right to be....Everyone person should own this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absoultely Amazing","review":"When I first heard \\"College Dropout\\", I thought Kanye could not make another album that good but I was wrong.

So don't sleep and cope this album"},{"rating":"1","title":"I just don't get it....","review":"Why do people love this guy so much? I honestly have never liked even one of his songs. He is terrible. Go listen to a song like Diamonds and ask yourself is that really \\"rap\\"? Kanye West's music is way more pop than rap. I just wish my man Biggie and 2Pac were still here so we could listen to some real rap music from people with actual talent. Don't support talentless people like Kanye West. If you want to buy a real rap CD buy Ready to Die, the debut masterpiece by the late great Notorious B.I.G.Kanye sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kanye sells out","review":"I loved College Dropout. Dope, dope album. Remember when Kanye compared himself to Tribe? WTF happened Kanye? His ego took over and in his quest to attain classic status he made a generic new-school, overly commercial rap album that is just plain terrible. Alright there's a few good songs on here but NONE of them are as good as the stand-out tracks from Dropout. Thanks for putting another nail in hip-hop's coffin Kanye, props."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't like him","review":"Kanye West is very arrogant and needs to come off his high horse! He acts as if somebody owes him something. I don't like him as a person, so naturally i don't like his music. Never have and never will. The way he starts behaving around Grammy time makes me sick. What is his favorite saying\\" If I dont win it's going to be problems\\"! Dude your music aint all that and on top of that he samples alot! Come up with your own stuff instead of using everybody's stuff from the old school. Late registration was listened to while i was riding with my boyfriend in his car and I only liked one song:1. Drive slow ( i love paul wall)Kanye needs to realize that there a alot of talented artists that don't always win the Grammy's even though they deserved it, For example India Arie she deserved all 9 of them grammys she was nominated for, but she didn't even win not a one, but you didn't see her acting stupid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"arrogance in a cd","review":"kayne claims to have an 150 IQ but when it gets right down to it,his IQ is really no different than the people who like him.oh sure kayne claims that \\"bush don't like black people\\" despite the fact that bush has been taken footage of hunging black people and kissing them sounds to me like kayne needs to watch that footage and realize what an ass he isalso this guy is extremtly racist through out his album using slurs againist whiteshe also DWELLS on the college subject and keeps on pretending to be \\"poor\\"he NEVER WAS POOR his momma has a PH.D!he claims to be a \\"born again christian\\" yet if he truely was he'd stop using slurs,stop blaming others and use religion in the right waybut kayne will clearly go to hell for this albumskip this album and go get tupuc or biggie or eminem people with much more talent then this idiot kaynethis guy will be on shows wondering his whereabouts after he ends up being thrown out of the fishbowl"},{"rating":"1","title":"one word.....garbage","review":"Ever had blood profusely Oozing from your ears????

You know those times where you just need a hug from mom, well after I listened to this CD it was one of those times. So in all, grabbing some 100 grit sandpaper and rubbing one out till bleeding or chaffing occurs would be more pleasurable than listening to this CD.

I say that because despite his temporary lasting power in the past few years, people ( of all races and musical preferences ) get tired of people trying to be so over the top and likable, because they ultimately seem fake. Hooking up with adam levine of maroon 5? some people might see that as a creative and daring technique for Kanye, but I see it as a pathetic attempt to reach out to any audience he can - Kanye is so greedy and conceited that I don't see how any self-respecting rap or music fan can give him the attention he so blatantly claims he deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"sucks","review":"The only person that is stupid enough to like Kanye West's poor excuse for music or existance for that matter is Kanye West."},{"rating":"2","title":"DON't BELIEVE THOSE REPUBLICANS, THIS ALBUM IS GREAT!!!","review":"Kanye West was simply outstanding on this album. I will say that it is very different from what we all are used to hearing, but that's the beauty of it. It may take a couple of times for you to listen to one song but i loved it after i got used to this new fantastic style of rap.I mean all of his lyrics have a meaning, like in \\"Roses\\", not many rappers can do that now-a-days. And \\"Addiction\\", i would say is one of the most interesting beats you've ever heard. I love music this is the album to get. and at the end of \\"roses\\" you may be able to point out Patti Labelle, and at the end of \\"Crack Music\\" you may be able to point out Charlie Wilson's voice, plus The Game is on there.

KanYe definitely brought out some memorable tracks: Heard 'Em Say, Touch the Sky, Gold Digger, Drive Slow, Roses, Addiction, Diamonds from Sierra Leone ft. Jay-Z, Hey Mama, and Celebration to name a few. Late Registration is a great sophomore album to The College Dropout. Keep bringing the hits, Mr. West!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jon Brion adds a lot","review":"I'm not a big fan of most hip hop out there, but this is an awesome album. Jon Brion added a lot with the music behind the raps, and the rhymes themselves are awesome. A few of the songs in the middle seem to drag on a little aimlessly, but none aren't worth listening to.

A case of the emperor's new clothes? The guy is a decent producer, but as an \\"artist,\\" he sucks big time. I mean, really. He can't sing, can't rap, can't put a basic melody together. If you ever see him perform on TV, it's just awful, really embarrassing, you want to look away, but you can't, like a car accident. There are so many other worthy, talented performers out there just waiting to be supported on radio, in record stores, and online. Don't give another dime to Kanye's alread-bloated wallet. He doesn't deserve it. My CD will now function as a drink coaster. This is tuneless, flat, tired garbage sold as ghetto-fab lifestyle on MTV as per usual. Ka-ching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kanye needs to lose the ego","review":"So I kept reading all the articles saying how great Kanye said his album are, and how he \\"deserves to with album of the year\\" and his \\"songs are instant classics\\". My curiosity was sparked...What a dissappointment. I was expecting something amazing, but this was crap! Maybe it was over-hyped, I'm not sure.Also, the fact that Kanye is so arrogant and stuck on himself, it makes me hate him and this album even more. The only reason it got 1 sate is because no stars is not an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont believe the hype-","review":"Whoa Whoa Whoa!!! When did everyone jump on the Kanye West bandwagon?? Dont get me wrong, I think his first album is tremendous and still listen to it constantly. But I honestly wasnt impressed with first single \\"Diamonds (From Sierra Leone)\\" and apparently neither were many fans. The song did not do well and I thought oh well. Then when the album was released and critics hailed it as possibly the best album of the year, followed by the release of \\"Gold Digger\\"; I changed my mind immediately and bought the album. Expecting songs that jump out like \\"Digger\\" and even stuff similiar to 'College Dropout' I was highly disappointed from the first spin. With exceptions like \\"Touch the Sky\\"(ft Lupe Fiasco) and \\"Digger\\", I found myself hitting the skip button more than the play button on my stereo; not even Jay-Z's appearance on the album could help this one out. So go ahead, throw a hissy fit like Kanye at the Grammy's, but I'm telling you this: Don't believe the hype!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all that","review":"I borrowed this cd from a friend and I didnt like it. It annoys me when he raps and he cant seem to catch his breath. At times he sounds like he just came back from running a marathon and recorded the album right after. He samples tooooo much. I mean its ok to sample here and there once in a while but he just does it too much. Dude, get your own music. The song goldigger was cool for about a week but then it just got old too fast. His lyrics are cool though, but I heard somewhere that he doesnt write his own lyrics. Maybe its just rumors, I dunno.

This is the biggest flopp to date. Kanye made a bad mistake by his comments infront of the press. Now his CD is just as bad as his comments! His beats are weak at best, his lyrics have nothing to say, he is saying the same stuff that was said in his last album, GET OFF THE COLLEGE SUBJECT, ITS TIME TO GROW UP AND MOVE FORWARD, his hooks are sorry and non-existant. Kanye West is just another rapper. He does not have the ability to make everyone stop and think about what he is saying like groups/artists dating all the way back to the bettles, Elvis, Bob Marley, 2Pac, The Notorious BIG, Eminem and Kayne's mentor Jay-Z. If you love rap and music in general and are looking for a GREAT artist, then Kanye West is not for you. His Sophomore album is a flopp from his Freshmen album and I think he should not even have showed up for late registration and in fact stayed back a year as a freshmen."},{"rating":"1","title":"poseur: an overblown self important hack","review":"This guy is terrible.

There are a lot of appearances from other artists which takes this album up another notch. As we all know, kanye's beats have that unique feel to them and this album is no different.

This is definitely an album to grab."},{"rating":"2","title":"Growing on Me","review":"As a white, middle-aged mother of 3, I am the last person you would expect to listen to this CD, but it is really growing on me. I love West's voice and when I heard Gold Digger, I had to hear the rest of his stuff. Like most rap, West's lyrics tend to be misogynist for the most part; but, he manages to make commentary on male/female relationships with an equal jab at both. He surprised me with some of his sharp political critique, like \\"Crack Music,\\" which rails U.S. white America for its long history of crimes against the black community and especially its leaders. I keep the unedited version away from the kids, because the lyrics are pretty explicit. I am still finding songs that I like, and I will definitly buy more of his stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real music","review":"All I got to say is, I'm from the Chi reppin to the fullest. I'm proud of Kanye. I got both of his CD's, and I'm very pleased. Finally we have artists making music that people really want to hear. Some real sh@t! Artists that's actually speaking about things that the average person experiences. Music with real live instruments and not just the computerized typed beats. I love Common and John Legend. The collaboration of all three is a breath of fresh air. Anyone who thinks less is hating big time. Like the two negative reviews on here. You can't even give a good legitmate reason why you think the album is bad. Because your hearing is being tuned out by the constant hating. Kanye, is a very talented artist, and it has been noted. That's why he has 6 grammys. So the majority wins. Haters find another hobby before you give yourself a headache."},{"rating":"2","title":"You dont have to like HIM but you gotta love his talent,","review":"This is the freshest most original hip-hop album I have heard since Camp Lo-uptown Saturday Night. He touches on areas that most rappers have either been scared or have not had the insight Kanye West posseses. As for his attitude and demeanor this is not a review on that. He is a prodigy in the studio and I have a feeling he will only get better with time. I dont think he is going to have to worry about Grammys anymore, in the next few years he will be using them as doorstops due to sheer excess. Big Ups to Kanye and this is for sure 5 mic worthy!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kayne west - late registration","review":"when kanye first hit the mainstream with \\"thru the wire\\", I knew he was going to be a success. hip-hop was in a state it had never been in before, when everything was so commercial it would make n*sync green with envy. needless to say, \\"thru the wire\\" and it's follow-up single, \\"jesus walks\\", were a huge step away from the normal hip-hop club bangers. However, \\"the college dropout\\" was you typical bait and switch hip-hop record, with two or three deep thinkers, and 14 \\"club bangers\\". Now, in 2005, kayne has followed up his successful debut with more of the same. Although some of the songs on this record are \\"deep thinkers\\", most go the way of commercial emcee, with tired lines about money, cars, women and \\"ice\\". I know kanye could write an album on a par with someone like nas, pac or Krs, but he won't, because money always comes first. Mainstream hip-hop is dead, and so goes with it all the talents that used to run the game. enjoy your nelly, people."},{"rating":"2","title":"This kid is def...","review":"Late Registration is the best hip-hop album to debut in 2005.

I like every song on here except for the very last track but the rest over power that easily. To the haters that are saying that he is way overrated f**k you I mean why are saying that maybe because you are a Tony Yahoe fan and mad because this album had over a hundred reviews on the first day of release and is already platinum and the gay unit fans are pissed because one member is not getting attention. Oh well do not listen to them this album is well worth the money and better then all the rap album that have been released this year so hurry and buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Sophmore Release","review":"I bought and listened to entire album on Tuesday and I thought that it was a phenominal work.

Kanye has a lot of artists on the album. The best song is \\"Gold Digger\\" faet, Jaimee Fox. He goes off with Paul Wall, Maroon 5 , Jay-Z , and more.

Kanye uses different kind of beats than what you would usually hear in hiphop and it works!!All the songs on this cd are either Awesome or good and the beats are just amazing.

Buy it now!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Late Registration","review":"This cd is HOT!!! It is not as good as College Dropout in that some of the songs on Late Registration sound the same. There are four skits and they're all hilarious, but after a while you start to think that they are fillers. Back to the songs, they are all pretty hot. It starts off with some feel-good music(Ex:\\"Heard Em Say\\" & \\"Touch the Sky\\"). The middle of the cd are mostly songs that send messages (Ex:\\"Crack Music\\" & \\"Roses\\") Then he goes out with a bang (Ex: \\"We Major\\" & \\"Hey Mama\\"). Overall the cd is hot and well worth buying. My top 5 songs in that order are:1.Roses-great song for his grandma2.Diamonds(remix) ft. Jay-Z-better than the original3.Hey Mama-song for his mom4.Addiction-catchy song that has a good chorus5.Gold Digger-kind of pop-ish but i like Jamie Foxx singing the chorus"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kanye West Probably The Best","review":"I enjoyed every song on the CD and recently installed a sound system in my truck so I'm enjoying it all over again.

Let me tell you this album is a must have and THE album of the year. Kanye may not be on the lyrical level of a Nas or Immortal Technique but he does great work with what he has. This is commercial album yes but with substance and a strong since of value. This isn't some Album especially made for MTV TRL and that sorta thing. Personally I thought it would be a commercial album with no value and I was very wrong. He has elevated and transformed the rap and Hip-Hop game once again. In one word I'll describe this cd Classic. Those that doubt it don't hate on it before you listen to EVERY TRACK."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it. But then again I'm over 25.","review":"I find it very difficult to really get into Kanye's rapping style. I try, and try, and try. I fail to understand what the appeal is. I agree with many reviewers that the beats are great. However lyrically, Dr. Suess writes better rhymes. Incidentally, they both sell entertainment to the same demographic.Mr. West may not be much of a rapper, however, he appears to be a great businessman. It used to mean something when you protested a president or a war. Now the face of the anti-war counterculture drives Bentlys and drinks Moet. One thing is certain: He does a great job of selling albums.

I remember this had to be one of the biggest albums to come out during my sophomore year in hs. Gold Digger was a huge smash, Diamonds are Forever an excellent track(and my 2nd favorite Kanye Song), and Heard em say was an excellent song. I really liked Adam Levine's vocals and thought the video was creative and different. Touch the sky was a great song. It's got a nice groove to it, and the video cracks me up. Overall, I'd say this is his best album that's he came out with. All the tracks are very strong and there's very little filler on this cd. I really thought a hidden gem by Kanyew was Roses. It's an excellent sample and he did justice to the orginial by making it his own. If your a fan of R and b music then this is the album for you to get. It's def. worth buying. I did get tired of it being overplayed, but a few years later I think it's a pretty good album."},{"rating":"2","title":"DOPE!!!","review":"The Best Rapper/Producer in the game!!!!!!!!!!!

There was, and still is, so much hype about it and to be completely honest, it's not what they say it to be.His debut album, College Dropout was excellent, and he deserved all of the acclaim for it, but this here is something different. This is so lackluster and boring. Seems like he gave his best beats away, because Late Registration's production is very lazy. Jon Brion might have done miracles for Fiona Apple, but Kanye, no.To all reading this, I'm not even trying to hate. I was a big Kanye fan, but this album is definitely his worst material and a sophmore slump. So as you see it on the \\"Top Albums of 2005\\" and the fact that it's two times platinum, just know that this, in my opinion, is not worth any of the hype. Get a better album, of his first one, as an alternative gift to Late Registration this season.-Nathaniel"},{"rating":"2","title":"good effort kanye","review":"I haven't been into hip hop since the 90's at all but I somehow ended up getting this CD and enjoy the beats and the lyrics.

I'm tired of the culture and the media that glorifies them. I'm tired of useless worthless rappers who come out and own the world's attention for 15 minutes before fading from view altogether only to be replaced by the next flavor of the month.

Case in point is the song \\"Diamonds from Sierra Leone.\\" Sure the beat is terrific and I love that sample that serves as the song's refrain, but the lyrics really get to me. A song titled \\"Diamonds from Sierra Leone\\" seems like the perfect way to make some good social commentary on the human injustices that are the result of the diamond trade in the African country of Sierre Leone, but West seems too concerned with rapping about how rich he is, how big his hits are, how wrong critics were about his music, to bother with all that stuff. The only thing I learned from this song is that he's got a Porshe, was nominated for some Grammies, is better than everyone else, etc. Bravo, Kanye, in one song you've managed to demonstrate just how far hip-hop has strayed from its roots of social commentary to end up at its current state of complete narcissism and irrelevence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kanye West Delivers","review":"First I would state that Kanye West was is NOT A RACIST.But the fact is George Bush \\"Does Care\\" about all Americans.

The rest of the album is bland, while being somewhat creative but uneven... it left me very unfulfilled.There are many better rap cds, mostly released in 1996-2001, but this cd is strictly average. I am sick of seeing Kanye on tv, magazine covers, etc. because he is OVERRATED. It's not like he sucks, but he is no Pac, BIG, Jay-Z, Eminem, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sux!","review":"1.

Fortunatly, there are a few cuts on here that are tight, & I emphasize \\"few\\". Deffinitly listen to it before you buy, it's one of those BEYOND overated albums. If you want some real hip hop, & not just this commercial garbage, go check out someone from Project Blowed or even Fort Minor, which really surprised me. It's real hip hop, coming from a guy, who some would diss for being in a rock/rap hybrid group. Keep in mind, I'm not here to back Kanye, I'm just pointing out what I hear. I listen to ALOT of hip hop, & I also flip by the radio from time to time, & this album, for the most part, just sounds like your average commercial rap album, maybe with less bling."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 grammys,are you serious?","review":"I was absolutely livid and furious when I saw this JERK steal 3 grammys.This dork is amongst the worst rappers of all time and this is as lousy as music can get.OVERRATED WITH A CAPITAL O.AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE.ZERO STARS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Puffy/Diddy Lite","review":"Kanye West aka Kon Man Least doesn't do much for me musically. dude can't Rap,same ole Sped up trick with Sampling,Looping&speeding up vocals that was cool back in 1985. I give Him Hustle Points,but as a Artist He is Vastly Overrated&I gotta believe He spent some of His Album Budget at buying off Magazines,Radio,etc... because the Cuts on here are just basically Poor Rehases of His Debut Album. I can tolerate His contradictions as a Writer,but certain things are repeated to the point that it just gets so boring. if His Music was matched His Ego then I could see Him getting some of the Hype He gets.but getting the cover of \\"Time\\" Magazine behind another Average album is a Bit much.He basically reminds me of a Poor Man's Puffy/Diddy with a bit more Musicality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way to be late, and not have your homework either","review":"We waited on the delay for this? Another overrated drop from the ROC. How about something without samples for each song? He outdid himself with the first album, and there is no way that this will ever top it. It must have been too good to be true, knowing that he was voted the most unlikely to succeed in the ROC. This album is mediocre, played out old samples that are just rapped over.

He is a pretty cocky and confident person, but his music doesnt show it; he sounds like a pansy to me. But if you like the softer sounding rappers, then Kanye is for you. He does have a couple of songs that actually made my head bob and got me singing along, but they are only the songs that are already out for singles.The songs sound awesome, different moods; but they arent hip hop moods. It is more like pop than anything else.Not a BAD album, very different. but not worth the $$"},{"rating":"1","title":"We hate this bigot","review":"Blue Racer: This guy claims to love everyone yet he hates white people.

I wore that CD out like nobody's business. Even though my interest in Kanye waned as his tremendous ego took over his personality, I was still eagerly anticipating the release of Late Registration. Knowing the extent of Kanye's potential, I figured he would get me to like him again. I was wrong.This insipid garbage is barely listenable. The tracks are super overproduced, this from someone who claimed to mix down Diamonds from Sierra Leone 17 times. The production overpowers the basic, boring, bland lyrics, which might just be a good thing. His arrogance is clear as he extrapolates the beat forever after the verses are complete. The only standout song on there is \\"Hey Mama,\\" which is certainly not appropriate for everyday listen.I gave the ambitious man two stars for the production and lyrics that were actually passable, but I could never think of giving him more. He certainly didn't give me more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thief","review":"Kanye West is one of the most arrogant and egotistical artists alive. And why???

He can't rhyme, and his lyrics arent deep they're rant-like. Instead of being creative and making a strong intellectual point he just goes on with lame rhyming 'skills' and we all praise him because hes on tv so hey.. he must be great right? People dont realize the only reason hes good is because hes on tv, hes not making videos and albums BECAUSE hes good, he has the money of course hes going to. Hip hop is in a reallllllly sad state right now, its turned from inspirational and deep lyrics to beats that just happen to have lyrics over them, and we dont realize that its not the lyrics we like, its the beat.

There was, and still is, so much hype about it and to be completely honest, it's not what they say it to be.His debut album, College Dropout was excellent, and he deserved all of the acclaim for it, but this here is something different. This is so lackluster and boring. Seems like he gave his best beats away, because Late Registration's production is very lazy. Jon Brion might have done miracles for Fiona Apple, but Kanye, no.To all reading this, I'm not even trying to hate. I was a big Kanye fan, but this album is definitely his worst material and a sophmore slump. So as you see it on the \\"Top Albums of 2005\\" and the fact that it's two times platinum, just know that this, in my opinion, is not worth any of the hype. Get a better album, of his first one, as an alternative gift to Late Registration this season.-Nathaniel"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kanye does it again!!!!","review":"Kanye West drops his solid sophomore release Late Registration. This CD is full of great Kanye produced tracks. Guest rappers include Common,The Game,Jay-Z,Jamie Foxx,Paul Wall, Nas and others. Other producers on this CD are Just Blaze and Jon Brion, who has never worked on a rap CD before but shines on his track productions. The key songs on this CD are, Gold Digger, Diamonds from Sierra Leone, We Major, and Hey Mama. My personal favorites are, Heard em Say, Gold Digger, and Drive Slow. I didnt think Kanye could make another album that could possibly be better than College Dropout but he proved here he can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Late Registration","review":"I really like this CD...usually i only like one or two more well known songs on a rap CD, although I found that i liked just about all of the songs on Kanyes CD"},{"rating":"1","title":"good music, but .................","review":"the idea is great, this serie of 14 cd albums brings back the more unknown black dance music from the 80's in the 12\\" versions.Digitally remastered, but they forget to tell you that they remastered from the vinyl singles not from the original mastertapes.

The great thing about this book is it will explain everything you need to know but encourage you to skip ahead if you don't want to get into the details of each particular phase.

This book has been responsible for two successful batches so far and the end to end process is very easy to follow. I also tried one recipe from it and it turned out rather good.

Exercise problems have little or no relevance to the chapters they belong to, and often other books or sources are required just to decipher the meaning of the questions or to borrow intuition from to solve them. Prose is extremely terse, ineffective, and incomplete. It seems as though the author just didn't care enough to make the book readable or usable. Goldberg makes the reader have to work excessively hard to gain any kind of interesting or important information. This book appears to just be another example of a badly written book in an entire field of badly written material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Despair all who have to use this book","review":"This is possibly one of the worst textbooks I have ever read. I had to use this book in a graduate level econometrics class and found it very difficult to follow: poorly written, counterintuitive, and with a confusing choice of statistical notation. We only used about the first half of the book. A much better book is Rice's Mathematical Statistics and Data Analysis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark and Ponderous","review":"I'm afraid I was disappointed by this first volume in a series which is already projected to 5 volumes. The plot background, basically a reverse v'ger with an ounce or two of X-files, unfolds in truly tedious fashion. Action occurs in short jerky motions. Tunnel chases get interrupted for philosophical soliliquies, etc. Conspiracy lovers will have a ball, however. The writer picks up on all the old theories and adds dashes of aliens where you would never expect them. Literally nothing is as it seems. If you like dark, baroque, excrutiatingly complex settings this will be a series you might come to love. Our best hope here is that this ponderous writing is corrected in later volumes by other authors and that the core story becomes a rich source of invention. In the meantime, I'm pretty sure you will have to read volume 1 to be able to follow what's coming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read the Comments.","review":"I am not going to even try to compete with the rest of the reviewers that really seem to be taking this \\"reviewing\\" stuff seriously. Yet, I have to say that most of them are pretty substantive and correct. This is not an easy read. Simon's prose is verbose and difficult to get through, but he's certainly no Hegel or Kant. It certainly is doable, but you have to be really serious and you already should possess a great deal of knowledge about the French Revolution. If you're new to the subject I'd recommend picking up some easier books to start with. If you begin with Simon, you're almost certain to get frustrated and discouraged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chronicle","review":"Chronicle is right. Even for a historical it was overly analytical. Dated and full of useless information about a very important time in french/world history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unless you're a Harvard History graduate don't bother.","review":"This highly regarded book has to be the biggest let down I've read in 10 years. The prose is mind numbingly dull and over intricate and you're left with the feeling that Schama wrote it to impress his Columbia University collegues with his oh-so brilliant depth of knowledge. The books biggest fault is Schama's unwillingness to dare to condescend and explain anything, he just takes for granted that you understand the doctrines of Voltaire and Rousseau and other notable people and institutions, and has the annoying habbit of breaking into French phrase without giving any translation. This book with its intricacies could be quite usefull to someone with an already deep knowledge of the subject, albeit being a revisionist piece, but to the person with a casual interest its just a big fat, expensive waste of paper.JD"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I spent 5 months dragging myself through the endless pages of this terrible book. I don't know how he managed to make such an interesting topic such a cure for insomnia. Schama's greatest fault is his lack of information. For hundreds of pages he wanders from topic to topic with no coherent link to any of them, or any apparent order. You can skip the first 500 pages and not miss much. After that, it gets a bit more exciting, and a bit better organized, but it still isn't very well-written, and it doesn't even come close to being concise. Not worth the money to buy it or the time to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent updated history of the French Revolution","review":"This is the definite volume for students of the French Revolution. Schama is not afraid to take on some of the earlier historians and lambaste them for their obvious condoning of some of the most horrific violence of this extremely bloody time. Schama lets the facts simply speak for themselves and involves the reader to make up his or her own mind about who the true villains were. The chapters devoted to the incarceration of the Royal Family are quite moving and the downfall of Robespierre and his followers is presented in detail. Readers shouldn't be intimidated by the length of this book. There are very few dull moments in this volatile era and any history student will be thoroughly fascinated."},{"rating":"2","title":"The French Revolution - The Ripples Are Still Being Felt!","review":"The French Revolution - which began as a series of reforms and ended by devouring its leaders - was the first of the great upheavals on the continent. It is the subject here of history professor and popular historian Simon Schama, who has written another of his eminently readable books.The French Revolution was inspired by the American War of Independence, which the French supported as part of their continuing struggle with Great Britian. However, while the American leaders had a firm grasp on the principles of government and a good British model on which to build, the French were inspired by a different set of ideas and had little idea of exactly what would replace the Ancien Regime. Schama has a great eye for detail and a gift for narrative history, and this large-scale work is a deep exploration of the first great revolution of the left -one whose reverberations are still being felt to this day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slip sliding away","review":"The book got less readable as it went along, hence the \\"slip sliding away\\" title. I guess if you like detailed accounts of the goings-on at conventions, and assemblies this is the book for you. I found it tedious and boring once the revolution got started. The author loves French phrases with no definition given. I thought his style was pretentious and fussy. So, not a very good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be Open-minded (And Bring Your Thesaurus)","review":"First off, Simon Schama has a much broader vocabulary than most of us, so bring your thesaurus or dictionary when sitting down.My goal when picking up \\"Citizens\\" was to learn more about the French Revolution, something I had never studied in any depth. This book does have depth and beyond just reciting facts and figures, analyzes the men and women of the Revolution, and provides a view point on the events, often contradicting or expanding previous research and publications. I got a hell of a lot more out of \\"Citizens\\" than I ever expected. I now have a context of French Revolution not only within French History but how it compares to the American Revolution, English revolutionary struggles, and its influence on Bonaparte, the Soviets, and Europe as a whole.Sit down, bring your dictionary (and plenty of time - it took me over 10 years to pick it up and another year to read it!) and enjoy \\"Citizens\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good history book","review":"Very detailed history of the French Revolution, with a detailed examination of the myriad factors that caused it. Engaging and well written.My only criticisms would be that the huge number of names thrown at you can be a bit overwhelming - you're never sure whether a new name that is being introduced is one that you should take note of as it might pop up repeatedly, or whether it will just disappear as fast as it was mentioned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Examination of the Revolution","review":"This is a massive book (over 800 pages) that exhaustively examines the French Revolution. It has a large number of illustrations and maps that brings the text to life and while Doyle's History of the French Revolution may be more neutral, this book addresses areas not fully explored by Doyle.One of Schama's themes is that the common peasants did not desire liberty so much as protection from their landlords in the local courts and to preserve grazing rights. Had Louis been a little more assertive he could certainly have remained King of a constitutional monarchy. All in all a facinating read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece","review":"I have never read a book like this. After two readings in as many years, I am still haunted and provoked by this magnificent telling of the revolution. I am not an historian, and I cannot say whether Schama is biased to the left, right, up, or down. It does seem to me as if his uncompromising analysis of the facts and relentless attention to detail would stir up anyone comfortable in her understanding of this time. This book rocked my understanding of ALL revolutions, especially the Bolshevik in 20th century Russia. Schama's passion for justice and right drive a spike through the hypocritic hearts of both critics and apologists for the revolution, leaving us to sit amongst our own prejudices. The accumulation of detail provided here paints a devastating portrait of this complex time, and Schama's narrative brilliance drives the story forward with total conviction and fire. I love what this book reveals, and I love what it did to me, is still doing to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gem","review":"This paperback edition is almost 30 years old, yet I have never read anything so clear and sure-footed about the subjective world of awareness and unawareness. Virginia Satir's extended analogy, which is most of the book, delights and astonishes me: we see our sub-personalities as players in a theatre first introduced and then playing a particular drama and resolution that the author thinks it might help us to see - such effectiveness; simplicity and kindness is surely hard-won. I cannot respect it enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste!","review":"Compared to Baby Bargains, I thought this book was a total waste of time. It does not provide the depth of objective information i was looking for (and that Baby Bargains contains) such as comparisons to Consumer Reports and pointed feedback from a large cross section of parents, applicability of products to various lifestyles (city vs. suburban), or good options based on varying budget levels. It also does not provide the same level of information on where to find the products mentioned or alternatives for finding the same products at better prices.

Bt demonstrating the impact Tolkien's works have had on all aspects of our culture in a wide variety of ways it truly keeps you interested and amused while giving you alot to contemplate. Anyone from the casual fan of the LOTR movies to the book obsessives will find something to enjoy and the filmakers love of their subject is obvious. A movie made by fans, about fans, for the fans and as a fan I loved it...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough fans","review":"My one thing about this documentary is that it is called \\"Lord of the Fans\\" but the majority of it doesn't have your average everyday fan. I was hoping to see more of what I experienced and what I saw... but I didn't. They only went to one Line Party, and, in fact, they didn't even really talk about Line Parties all that much. Most of the interviewees were famous people with little tiny inserts from fans here and there. Most of the documentary part was overly cheesy and the graphics were rather mediocre. I was hoping for something more. I didn't get it.I actually had preordered this item, but someone I knew had a preview copy that I got to see and I cancelled my order after seeing it. I was not overly impressed. With all the hype I just thought it was going to be so much better. I didn't want another documentary that's like many that I already own. I was hoping for something fresh."},{"rating":"1","title":"More about the book then the fans","review":"I had such high hopes for this film. Beware anyone telling you it is about the recent fandom because very little in this film is about fans. Too much of it is interviews with the actors talking about how they feel about the books and how it inspires them and blah blah blah. It is also a history of Tolkein and his book starting from 1954. That part is ok but overblown and boring. I was going into this thinking it would be more along the like of Trekkies or Star Wait. I am not a trek fan nor a huge star wars fan but those two movies were so far above this one it's embarassing. From the title you expect this to be about the fans. Again...beware...there is very little about the actual fans or even about the movie. Huge disappointment"},{"rating":"1","title":"ZERO STARS!!!","review":"I had very high hopes for this movie, but I had to stop watching it at about the thirty-minute mark because I couldn't take one more second of the pseudo-psychedelic graphics, shots of fake hippies smoking pot and reading \\"the book\\", cheesey animation, self-serving interviews, and total lack of focus in the narration - not to mention the documentary itself.The extended version of (I believe) \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" has a documentary among the 'special features' that does perfectly what this film purports to do - tell the story of the LOTR phenomenon.Watch that instead of this sorry cinematic endeavor."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much better than \\"Trekkies\\"","review":"Cheers to the creators of \\"Ringers: Lord of the Fans\\" for bringing us such fun opportunity to wallow in Lord of the Rings fandom. A parade of famous names alongside a host of \\"average\\" (?) fans demonstrates the true universality of Tolkien's work, not just the appeal of the big screen epic. And it doesn't hurt to have Dominic Monaghan's lilting narration carry us through the decades of Lord of the Rings history.If you're a fan at all, this DVD will be worth getting just to see the Mariachi Merchandise sing-along. I'm looking forward to what are rumored to be some great extras features, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not about the books, but rather Hippie culture","review":"Ringers has some good moments, but on the whole it's probably not going to interest most LOTR fans. I love the books and the movies, but Ringers is mostly about pop culture, not the books and movies themselves. It talks about hippies, heavy metal songs, spoofs, and roadside attractions - but not the books or movies! I'd be interested in learning about the book's impact on U.S. politics and culture, but much of the documentary simply features stock footage of hippies dancing. Some parts are just dumb, like the homosexual fan fiction). It does have a few interesting interviews about the 1970s cartoon versions, but frankly it spends way too much time on these failed films. Overall, I was relieved when it was over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok Short Story","review":"This was an ok read to me it didn't really do it for me but it was an ok read for me to pass the time.

The author's purpose of writing the story is mainly to say to trust people even if you do not want to. The main characters in novel are Brisana Meeks, Darcy Wills, and Hakeem Randall. Darcy and Hakeem are dating and they think that trust is big factor in a relationship. Brisana Meeks is a trouble maker who loves to make people angry. My favorite character is Darcy because she learned to put her trust in people and let them learn to trust her. She also learned to forgive and forget all the hurtful things people have done to her. You can learn to relate to other people through the things they have been through. I would recommend this book to people who like to read romantic, suspenseful, and comedy books. I would also recommend this book to both male and female teenagers who like to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"a quick read but a good read","review":"This book was a good read although it is very short. The book is well worth it though. It basically tells about a young girl who once had a best friend that turned on her because she found a new group of friends she didnt like. Her boyfriend also plays a lead in this story as the young, talented, fine, Hakeem whom her so called best friend is after. the whole situation gets realy twisted, but in the end every thing happens for the good which tells you that not all sticky situations come off at the bottom of the pit.This is a good book for young teens who don't know about the outcomes of phonies in high school and how they should be the bigger person regardless of how rotten the other person treats them.Everyday life learned lessons are put into this book for young people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not thrilling at all.","review":"I found the first few short stories I read very dull and not thrilling in the least.

It certainly includes a lot of stories from a lot of writers, many of them famous. But I was disappointed. The stories are weak, compared to the novels of those writers I've read. One of the best stories is the first, by Lee Child, who is probably my current favorite thriller writer. Beyond that I would say there are three stories that really work out of the whole bunch. There must be 30 or so in all. It's a long wade through mediocrity to get to the good, and the good are just good, not great.

One finds proscuitto with melon all the way to caviar with baby swiss with many other varieties, tastes and spices between. Many and varied tastes are tempted by these bite sized stories. As others have compared this to the \\"Forrest Gumpish, box of chocolates\\" one knows these confections are neither sweet nor nutty after the first taste. These are true mysteries and thrillers of the first order with authors offering everything from two wonderful historical vignettes through detectives, spies, good scares, and even one Marxist theme spy story. This is a new genre of fiction and thereby gives teasers into these varied authors' style and flavor. This is not just an ordinary anthology of short stories or a digest version of longer novels. I find this a well-done must read and a most difficult book to describe to others. Readers must try this for themselves or miss a very tasty array."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks, or Thanks Alot!!!","review":"Yeah I bought it for some of the authors that I love, but....I never expected to be thrilled by all of them!

As if I didn't have enough to read already. I'm a bookaholic; one who buys more books that he can possibly get to read over the next 10 years, unless one sits and reads 24/7; then it may still be a challenge. Thanks to this collection of throughly engrossing, wonderfully imagined, and interesting stories, my wallet will grow thinner, my middle larger from lack of physical excercise, and the room that supports my personal library will have to be reinforced with steel beams to hold all these new books by all these new thriller writers that I will now have to read.

Not one story in this anthology wowed me. At best, the stories were mediocre and not exciting (bad for a thriller). and some seemed more like mysteries than thrillers.

The information may be helpful, but the way it is written is not helpful in the least. Instead of writing so that information, which many of us are learning for the first time, is manageable, Mendez writes in the most confusing of ways (using way to many Ps as well) ... On the plus side, the codes are written in the back of each chapter. I guess thats not much of a plus side, but I felt I should put something. Also each subject is painstakingly described throughout the chapters, even stuff that is not that important, and tends to get one sentence in one of the supplements... good luck and enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a Problem approach.","review":"This is the most painful legal book I have ever read. I am a third year law student in my last semester and have read dozens of law books. This book is written poorly and has the feel of someone trying to sound smart, but failing. The worst element of the book is the questions at the end of each section. It isn't a book of cases, which you might think is a good thing. But in the alternative you get dense poorly worded questions to march through in class. This book is certainly \\"a problem approach\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst of the Worst","review":"Wow. This is an unclear and confusing approach.

The characters are developed reasonably well, but the story line is pretty thin. The only real action or suspense occurs right at the end and only when the murderer is uncovered and confronted by the protagonist, Ben Reese. Maybe my expectations were too high, or maybe it's because this was the author's first mystery novel, but I found it quite dull and uninspiring. I probably would have put it down and not picked it up again if it had been a longer story. Contrary to another reviewer, I find this author has a long way to go before her mysteries can be likened to those of the greats such as Agatha Christie. Maybe the subsequent stories in the Ben Reese series are much better, but I was disappointed enough by this one that I probably won't be checking out that possibility."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun turn in Academia","review":"Ben Reese is my kind of character and Sally Wright is my kind of author. This book was a true mystery - you know the kind, the one that actually relies on the plot and clues to keep it going as opposed to the ones that try to thrill and scare you simply with blood and then all of the sudden they discover the murderer and it's someone you never heard of before?Publish and Perish was a good book. Ms. Wright introduced us to a character that we could like and investigate the clues with and we knew was going to be back to visit (hey, the author was the one who sub-titled the book Ben Reese Series - book 1).All in all, the plot was solid as was the writing and there were enough twists and turns to keep me intrigued. The only reason I gave it four stars was the ending - it did just that - end. It seemed as tho my book was missing a few pages because it seemed to end mid-sentence which was the only thing I found wrong with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short of story line","review":"The author seemed to have no idea where the story should go, so towards the end she thought up the solution"},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out for Sony Copy Protection - This DVD doesn't work on some systems.","review":"The DVD is no doubt excellent but Sony has a new copy protection system on it and despite trying two different sets neither one works with disc 1 (on 2 computer dvd drives and 1 independent DVD player connected to my monitor).It is obviously a copy protection scheme, good work Sony, I've stopped buying CD's and soon may stop on DVD's as well.

But, when I gave this book away to a neighbor with kids, I missed it so much I bought it again! It's a great book with not only illustrations of the caterpillar, but also the moth or butterfly it will become (something lacking in Wagner's book, because all moths are illustrated with their wings flat (and not necessarily how they land when you observe them)).

The excellent cast had some interesting stories and some good underlying tension, not only between the lead actors but also the suspense about the back story. Over the years, the tension has dissipated, the back story has been filled to overflowing, and what used to be fine, crisp acting has gotten a little less crisp and fine. The fine photography remains the same, but that's about it. If you're not familiar with this series, by all means take a look at some of their earlier work, but the more recent programs have left me disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still have not received... after several months!","review":"We ordered in September. . . still have not received the DVD.

In the past 5 seasons, there were a few nightclub dance scenes we mostly just listened to. This episode had two scenes that were basically unwatchable due to sexual content. In my opinion, it was way beyond TVPG. I saw two seconds and then only heard the rest of the one scene. That was yuck enough. Then they had to show yucky blackmail pictures in another scene. That was completely unnecessary. I am really hoping this downward trend does not continue, because it has been a fun series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub Par","review":"Something must have changed with the creative staff because this episode was really limping. The plot seemed cursory. The acting was rough as if each scene had fewer takes then normal. Accents were uneven. The climatic explosion was shoddy. Clearly some prop towers exploded revealing the larger building completely unscathed. The only thing it demolished was any tension or doubt about Sam's survival. Fiona's interrogation scenes were poorly executed as well. She's keeps her nice dress and jewelry, no jail jump suit for her. One wonders if she was even searched. All in all I hope this isn't indicative of the remainder of the season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"Burn Notice is my favorite show. Each episode is worth watching.

This book is just great! It has little development supporting exercises for baby and lots of different well illustrated poses for mom AND baby. As a new mom, it can be difficult to focus on your own yoga practise, and including baby is he perfect way to go.In the back of the book you can look up common postpartum conditions, like upper or lower back pain, shoulder pain etc with suggestions to poses to ease the problem!

All you have to do is sit back and it will entertain you. It has many humorous parts, but they're all realistic as well. Being a Deaf woman, I know. There are some cute sketches, but nothing really eye-catching in the way of illustrations. My only (and I DO mean ONLY) criticism is the price. It is a rather small book (a square with only about 100 pages) and much better suited in the used price range.If you're hearing and you want to learn abour the REAL Deaf world, pick this book up.

I knew it was in anecdotal form, but I thought the anecdotes would have a little more in the way of substance. Instead, I got a bunch of very light, largely uninformative and uninteresting anecdotes.

Only two things keep me from rating this a one and that's that Pinkwater is a good writer and the book is well written (i.e. gramatically correct, clearly worded, etc.) and that I've also read PINBALL by Jerzy Kosinski which is the worst book I ever read.So if you'd like to read something funny and thought provoking read something by Daniel Pinkwater other than THE AFTERLIFE DIET"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing a great song","review":"I haven't listened to the CD and only give it 1 star because....

I should add that I was fortunate to see this group perform several of these selections live in 1992 and was amazed - they sound just as good as the recording which is extreamly rare with acapella music.

As a fan of a cappella vocal music of all kinds, I have enjoyed several of Glad's previous outings. This one, however, was a huge disappointment! The song list leads you to believe you'll hear covers of traditional Christmas tunes, but they are in the minority -- there are ersatz melodies going on in most of them. And the arrangements are seriously lacking in imagination -- either too busy or too boring. Save your pennies and buy Manhattan Transfer, The Roches, or even Rockapella (which isn't fabulous all the way through but has some really great cuts)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless.","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the book. It was interesting, well-written, and true to life. It portrays the 1950s in a way that's often ignored - the darkside. Fascinating. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in a philosophical look at human beings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing with unlikeable characters","review":"Frank and April Wheeler seem to me self centered characters, so much so I don't have much sympathy for their problems. The book was plain disturbing and the ending horrible--supposedly there were psychological underlying causes stemming from the couple's childhoods (which were described) but no reason for April's desperate act at the end of the book. Also, the ending had the main character Frank disappear from the narrative and there is no knowing what becomes of him after what happens to April. I also think the two were very vapid and I didn't see anything sympathetic about either. The lack of morality or any humanity of the couple was just plain jarring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable Indignities","review":"These characters were so miserable, and so unlikeable, I found myself anticipating at each new scene set-up what uncomfortable indignity would play out this time.The biggest literary crime was not just each individuals' lack of range (nearly every one judgmental, dishonest and insipid), but the uniformity of these unpleasant characteristics between the characters. Each one (at least up to 1/2 way through) clustered in the same literary space. Without a few noble souls to throw the self-indulgence into relief, the book was stifling.A depressing painting in monochrome blues and grays, is one thing, but a book is a linear journey through time for the reader, so the pain lasts and lasts. Unless you put it down -- which I did half way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope, don't care","review":"I'm about halfway through Revolutionary Road and it's unlikely I'll be able to finish as I have no real desire to find out what happens to Frank and April. Will they find marital bliss? Will someone die?I don't really care.The story is told predominantly from Frank's POV, and he is a shallow, selfish, immature lout. This makes you want to root for April, but she's pretty shallow and immature herself. Two young suburbanites who are watching life pass them by and dreaming of something more. BO-ring.The author has a nice writing style - very prosey and old-fashioned. If you like that sort of thing, you'll probably enjoy this book. But if you're looking for a page-turner that will grip you and make you want to read all night long, this isn't the one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revolutionary Road","review":"I really can't add anymore on how bad this book is.

BORING","review":"Did the really make a movie out of THIS?I thought that we were going to see the life of the characters AFTER they moved to Paris.Can we really expect that someone would be silly enough to quit their jobs, sell all of their belongs and then take a whole family (including children) to someplace where they didn't speak the language or have any contacts to find a job? And that they would trade a well paying job that was certain for this uncertainty?Can we imagine that someone would commit suicide over not being able to carry out this daft plan?If Hollywood wants to make a film to try to demonize the 1950s (which seemed to be the latent point of this), then they could at least have tried to do it in such a way as to keep the viewers awake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully fleshed out characters","review":"A classic. Well written, hard to out down. Got to know all the main characters well, and found I could slip right into that era. Better than the film, just as a good book should be.

The story of a suburban post war couple living the illusion of the American dream. Fify years on Yates writing holds up as true then as today. And it stands as an excellent period peace that speaks to misplaced ideal of the good old days.In essence it is a novel about the banality of domesticated life. But throughout the novel I felt like I wanted it to go deeper. Perhaps if it were written in the first person...but the book is a solid piece of literature, but short of a five star review."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for me","review":"Melancholy people would enjoy this book.

I guess when I think of people in the 50s, I think of them being happy to have survived the war and happy to live in the suburbs. Well, this is not the way it is for Frank and April at all.

Blah, blah, blah. I read for entertainment, and this was NOT entertaining. You can see from my other reviews that I really enjoy the Janet Evanovich series, the Sookie series, and pretty much any entertaining new book that comes out. I got this book to read before I saw the movie. By page 150 I wanted to pull my eyelashes out one by one just to keep from falling asleep. This is the only book I can ever remember not finishing, and I've read some doozies. Save yourself the time and money and read ANYTHING else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to get through...","review":"Did not like this book at all. Both April and Frank weren't characters I felt like I could root for. I bought the book because the trailers for the movie looked good.

I read it back in the 70's when I was very much interested in having a different life than my parents(IBM!). And what is unforgettable is that this book, although highly recommended, was very boring and disappointing. At one point the characters are looking at their extensive book collection, remembering that it was supposed to have made all the difference, as though the books would jump off the shelf and live their lifes for them.

When I finally got the book, I started to read it right away. I was forcing myself to read it and when I read up to where they were talking about the rumors of Mrs. Givings' son in the loony bin, I couldn't read any further.I don't know why so many readers love this book so much. But for me, it's way boring and uninterested.

McInterney (sp?) \\"Brightness Falls\\". \\"Revolutionary Road\\", too, is culturally-centric, almost to the point that it satires neurotic behavior between young white couples in the 1950's from educated backgrounds.

Even so, I don't think I'll bother seeing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Character studies in surburbia","review":"Frank and April Wheeler on the outside are the \\"perfect couple\\" living in suburban Connecticut with their two children. Behind closed doors, though, April is a failed actress (that she is played in the film version by the terrific Kate Winslet is ironic) and Frank endures the drudgery of a 9-to-5 job. Planning to move to Paris and fulfill their expectations of greatness, Frank and April's shared life shatters with revelations of infidelity and broken promises. A lot of people pretend to be something they're not; this isn't new, but Richard Yates brings a fresh look to 1950s hopefulness and optimism in his dark look at marriage and coupledom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Picket Fences","review":"Yates does an excellent job of depicting the idyllic suburban couple: husband, wife, and two kids. Revolutionary Road masterfully captures the tensions of marriage, the disparities between wanting to say something and what is actually said, and the escalating hpes and dreams that seem perfectly tangible and then wither away. While some of the plot, particularly toward the end, seems slightly formulaic, the overall novel is nothing short of a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"A page-turner","review":"My wife's co-worker lent her the book and I ended up reading it through in a day. I found it to be stark and sad (in the portrayal of suffocated dreams and personal goals) but not to the point of hopeless despair.

The author's prose is beautiful and he goes deep inside each character. Eight people are vividly described using 50s language; but with much deeper perspective that most writers developed back then. Unfortunately, when we learn what's going on inside people, it's painful. Those last dreadful moments brought no tears because the outcome seemed so logical. I'm convinced that these people weren't at all like people I knew back then; but much more interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Suburbia!","review":"The story of Frank and April Wheeler, a couple not in love with either themselves or each other or the life they lead.Yates explores the great American theme of what lays under the thin veneer of the American dream-for all material intents,reached once you make suburbia.This theme has been followed from Peyton Place through to American Beauty and Yates adds the grinding boredom of the suburbian idyll into the bargain.At times this book is outrageously funny-the opening re the Laurel players amateur dramatic society's disasterous production of a pretentious play really made me laugh out loud.Real and very funny.RR just lacks that little something that made novels such as Gatsby or Augie March 5 star masterpieces, but it is still a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Big disappointment.

I don't think he can write a short story, essay or novel without bludgeoning his reader. Yet his characters, from both the female and male perspectives, are so real that you can stop on the subway and wonder about them like you would a neighbor or friend. There are few authors who hit marriage's daily life and all its isolation as convincingly as Yates in Revolutionary Road."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"So many good things have been said about this work. An author referenced this book in his own work and I thought I would read it. At first, it seemed as if this was a typical tale of suburban angst, but I quickly realized that there was something far more insidious here. The characters' neurosis begins to manifest itself and you realize what is truly at work in this ostensibly insipid setting. People have often compared this book to the Great Gatsby; I would have to say that this is a far better novel. Nothing is easy in this book, every character, setting, conversation etc...

Coleridge is an interesting poetic figure. An opium addict who imaged an imaginary country called 'Xanadu', based on an Asian legend about one of the descendants of Genghis Khan, Coleridge's visions are very scattered and lacking in unity. His poems, while some soar to great heights, are often confusing or pedestrian, and in this regard he is a lesser poet than Blake or Milton.Despite this and his constant dabblings in various religions and his unsystematic attempts to grasp a deep unity in the universe and in all knowledge in the realm of the spirit, along with some beautiful poems like the Ancient Mariner and some good essays and prose works (such as the Biographia) make Coleridge an essential part of any canon of English literature. He is a genius, even if not an outstanding one, and worth reading at least once.The Oxford Collections are generally of very high standard and worth purchasing for every canonical author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very impressed with Simply Accounting Basic","review":"I was hoping I'd like this more than the corporate bookkeeping system I currently use.

This third collection is aptly titled \\"Great Tenor Arias\\" for multiple reasons. Not only are there some of the tenor standards such as \\"La donna e mobile\\" (Rigoletto) and Eccomi finalmente ... Feste? Pompe? Omaggi? Onori?\\" (La Fi figlia del reggimento), but there are arias that are seldom recorded but which merit the exquisite handling of Sr. Florez. I would not have associated him with Gluck's \\"J'ai perdu mon Euridice (Orfeo et Euridice), for example, but his higher tenor is a perfect match for the role.Every aria is perfomed with full-throated perfection. He does not \\"slide\\" into the high notes but attacks them dead on every time. His mid range is perfectly controlled and the vibrato in his voice sends chills up my spine in a number of places.Sr, Florez continues to fulfill his promise of a long and brilliant career ahead.

There is a bit of surrealistic sequences (something absolutely necessary into a comedy) and the way he changes her initial election between the dean's daughter for his disinterested and new assistant Jane, seem to remark underlines that nobody is written or even predetermined by the destiny, we have the will and ways to make the destiny plays under our favour .A legendary cult comedy movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Houseduction!","review":"Plunging deep into the steamy side of house,this CD is a call to the bedroom dancefloor by an international cast of house hustlers.

Nevertheless, I recommend it because it feels authentic. The soldiers Irwin writes about feel real. You will learn details here about the Sherman tank that you won't find elsewhere. For instance, Irwin describes tank warfare against the German Tiger and explains how they beat that tank in combat. I had been under the impression that the Tiger was almost impossible to beat.In places, the book is humorous. I laughed where Irwin describes how he is temporarily captured before even entering combat.One time Irwin is reprimanded for killed a German squad that had just surrendered.

This may well be the safest and perhaps also the most comfortable approach to find the material for a book. And it could work for any subject, pianos in Berlin or cheese in Italy. Unfortunately what emerges is not a contemporary picture of the treatment of malaria or the history of malaria treatment but a rather skewed view on a historic niche.

I would recomend this book to anyone who has an Agent; is thinking of getting an Agent; wants to become an Agent; or is thinking of leaving her Agent.

To all but brandname actors the interior life of the creature called agent is a mystery. Ms. Rainford dismantles so many myths there's little choice but to draw clean slate on what you think you know about agents. Comparable to \\"The Art of War,\\" the hunter must understand the nature, habits, and motivations of game sought.

My husband and I are both actors, and we actually fought over who got to read it first (we alternated). I have already recommended this book to all of my friends who are actors. It is that valuable and should be required reading for every actor in Hollywood.The book is not just a primer on the Hollywood protocol and pecking order, but \\"How to Agent Your Agent\\" goes into such wonderful detail so as to demystify how an actor should handle his/her agent. So many actors are constantly in a quandry of how to handle a situation with their agents, or they are downright dissatisfied with their agents. This book helps an actor to define what you have control over and what you can change.

I think this has a lot to do with it being written mainly from an actor's agent perspective. And while the author throws in tidbits about how this is supposed to relate to the lit world, there just isn't enough depth. Nor does it seem is it written for someone at the beginning of their lit career where what you can expect from an agent is simply different (based on my experience and that of my friends in similar stages of their careers).

This book completely screwed with my head, along with the heads of my former classmates. Why in the would would you give a child who has experienced a loss a character to bond with only to have him die at the end too? It's cruel. Great for adults, sure, even possibly OK for adults to borrow verbiage from to discuss death with children. Completely inappropriate to give to children to explore on their own.I had nightmares for years, fixated on my ultimate demise rather than a healthy grieving process.Here's a thought-- talk to the children instead of passing them a book. Answer their questions, deal with being uncomfortable, know that it's OK to say \\"I don't know.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Book purchase","review":"I ordered the book, \\"The Fall of Freddie the Leaf\\".

Even though my son wasn't very upset by the death in the family he became afraid of death after reading this book. I regretted that I trusted the person who gave it and didn't read it first. Spoiler alert: Freddie is terrified of dying, eventually he is ripped from the tree by a bitter cold wind to the snowy ground, feels peaceful, and rots to eventually support the growth of the tree in spring.

Where do I begin? For young children who are very literal and concrete in their thinking, this story is terrible, hopeless and morose. As an adult, I can understand that the seasons reference the seasons in life. Most children will think you're talking about a year. Thank goodness my little girl didn't pay attention because I don't want to deal with her freaking out at the approach of winter, which is the conclusion of the book. Even with children who have a little more perspective in life, this book offers nothing. Maybe some people view death that way and that's fine but good luck using this book to explain that to a child. I think you'll have repercussions for a long time. The two reviews above me seem to support that thought. And for the love of all things good, please don't give this to a child or sibling of a child with a life threatening disease or condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"CAUTION: PLEASE READ THIS BOOK BEFORE READING TO A CHILD!","review":"Sadly I did not, having what turned out to be a misplaced confidence in the incredibly good ratings this book has.

My son asked who would be next to die? Grandma, me or even himself. This book was extremely helpful in explaining the cycle of life for all living things in a way he could understand. That was almost 30 yrs ago. Now I have a friend who's daughter is dying of cancer and she has 3 children under 8 yrs of age. I remembered this book given to our family years ago and knew it would be a big help for my friend and her family during this traumatic time in their lives. I highly recomend this book to anyone dealing with trauma, death, and grief."},{"rating":"2","title":"I read it to my children, the night my husband died.","review":"I read this book to my 6 year old daughter and 5 year old son the night their father died.

I installed the board no problem, but Win2K didn't recognize the card as a modem. I tried to update the driver with the software on the CD and with the latest driver downloaded from the web. Neither did the trick.So, time to call tech support. Well, they provide a number for tech support that costs $[money] per call. So I decided not to pay tech support for a product that didn't install. I exchanged it for a Creative ModemBlaster V.92 for $[money] more. Win2K installed the drivers automatically. I was up and running in less than 5 minutes. So I'd recommend the ModemBlaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks Academic Validity","review":"As a scholar of the beguines, I have become very familiar with the historiography on them.

Secondly the finish is so cakey and harsh...maybe if you pour gallons of it on your face with a paintbrush it will look natural. However that's the other problem, there's not enough, the bottle is way too small.Seriously, the biggest ripoff ever.

It's really well designed and the fascinating photographs are beautifully integrated with the text. First rate stuff all around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"This is a lovely book, with wonderful photography showing many aspects of international clothing in clear, bright, detail. (Like the title says!) It is well-written, as well, and although I would've liked pattern diagrams to have been provided, the line drawings go far toward helping understand the construction of the included articles of costume.The clarity of the photography makes it especially easy to see embellishment details such as embroidery, pleating, and fabrics, providing accurate information on various regional and historical items."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisite!","review":"Sumptuous full-color, full-page photos of historic clothing details, supplemented by intriguing line drawings of the entire garments and succinct commentary. This book can serve as a source of inspiration for anyone seeking elegance, beauty, vitality, and imagination in design. Interestingly organized into sections such as Necklines; Fastenings; Linings and Pockets, though regardless of the section, it is a feast for the eye."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful but did not meet my needs.","review":"I returned this book to Amazon because it did not meet my needs. Each garment portrayed in this book is portrayed in the same way. There are 2 graphics for each garment portrayed. One is a detailed drawing of each complete garment and the other is a detailed or close-up photograph of a small portion of the garment. My problem is that there were no complete photographs of any of the garments. I was surprised the authors chose not to photograph any of the garments portrayed in their entirety. Not one! A drawing doesn't come close to a photograph. And a close-up photograph of only a portion of the garment is not enough as well. You need a complete photograph of the entire garment in order for the reader to get the proper feel for a garment."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's Missing","review":"This is indeed a beautiful book, but it is also maddening! A full length color photo of each garment should have been included to demonstrate how the detail relates to the whole and the black and white line drawings don't do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"never receive the books","review":"It's been a long long time I still haven't got my books. sorry, but totally disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too skinny","review":"I ordered the 26\\" Trico 17-260 Teflon Blade Refill along with the 22\\" version for my 2008 Honda Odyssey. These were what was recommended by Amazon's auto parts look-up system. I have the OEM wiper blades. The length is correct but the width is not, so I sent them back. The Trico 17-260 and 17-220 are 1/4\\" wide (actually about 9/32\\") or 7 mm. What I need is 3/8\\" or 9mm. It's too bad Trico doesn't put the width of their wiper refills on the on-line info or on the package. It is also too bad that the auto-parts look-up doesn't distinguish between the skinny and wide differences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works, but makes squeaking noise","review":"My old wiper blades started to leave a smear of water on the windshield after three years of use, so I needed replacements. The Amazon site provides only a few choices when I type in Prius, and this one sounds good from its description, so I got it. The edge of this blade was rough and it did not wipe clean at first, but after a few hours of break-in, it was fine. Then very much to my disappointment, it started to make a squeaking noise after two months of use, and it did not rain that much. It still wipes clean, but the noise is so annoying that I have to avoid using the wiper. It is going to be dry season in California, so I will be fine for a while, and I hope it will cure itself after 6 months or so when it rains again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Compatible with 2006 Acura TSX","review":"When you search by vehicle, these refills come up. Please note that the 16\\" refill will fit perfectly on the OEM wiper, but the profile on this 26\\" refill is wrong.

They really do live up to their own hype."},{"rating":"2","title":"He shares his personal journey","review":"Billy Sprague's fiance's death devastated him. The songs on this CD take you through his journey from grief to healing. The notes on the insert give wonderful insights into his songs. Every song is wonderful--and it's rare that I like every song on a CD. This is one you'll want to listen to from start to finish many, many times and one you'll want to share with your friends. The style of the music is contemporary, a style I think everyone can appreciate since it's not distinctly rock, country, or other labelled style. I highly recommend this recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"ruined","review":"While this was a christmas gift for my father (as he and my entire family are huge fans of this album), I found myself extremely disappointed with the seller.

The characters are not as fleshed out as in his other novels and not one is really likeable.As always Greene is a great storyteller, or at least starts out here with a great tale but the plot simply ceased to interest me midway through the book.

Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too firm, your butt may go numb","review":"I bought this cushion to start practicing meditation once again. I remembered from many years back that I had used a round thick cushion that helped me avoid my legs from getting numb. So this cushion looked similar and the reviews suggested that people thought it was comfortable. Unfortunately, the cushion is too firm. It feels like sitting on the floor with no mat. My butt has gone numb every time I tried using it. After reading a review that said you could take out some of the buckwheat to make it more comfortable, I adjusted it twice but still got the same numbing result. I'm returning this cushion and will look for some softer, thick option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much new here.","review":"There is little that is new in this book; indeed, much of it is citation from Carpenter's biography and his edition of Tolkien's letters. The author seems focus a bit much on Tolkien's Catholicism; in fact, it becomes rather mind-numbing in the end, repeating the same thing in a different context. Mind you, I am not saying that Tolkien's religion did not influence his writings, but there were other things as well. I was looking forward to a new biography, but this was not the one I sought. The flaws in Carpenter's biography which Pearce and other reviewers on this page seem to dwell upon ought to be obvious to any of its serious readers anyway. I think one would be wiser to stick with Carpenter, the letters, and Tolkien's works. When it comes down to it, this biography relies too heavily upon block quotations from these, and, as a result, there was not enough new scholarship. The little that was present was a bit too narrow-minded for my taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much new here. . .","review":"I have been a devotee of Tolkien's works for nearly 20 years. As a theologian, I have long been interested in the philosophical/theological ramifications of the man and his work. I was hoping for much more than Mr. Pearce provided in this book. As I was reading it, I kept getting the feeling that I had read it before -- and much of it, I had, in Carpenter's biography and collection of letters. Frankly, in my opinion, far more material than was appropriate was culled from Carpenter for this to be considered a truly original work.Oh well! I guess if I want the definitive philosophical/theological work on Tolkien, I'll have to write it myself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"500 sheets of paper that fell out of the envelope","review":"I purchased the Mini Mini Set of 500 sheets of paper and planned on giving it to my daughter for Christmas. It arrived and as I opened the envelope, 500 sheets fell out. As a Christmas gift without the plastic wrap (which appears to have fallen off during shipping), it is completely useless.

I will try calling the company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working in 10 min or so...","review":"It's an awesome toy, but very poorly made. The forward and reverse motion stopped working as soon as the toy was taken out of the box. This is very strange, because the wheels kept turning while we were unscrewing the toy off the box holders (and would touch the buttons accidentally), but once the toy was put on the floor, it stopped moving after a few trial runs. The lights go on, the noise is deafening, the loader arm goes up and down, but the wheels are dead. New set of batteries failed to fix the problem. It appears that everyone has the same issue--very disappointing, because my child loves the toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible quality","review":"cool toy, kids love it, but it broke within a few days of playing with it.

Which explains why I sat through this creepy little B minus minus movie about legless, formaldehyde-swilling/flesh-eating mutants on a generic fishing island. (Supposed to be Maine, judging by the boat registrations, but apparently filmed in Canada- and God only knows what kind of accent those people were attempting. )Rutger, Rutger, Rutger. You are fast becoming Brandoesque in stature- and I don't refer to acting ability. You mumble and slur your words. You no longer get the girl.

I first saw him in a wonderful WWII movie called 'Soldier of Orange' then in 'Blade Runner', then he played a very convincing Albert Speer in 'Inside the Third Reich' and a convincingly creepy murderer in 'The Hitcher'...then his movie career just nose dived. One horrible...and I hesitate to call them...'B' movie after another he's made. What's up? What next? Rutger Hauer as Bozo the Clown?

Oh well, pass the popcorn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wierd...","review":"I originally bought because of Roy Dupuis. This is by far one of the oddest movies I've ever seen. I wish more time had been spent on John and 'Urs the Nurse' (an inside joke a friend and I came up with knowing that Kristen Lehman had previous been on 'Forever Knight' portraying Urs a vampire).This movie in fact inspired a group of Roy's fans to nickname him 'Vampire King' because this movie seems to be about an odd vampire-ish type of guy. Had the writer and director tried a more traditional vampire tale instead of focusing on the legless freak aspect, it may have been a better movie.However, as many have already mentioned, this is pure b-movie fodder.It's no 'Interview with the Vampire' or 'La Femme Nikita', but it you like Canadian productions and Roy Dupuis, it may be one to add to your shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"SORRY MOVIE FANS, THIS FILM SUCKS!!!","review":"Rutger Hauer is the only reason to see this movie if you do at all.

It was reviewed in Fangoria years ago under the title \\"Hemoglobin\\" and, of course, they showed all the best pictures from it. The effects are WONDERFUL!, as seen on the cover of the box. I'll bet just by looking at the nasty little things on the cover, that you would want to see this. Too bad you don't even get to see them until the very end, and they are such quickly shot, that you never get to see them as good as you do on the cover.

We couldn't agree on anything so we used the old randomly-grab-a-horror-movie move and well we grabbed this. Upon watching we started off hunched togeter with the lights off expecting a scare any moment. As soon as we saw the monsters we just busted out laughing! The monsters are so stupid and fake looking, and the plot is so not possible that it is hysterical! There is one scene with the monsters and a paranoid old lady in a whelechair that is a classic! If your looking for some great laughs get this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kristine Lehman is the only highlight.","review":"Very poor horror/thriller featuring Roy Dupuis and Kristine Lehman as a husband and wife arriving at an island to discover the man's past. The answer is a very sordid history involving incest. The silly script, poor acting, and bad creature effects eventually sink this movie into the level of preposterousness. Kristine Lehman's topless scene is the only highlight (10 seconds out of a 90-minute film)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Game","review":"Awesome game, love that I don't have to be online to play.

Beautiful photography, really great music, even hip hop and rap music that the younger people would love. To sum up in one word what this movie does is this movie SHINES. Gleaming Chrome, polished cars, sparkling cars in the sun, colorful people, friendly people, and a wonderful country that still has so much potential if only the embargo hadn't been imposed. There is such a rich culture and people do the best they can in very hard, poor circumstances while living in the past. This is a great movie and goes along well with the movie Buena Vista Social Club."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst keyboard I have ever purchased","review":"I rarely take the time to put comments on product I buy, but I felt compelled to put something up that might save someone a buck.About 20 minutes after I plugged in this keyboard, I realize both the backspace and the enter keys hardly work.

I contacted jet for replacement parts, which they do not offer. So it went in the trash as a waste of money.

The two meditation sessions--one led by a woman, the other by a man--gently encourage me to \\"give it up\\" and rest in the experiencing of the breath. Of course my mind wanders, and I'm ready to blame myself for that, too, but they tell me, so kindly, \\"not to give [myself] a hard time.\\" The result is that I move from the suffocating focus on my aching joints into an awareness of the broad and varied landscape of my breath, my entire body. The pain becomes only a small part of the rich life that breathes through me. It is the most honest and dependable relief I've found."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miracles abound!","review":"Reading this book inspired me to leave India and make a bee-line for Mother Meera's darshan.

As for Meera, five years on and I'm still glad I made the trip; my life is definitely better for her presence in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spiritual psychopathology or genuine enlightenment?","review":"I had never heard of either Mother Meera or Andrew Harvey until I picked up this book. I found the author's overwrought, hysterical experiences and conclusion that Mother Meera is the avatar of the Divine Mother to be interesting, but unconvincing.A search on the Web reveals some interesting material. The author, Andrew Harvey, has subsequently bitterly denounced Mother Meera for her failure to bless Harvey's homosexual relationship and for the horrible, horrible crime of \\"homophobia\\".Interestingly, the other books written about Mother Meera have also been penned by homosexuals. An odd \\"coincidence\\".If your spiritual inclination is to dissolve your ego/self in the all consuming embrace of the \\"Divine Mother\\", I suppose that a trip to Mother Meera's HQ in Germany may be in order. I'll pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"No. Dear god, just look at the title!","review":"Yes, it starts off as a reasonably coherent book about a mentally troubled intellectual. Right when he begins to get 'spiritual', the book takes a nose dive into incoherent new age dribble that is sloppily put together. An example would be like this: \\"Oh wow, I just had a spiritual awakening. A couple days later, another one. Wow.\\" Only it is less like a spiritual awakening and more like a psychological revelation about dealing with his wounded eros. This would be fine if it was presented in an exciting, sensible way, yet instead he chooses to drag the reader along on a tiresome journey into his own unconscious that yields less than a paragraph of Jung would in terms of profundity. What's more, he manages to make even less sense without any of Jung's complexity. It reminds me of so many movies put together in current times in which the plot is dull, full of holes and one is just relieved that it is over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Book","review":"This is Larry's second senior photography book and another great guide.

I even took the risk and dropped it 6 inches onto the wooden table. No thud or crack at all. An unprotected camera has a chance of breaking even at that short height. I feel confident my camera will survive my adventures, as I like to take a lot of pictures outdoors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-functional","review":"Luckily, this case came with my camera, because I never would have purchased it on my own. It is EXTREMLY difficult to actually get the camera out of the case; anyone who says differently either has no experience with other camera cases, or is simply trying to justify a frustrating purchase. No provisions for extra batteries, lens filters, or anything but the camera itself, and then when you'd like to actually use the camera, you have to find a place to put the case, as it has no strap itself, and you must completely remove the camera from the case to use it. That being said, it is at least construction wise very sound, and seems to protect the camera well. I recommend the other Sony case that is for both the 828 and 717, it does have provisions for other camera tools (chamois, filters, batteries, memory sticks, you get the idea), its own dedicated strap, and the camera is very easy to pull out in a quick moment. Don't buy this case, end of story."},{"rating":"1","title":"No answer key","review":"This book does not have any instructional information on how to do the exercises, it's for students that have already studied these types of problems and know what to do and it does not include an answer key, which is a disapointment!

I remember dancing with my (then) small children to this song fifteen years ago. There's not a bad song on the album and Glad's lyrics are always scriptural rather than abstract truths which may be twisted or misinterpreted. A perfect example is the aforementioned song which is straight out of Romans 1:16. Glad is assuredly not ashamed to declare the gospel of Jesus Christ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for a heavy user","review":"I'm a touch typist, typing at 60+ wpm and found this keyboard very frustrating. It seemed to miss letters. If I try to enter multiple ctrl key sequences, it wouldn't take them, recognizing the first ctrl key, but not the subsequent one. I'd have to release the ctrl key after the first selection and re-press it for the second one to register.I also had trouble with multiple selections using ctrl-click to select them. I'd start selecting a few items and then all of a sudden, I'd see only one item selected.I'm running flat panel monitors. If I put the receiver on the desk, but behind the flat panels, the keyboard would not work (total distance from receiver was about 12 inches).

I telecommute from home everyday so it gets a ton of use. I rarely have connectivity issues with the mouse as I've heard others describe. I love the features on the keyboard and I'm a huge hot key user so this has been great for me. I also love the design of the keys. As someone who has really tiny hands/fingers it has saved me from a lot of wrist and finger pain that I can get with regular keyboards. One thing to be aware of however, is if you are trying to network computers together at home, only very specific switches will work if you want to share this keyboard & mouse between computers (or any wireless combo for that matter).

It works like a charm."},{"rating":"2","title":"There will be a Light","review":"Once in a while there comes along an artist that just doesn't disappoint. Ben Harper is that type of artist. You can tell that by this project with the Blind Boys of Alabama. If you love LIVE gospel music you should definitely check out this DVD. The set is basic and the performances raw and unabashed. The concert alone is worth the price of this disc but to see the behind the scenes footage is priceless. I think the biggest compliment I can pay to this DVD is I play it on Sundays around the house to feel close to the Lord who is truly the light. Hopefully you will discover it and feel the same way too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning Blues DVD","review":"This DVD is so amazing, I have never seen anything like it!!

As a long time lover of black gospel music I'm very familiar with their work. Unfortunately, I couldn't say the same about Ben Harper. I'd never heard of him, but I figured the Blind Boys at the Apollo Theatre were a sure bet. Wrong! In my opinion Ben Harper sings his message songs with way too much intellect and very little soul. He's just plain boring. The Blind Boys, used as back up to his vanilla music, never catch fire. They are there for the job and their talent is completely wasted. Sorry Ben Harper fans, it's just my opinion. I'm sure his heart is in the right place, too bad his music is weak.

Having visited Lucca myself, I was somewhat disppointed to find that relatively little of the flavor of the place came through in the book. Worse, the characters are shallow and stereotyped. The detective intuits his way through virtually every difficulty, using his mind reading powers to solve each problem. While a psychic detective may appeal to some, I find the concept not at all believable. The rest of the characters are poorly developed, shallow stereotypes and the dialogue is childish. The story had potential, but in the end, I would classify this book as \\"fluff\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly written by a weak author with an oversized thesaurus.","review":"This is a very badly written mystery. The language is tortured, the plot is weak, the characters have no depth. Want some examples- try using the word \\"effulgent\\" in a love poem. The main detective intuits the next step (the same way the Profiler does on TV) and goes to the scene of the crime long after ward only to discover the main clue that all of the local police missed. Lastly, a mystery set in Lucca should be filled with details about the beautiful walled Italian city- you better know those details from another source, you won't find them in any depth here."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Italian Mystery","review":"This is a great old fashioned mystery in the Agatha Christie mold. There is an interesting, cultivated detective, a pleasant dalliance, and plenty of loopy characters.

The characters are all super achievers who suffer silently. They are not common people and are somewhat unbelieveable. The first half of the book moves too slowly. The number of characters just keeps growing. Instead of developing any of the characters properly, new characters are introduced.

His sense of security is threatened when his older brother defies their parents to take up with a local beauty and become a cowboy instead of going to college. Jick is challenged by unexpected changes in new grown-up ways and as he meets those challenges he sees himself and his world through a dying innocence.To say Doig's prose is rich and powerful is like describing a tornado as breezy. A master of the English language, story-teller par excellence and character builder supreme, funny, intelligent, witty, sad is to understate. Superlatives fall short of accuracy.

They aren't actually stuck down, but they often 'act' as if they're stuck.

Otherwise, you be spending more money constantly replacing these things. This thing doesn't type certain keys after being used for thirty minutes or more. Eventually it won't type any key(like a while ago when I had to reboot) It is only three months old and is already old and warn out. I'm going to spend a little more and get something that lasts, like a Logitec keyboard.P. S. if anyone knows what the 'Fn' key is, mention it in your review. Just curious, thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great value","review":"If you're looking for a keyboard that is not one of the ergonomic or natural types, this one is perfect. The most important feature in any keyboard to me is the tactile response. They keyboard I replaced with this one was very \\"crunchy,\\" meaning you had to press the keys too hard and it made a loud click with every keypress. This one has a light and springy feel which is just right.It has all the extra windows keys if you happen to use them, and is dirt cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"It broke after three weeks!","review":"I bought this keyboard as a replacement for a keyboard that had served me well for more than a year, but had started malfunctioning after I spilled some water on it. After three weeks, I am once again looking for a new keyboard. This keyboard would intermittently stop responding on a regular basis, and it looked like the plug was coming loose. It took considerable luck and a little re-jiggering for the keyboard to start functioning again after these incidents. Then, I pulled the plug out of the computer one day, and it separated entirely. This keyboard will work as a replacement -- but only for a little while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible keyboard feel, Keys jam.","review":"This has to be one of the worst keyboards I've ever tried to use. Some of the keys won't press down unless you hit them dead center and press straight down -- the other option is to press very hard, which is the only option if you're trying to type with any real speed. After only a couple days, my wrists ache. The keys that do work consistently have an awful, mushy feel, and they require too much pressure.This keyboard an ergonomics nightmare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I recently bought this keyboard locally because my computer's original keyboard went south. This was the only keyboard available at this store and it was cheap, so I bought it. 5 minutes and I knew it was junk. The right cursor key moves the cursor right one letter and then down one line, the spacebar adds a 0 every time you press it, then power keys are in the way, and the Shift keys have no feel. if you do a lot of work in word processors, or design web sites, like I do, this isn't a good thing. I have XP Pro installed, which may contribute to the problems, since the box doesn't state that it supports XP, but I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fairly good keyboard","review":"The Micro Innovations KB400i Windows '98 104key keyboard is a very useful keyboard. The feature that I like the best is that it is spill-resistant and it saves space due to its unique design.One thing I don't really like about this keyboard is that it is a white or cream color. I think that those colors are o.k. but for some peoples office supplies(desk chair etc.) they might require a black keyboard.Due to those few lines this is a very good product and it has many advantages"},{"rating":"2","title":"Color Purple CD","review":"I love my CD, I brought 2, went to see the play and had to have the CD, the music is right on cue, my friend I brought one for loves her's too, received in a timely manner.. been enjoying ever since, if fact returning to see the play again.

By the time this show was done I knew that this show was far better than I had expected and the critics were way off base. The best thing about this show was the music which had much variety, much feeling and did what the music in a show should do - it advanced the plot. Having just listened to the CD the whole musical was relived in my head, and I liked it even more this time!! If you liked the show, I can think of no better souvenir. If you are on the line about seeing it, let this CD do the convincing for you (and buy tickets!!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Truly Good Show","review":"During a week trip to New York, we got to see Tarzan, Drowsy Chaperone & Color Purple.

As a line splitter it's fine, splits a line as well as any other line splitter out there. I thought the funky universal socket was a pretty cool feature, and maybe it is: although the splitter only has a regular NEMA 5-15P (US) plug on the end, its socket will accept lots of different international plug shapes.Only I guess the international plug standards don't all put hot on the same side, and this splitter is actually wired so if you're using a standard US plug (yes, right, the kind that matches the one on the end of the splitter), you'll get your hot and neutral reversed!I wish I could have been in the room when the design team figured that out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cruel Joke","review":"This map is a cruel $9 joke by Lonely Planet: central area only, major streets only, selected hotels only.

The character development from start to finish was heartwarming and intriguing. What an original idea too! I mean, a Golden Bear! This movie would have to be ranked up there with Casablanca, Citizen Kane and Shawshank Redemption. Please people, honestly, this film is a cinematic suppository and you actually run a risk of decreased intellect by watching it. BEWARE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"As a sequel to a great miniseries this is a disaster. As a previous reviewer notes: How can this be a sequel if Shaka dies at the end of the original series. And while the series takes its liberties with history, this sequel is a travesty that borders on the bizarre. Shaka's capture by slavers was just one of a series of non-sensical historical b.s. This DVD is practically unwatchable....we finally had to turn it off. I could go on but life is too short. The only saving grace is that Henry Cele is one magnetic actor."},{"rating":"1","title":"1/6 of the miniseries on this worthless DVD","review":"Shaka Zulu was a 5 part miniseries (each episode was 2 hours less commercials or about 8 and 1/2 hours long). A well done abridged version was out in video at about 5 and 1/2 hours many years ago.This new version is 94 minutes. Don't buy it. Urge stores to throw it out, since it does not advertise the fact that it has cut 5/6 of the series, which was excellently acted and was about the most grand tv production ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled - this is NOT the terrific mini-series","review":"It's hard to believe that grown-up people did this.Complete drivel from beginning to end. Avoid this dreadful mishmash. It's not even a good \\"bad\\" movie.It does no service to history. It's pleasure to see such fine actors at work esp. Henry Cele. They deserve a much better vehicle for their talents."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is an insult","review":"This movie is horrible. Don't buy it. I am lucky to have looked at a friend's copy. It insults the memory of the great Shaka Zulu. It must have been painful for Celes to act in this silly moviewhich makes no historical sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"It might have been good before Hollywood got a hold of it.","review":"It must have been completly exhausting for Henry Cele to carry this movie for an hour and a half. You rarely see such true stage presence. It's too bad it was wasted in this movie. It gave a few shining monments of social criticism on the English colonial system and slave trade, but spent the rest of the time mooning over the weak romantic subplot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch at your own risk","review":"I had to do some research for a summer class on a battle/war/leader via film and the Zulu nation has always intrigued me. The only film I could find in my area was this one, unfortunately. Good thing I was able to find several good books because this movie - cut and pasted from a recent series - did not do Shaka, or the Zulu nation justice. More or less it was a movie about David Hasselhoff and a romantic interest. Their portrayal of Shaka was incorrect and the story was really \\"Hollywood.\\" Several of the books I checked out matched up - this movie did not. If you want to watch a fantasy story about Shaka, look no further. I'm off to find something more factual. If your interested in this topic and want to read about it - look up The Washing of the Spears by Donald Morris, or The Rise and Fall of the Zulu Nation by John Laband."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money","review":"The movie is horrible. The history is incorrect. I was expecting more action scenes with historical relevance; I was greatly disappointed. What scares me is that some history teacher is showing this movie during black history month and students are believing that the story is true. I'm glad I rented it and didn't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak movie with a few bright spots","review":"I have never seen the mini-series, so I am reviewing this DVD as a stand alone film. Although I didn't think it was as terrible as some of the other reviews state, it was pretty bad overall. The story has a lot of holes and nonsensical moments. The overall character development is weak. I never felt as though I really knew a single character in the film. There was no major villian, although there were certainly some bad guys (slave traders). I'm really not sure what the point of the film was.The best part of the film took place on the slave ship. That one part of this film really drew me in and made me shudder. Those scenes helped remind me of how horrible a crime slavery actually was, and how we how lucky we are today. Then, those scenes ended with an unintentionally laughable escape sequence.I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, but the slave ship scenes were enough for me to give it 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"how can this be a sequel?","review":"I'm confused...

First of all Shaka was not captured by slavers. I don't know why this film depicts that. Is it because he was a majestic and dignified king and since the 1986 version showed that they had to put some stereo-typical depiction of Shaka being captured and defeated by the whites slavers? This sounds like a bunch of b.s. and I'm upset that they are showing this crap to students in high school. That is not what happened. If they want to show something for black history why don't they show the original 1986 version of the film. Even that had some false depictions in it too, but at least they had Henry Cele act like a king. It was his performance that made the movie believable and it brought backbone to the story line. Why he would reprise his role like this I don't know. But get the 1986 one please. It is way better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shaka Zulu","review":"This movie was terrible.

Who ever thought of this mega-idiotic waste of money? The Shaka Zulu mini-series was the best ever on the life of Shaka. This is complete tripe with no basis in reality or in good taste. Imagine David Hasselhoff as a major actor in this movie (I love him in Knight Rider!). Why didn't they hire Leslie Nielsen for goodness sakes just for good measure and good natured fun. Oh and Grace Jones?! RIP Henry Cele!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Means well but ends horribly","review":"This movie is pretty hard to watch for anyone who likes a good drama or historical movies. Every scene was over the top and tried its best to make you care. Miss Farewell and Cpt. Prentice falling in love is nausiating. Yet, this tacky scene is trumped by the pitiful image of Grace Jones dead, sitting up with eyes open!!!!, because her man, Shaka Zulu, was away too long! The only highlights of the movie are the scenes where Shaka kicks butt and saves the day. The downside to that is the action scenes are so off the wall there's no point in saying it is based on a true story. Ex1-Shaka runs across Africa, on foot!, to kill a rivile king. Ex2-Shaka breaks the slave shackels from his wrists and takes over a slave ship single handed!It's one of those you have to see once to tell people it's nothing like the real miniseries movies.For the record, one of the worst sequels ever made. Should not be allowed to have the name \\"Shaka Zulu\\" on the cover!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I had low expectations, but it was even worse that that.
