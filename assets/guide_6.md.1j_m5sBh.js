Instead of going over the plot, which is done excellently in the spotlight reviews above, I will just state that I found this book thoroughly engrossing. The idea of people living with their souls as tangible beings is a compelling one, and the way Pullman uses that premise to join together ideas as diverse as armored bears and string theory is nothing short of fascinating.

I was sucked into this familiar yet utterly unfamiliar world that Philip Pullman, \\"the most dangerous author in Great Britain\\" (according to the Catholic church), has created. Great Britain, the Church, and the Aurora Borealis are all known to me, but daemons (physical manifestations of the soul every person possesses), Dust and gyptians are unique to this book.

Also, definitely NOT for kids.

Harry Potter is much better. If you want GOOD fantasy, try LotR or Harry Potter. But don't waste your time, life, or money, on this horrible, useless excuse for a novel. (Wait, did I say useless? It's a good prop for the uneven leg on your table. Or if you need something to feed your fire at Christmas. Or, you can also use it if you can't go to sleep at night.

It starts to get more and more interesting as you go on, but so do the jabs at Christianity. By the end of the book, Pullman outright changes and distorts the the book of Genisis and includes his new version. He makes abominable interpretations of verses, such as Genisis 3:19, his character says \\"it really means that God's admitting his own nature to be partly sinful\\"(Pullman, 373). How could someone accuse, even through fictional writing, that God is partly sinful? This is NOT a book for children, nor those who do not have a firm grasp of their Christianity. To suggest such things to children is beyond appaling. The characters of the story are rich, dynamic and fun to follow, but the underlying message of Christianity-bashing ruins this book. I am ashamed to own this book. I will give one star because the book does draw you in."},{"rating":"1","title":"It SUCKS !","review":"I have read this book - I have read books way better than thisWhat is it with all the confusion and crazy psycho violence Phillip introduces to children who have to read this book!

However after seeing the trumpeting cliches, vapid analogies, didactic moralizing and insipid political interpretations from every reprehensible source on earth from the Parents Choice to the NYT and Newsweek's invoking the loathsome Harry Potter I decided to skip it. Any book so systematically placating to such \\"moral\\" trend setters lacks subtlety and is worthless. There can be NO possible resemblance to Lindsay, Tolkien, or Lewis. The NYT reviewer is as obvious and crass as a barfly tapping green beer from NY's louder distilleries on St. Patties day. The visions imparted here are probably no less artificial. Also it's continuous feminist jabbing in the ribs is irritating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feminist Pederasty","review":"Pullman's books parallel the murky culturally drained environment of contemporary England whose assorted committees of public decency expurgate classic books because of \\"insensitivity\\".

Pullman fails on that count -- he is a derivative bludgeon rather than a knife. As one small example, the Texan balloon pilot who plays a minor role is in one scene nothing more than a copy of Han Solo in Star Wars. I approached The Golden Compass ready to be plunged into an epic adventure; I finished it uninterested in what happens to any of the characters. And as for ever thinking about going on to the rest of the trilogy, forget it.I realize this is both harsh and a very minority view, but wanted to warn prospective readers/buyers who may be on the fence about The Dark Materials, having heard the decade-long buzz, that sometimes, for some people buzz is simply wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing and Brilliant","review":"I thought that this book was increadable.

I just hope it's as spectacular as the other ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a note of warning -- but an important one.","review":"Ok, with 500+ reviews for this books the odds are against anyone reading this one, and I know Amazon likes to put the most glowing ones on top; still, this is important. I am 19. I read this book an enjoyed it. It's brilliantly written. However, The Golden Compass is marketed as a children's book, and THIS IS A MISTAKE. Sure, a kid could read this, I'm not questioning that. But if you buy this for your 10 year old, they will want to read the two sequels, and they get progressively darker and less appropriate for children. Watch out! Children should be challenged, sure, but this isn't a question of being too _hard_. This series is dark, and there are very scary ideas in it. It disturbed me, and it disturbed my 29 year old sister, and we are not known to be wimps. So, like I said -- just be warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Before Harry Potter there was Lyra!!!!!","review":"Pullman has created a wholly developed universe in which humans are paired with animal \\"daemons\\" (maybe that is where J.

Definately a book for kids over the age of 8.We loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...","review":"Yet another linear, mediocre fantasy book. Add it to the others of its kind from David Eddings and the like. Definitely not in the same league as Tolkien, C.S.Lewis or a few others. The plot is like a Sydney Sheldon novel for \\"kids\\". The Church is the evil empire (!) in a paralell universe, and also, as we find out in later books, in our world. The plot moves only in one direction, and you can identify each of the author's afterthoughts as he tries to make it coherent. Is he really trying to sell us his subversive view of christianity as the equivalent of evil and ignorance ? If so, he fails miserably in my view. The characters are blatantly one-dimensional, you close the book and forget their names, and will not feel endeared to any of them. They are not lovable, they are just there, like the zombies and specters in his books, devoid of any life of their own. My strong recommendation: rather than reading this stuff pick your old copy of The Lord of the Rings and read it again..."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't believe how much I enjoyed this book","review":"I can't believe how much I enjoyed this book, even though it's supposed to be part of a children's series.The story moves at a fast pace and there are quite a few darker element to this story, so I would probably recommend it for grades 6 and up.

Can't wait to see how they capture it on screen.The story revolves around Lyra Belacqua who ends up on a dark adventure trying to find her friend Roger who was kidnapped by The Gobblers. She meets many interesting people on her journey, including witches and armoured bears.

I'm not sure if this was Pullman's writing style (lots of dialogue, not many descriptions) or my fragmented reading style - but I just couldn't get into the story.I wasn't a huge fan of the characters.

The whole idea of daemons was quite interesting, since we still don't know exactly what they are. I am inclined to think that they are a part of a person's soul. In summary, this was one of those books that you remember for a long time after you have finished reading it, and can come back to again, each time finding something new to think about, rather like the Narnia Chronicles, and George MacDonald's, Ursula LeGuin's and Madeleine L'Engle's fiction.

She finds her self on a long journey in which she is not only searching for her past but her future and the future of the whole entire universe. She meets some great characters along the way, which you can't help but love. The way the book is written, it keeps you dying to find out what will happen next. Adventure, intrigue and betrayalline every page, as well as love, loyalty and friendship. It is absolutly impossible to get started and not finish. There aren't enough stars to give this book!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"way better than Harry Potter, but more scary too","review":"This book is much too frightening for anyone before their middle teens, so don't go giving it to the Harry Potter crowd. It's a great read, though. I am not into science fiction fantasy or Tolkein, but I couldn't put it down and read into the wee hours (a mistake -- I got scared witless in the dark house!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite books!!","review":"I love this series! Do NOT let the name (His Dark Materials) fool you! This book is for anyone who loves adventure. I don't recommend this book to anyone under ten, and only if you read a lot at ten. I have read many, many books. These books and the Harry Potter books are my favorites. This book, however, DOES have a little bit more violence then some other series. That's OK, because Lyra Belaqua (a.k.a Lyra Silvertounge) makes that up. This book shows you the wonders of a similair world to ours, gyptians, armored bears, the North, and makes you really, really, REALLY want a daemon. There is one bad thing about this book. Finishing it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelente!","review":"I did the all time no-no of book reading: judging the book by it's cover. I was short on time at the library and the book I wanted wasn't in, so I grabbed a book with an interesting cover and proceeded to read. And it was awesome! The book was better than the cover! The reader can really relate to Lyra and her pain and struggles. You cry, laugh, and plot along with her. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZINGLY WELL WRITTEN!!","review":"This is by far the best series of books that I have ever read. I am a really big Harry Potter fan, and I personally believe these books are better. (sorry J.K. Rowling) When I started reading them, I couldn't put them down! My family owns the books on tapes too and they're great, the acting voices are really amazing, it's like watching a play or movie.Philip Pullman is an amazing author, and I have recently recieved a book from the library, (not written by him). The book is all about the science behind his writing (it's all true). He really did his research, and this is a great book to read, I first read it when I was 10, and it was great. The books on tape are nice to have because many of the words and names are very hard to pronounce. I highly reccommend these books!Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book!","review":"I really liked the book! It left my dying to know what was going to happen next. And I still haven't read the sequel to it. It's a magical book and also a mystery. I recommend it to around 11 and up because I read it when I was 11 and I still thought it was good. If you are thinking about buying this book, let me tell you this: It is really good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I really loved the book, but he forgot the ending","review":"I absolutely adored this book but you have to take it in little gulps(becuase its so dark and heretical), and it has a hang off ending almost as if . DON'T WORRY I WON'T TELL YOU THE ENDING. Phillip Pullman seemed to reach the end and then think \\"Hey, this is getting pretty long. I could make this into a trilogy.\\" However I strongly recomend it except once you read this book you will have to read the Subtle Knife and the Amber Spy Glass(coming out next may). It is still a great book and I would recommend it but only if you can stand the heresy."},{"rating":"2","title":"MIND BLOWING FANTAST","review":"I read this series years ago and was blown away by the sheer scope of this fantasy written for \\"children.\\" I recently listened the Golden Compass on tape -- a fantastic production by a full cast -- and fell in love with the story all over again. I am not eloquent enough to give this book the praise it deserves. But I do feel compelled to cast 1 more positive review to the sea of 1,000+ positive reviews in the hopes of counteracting, in a small way, the smear campaign that the religious right has embarked on. Don't let the intolerant dissuade you from discovering a truly amazing and inspiring story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cant find a better triology","review":"In Lyra's world, it's all about having fun. At eleven years old Lyra lives in Oxford at Jordan College. There she is taught by Scholars, plays with servants, and is always looking for trouble. Her world changes though when she and her daemon Pan sneak into a secret meeting and overhear of children disappearing, and strange works in the north. After her friend Roger is kidnapped, she vows to find him and stop whatever it was that was kidnapping the children. From there things unfold when she is taken from Jordan to live with a woman who is not what she seems. Before leaving Lyra was given an object that looks like a compass, but is really an Alethiometer, an object few can use, and coveted by the Church. Lyra is smart, but she has many things to decide, and so much she has yet to learn."},{"rating":"2","title":"My review","review":"I read The Golden Compass. The author of this book is Philip Pullman. This book is a realistic fiction book.I kind of liked this book. It was interesting. It is about a girl who has t find this place using a compass. This book would be better for someone who is over 14 years of age.I did like this book. It had suprises when you least expected it. This book is better suited for someone who likes fantasy books that relate to the real world today. They also need to like adventure books that have interesting suprises."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"It was a little younger than I thought it would be but I enjoyed the fantasy! Very good read, I recommend it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic Beginning to a Fantasy Series","review":"Philip Pullman has crafted a fantasy world that is rich with detail. A broad cast of characters are brought to life as the reader follows Lyra, the main character of the story, as she travels north to rescue kidnapped children and find her father. I am 30 years old and I was told by a friend to read this. I was doubtful about reading Young Adult fantasy, but I was pleasantly surprised to find the material is suitable for an adult audience. The depictions of violence are definitely not for the younger crowd.I am currently starting the second book of this series which, so far, is proving to live up to the success of its predecessor.

I am a 37-yr old male who has been reading fantasy for most of my life, and folks, this ain't it. This is a long-winded morass of religion, attempted fantasy, and social commentary. The title should be \\"Lyra has a Tea Party with her Stuffed Animals, while Gyptians pull her Around in a Red Wagon.\\" Her supporting characters zip her from trouble to trouble, and just as deftly extract her from said trouble. The daemons are awkwardly explained, and I never ONCE thought Lyra was in any mortal peril, terror, or even emotional distress. ...."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good book for an adult...the trilogy becomes antireligious at the end","review":"I do not think this book should be given to young children who are looking for a good read. The themes in this book include a nun who breaks her vow of chastity and counsels the two main characters to have sex. Additionaly, God is pictured as an old man locked inside a box. The messages in the book are subtle and not apparent in the first book. I liked the trilogy but find it disturbing that it is given a good recommendation by librarians and booksellers without any thought as to the content or the appropriateness of the recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book i once read by me","review":"I found this book unbearably boring at first and I was almost tempted to put it down but luckily it was compulsory for us to read it and I continued.

I have now proceeded to read the next two books in the series....You must read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An exiting and suspense-filled read!","review":"This book is a complex and gripping epic that will undoubtedly become a classic! Its exicting and absolutely 'can't-put-down'As the book progresses you want to know more, and you become entranced by the plot and its mysteries. It has a slow start though, so dont be discouraged but keep it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Northern Lights","review":"This book started slowly. I found the start so boring that i nearly put it down, but luckily i kept going. Once the story really starts the exitement begins and you find yourself captured inside the secrets and terrors of Pullmans imagination. dont do what i nearly did and put the book down! you will regret it if you do. Not neccasarily a book for harry potter fans and lord of the rings fans. A fantasy that has many links to our world. The end is a bit rushed and dissapointing, maybe to make people read the second. it worked for me and now im reading the third. a great book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enthralling...Entrancing...","review":"This book, and the series of His Dark Materials written by Philip Pullman are extraordinary. They reach beyond reality and provide new possibilities tying in with the history of all human kind. This book deals with various spheres: religion, politics, social and personal. Read about whole new characters : the armored bears, the Gallivespians, the angels, the Church and Authority, etc. Follow Lyra's adventure in a quest to discover not only the truth about herself, but that of the fundamental existence of human beings as a whole. Discover new worlds providing an infinity of new possiblilites and ideas.

I took for granted since had won several awards it was ok - it's not."},{"rating":"2","title":"even as an avid reader & an adult, I loved this book","review":"Pullman here has written a trilogy very different than Harry Potter. Where as Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings might tell a great tale that will sweep a reader of any age into a fascinating world, Pullman has gone deeper and added a subversive element. What fascinates me about this trilogy is the manner in which Pullman takes on aspects of society such as the church and ferociously attacks it.Though the characters are not fleshed out to a great extent in comparison to fiction oriented more exclusively towards adults, the story will weave an engrossing web around the reader. Not only will you be swept along on a mystical ride through a surreal universe, but you will encounter problems faced by our present day world with a new perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended to anyone with an open mind","review":"I am a 13 year old girl, and many would think I could not understand the writing of a genius like Pullman. I understood it perfectly, and I loved it. This book is well-crafted and smart; the plot is complete, and makes you want more. I've read many of Pullman's books, including \\"Ruby in the Smoke\\", \\"Shadow in the North\\", \\"Tiger in the Well\\", \\"Spring-Heeled Jack\\", \\"Clockwork\\", \\"The Golden Compass\\", and \\"the Tin Princess\\". After reviewing Pullman's style, the reader can tell the depths of the ethics and morals of each story. I'd recommend this to anyone with an open mind- You'd need one to appreciate \\"The Golden Compass\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book in the world!!","review":"*****I give it 10 stars!I read this book once then fell in love with it!I am eagerly awaiting the 3rd book The Amber Spyglass."},{"rating":"2","title":"who said?","review":"Who said that Philip Pullmans book trilogy the first two bools are not the best?No one!

With twists, turns, and adventures here and there, this book is page after page, going on and on, on a long and suspending ride, and when it stops, you wish you could keep going. However, they do stretch some parts in the book and that makes me a little irritated. I find it would be vague for children under the age of 11. It would be a perfect for a young teen though."},{"rating":"2","title":"you think it's bad?","review":"if you think this book is bad think this book is bad you are carzy. i read it because the 7th graders at my school read it. i loved listining to the athor reading it and the other people did a great job."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm glad I read this one!","review":"The Golden Compass is the first of Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy. It is a story about a girl named Lyra who lives at Jordan College and has a best friend named Roger. Many children dissappear including her friend Roger, and she goes on an adventure to try and find out what happened to them. This book contains magic, adventure, witches, daemons, bears and all kinds of other interesting things. The end sets up for an exciting beginning in the second book. I cant wait to read it!

From the beginning, I was stuck on the book. The Golden Compass is such a good book, I take my time reading it, so I can read it longer! Some may get lost in all of the characters, but if you don't spend all your time trying to understand them, they're fine. I immediately started to like Lyra, the main character, because she's brave and not a priss, like some other male authors make females characters out to be. This is a book about adventure and it's the old-fashioned quest kind of story, but it's good and I would reccomend this book to any one who asks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Armored Bears, alethiometers, daemons...","review":"This series is my favorite out of all the other books that I have ever read, and they number quite a few. The world(s) that Pullman has created is amazing - daemons, panserbjorne, alethiometers, the Silver Guillotine, Specters. I can't believe that all of this came out of one brilliant mind, and I truly adore the novels. The characters - Lyra, Lord Asriel, Mrs. Coulter, and Pantalaimon for now, and Mary Malone, Will Pary, Serafina Pekkala, and Lee Scoresby a little later - stay with you after the end of the last book. I plan on getting the companion book on the 29th, and I hope that Pullman fans will also to support the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is great!!!","review":"This is an example of great young adult writing. It doesn't hide anything like some books try to do, assuming that the kid doesn't have a grip on reality. Instead Pullman assumes the reader has a pretty thorough reading history and isn't naive or squemish. A great heroic story that leaves you wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not kiddy stuff but really kicks","review":"read it read it read it i tell you now. this triology is one of the best i have ever read. i'm an 8th grader and even though this is a book for young adults, you have to be more on the adult side to be able to read it and like it. While this book may have many controversial issues in it according to your religion, it never affected what i believe in. pullman has woven a web of a story so unique, that no ever spider will ever come close to this story. what more can i say?"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's no Harry Potter","review":"I bought this based on some of the reviews I read which compared it to the Harry Potter series. That's pretty misleading as far as I'm concerned. The problem here is not really with this first book of the series. It's actually pretty enjoyable and well written. The real problems start to develope in book two and then become full blown in book three. If I were interested in blasting these from a religous standpoint, I'd say that portraying god as a senile, drooling idiot incapable of even walking on his own may be in poor taste for younger, impressionable readers. But I will leave that to others to debate. My complaint is that the first book draws you into what appears to be an interesting story and then steadly becomes increasingly boring, confusing, poorly written and just plain stupid through the next two books in the series. Unfortunately, you can't just read the first book on it's own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phillip Pullman is a freak of nature.","review":"I am a new member of EFAAAL, a group of reviewers which is growing quickly. Along with a lot of other people, I, Calandra Garton, believe this book does not deserve to be published. Sorry, but that's just my thought. And I also agree with the readers from San Jose and Mexico City. I support you two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply did not like","review":"This is a book that I read all the way through hoping that eventually it would get better. The writing is so poor that it was almost painful to read. Pullman, an adult male, has a very poor grasp on Lyra, his girl heroine. The Daemon concept is never fully articulated, and if I hadn't read the jacket I would have never understood it. In my mind, this is the quality of a first draft that needs a major overhaul. Great concept, dismal follow through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snoozer","review":"I'm a big fan of the fantasy/magic genre so I was excited about the positive reviews. But as I read this, I kept thinking \\"What's all the hype about?\\" I thought the plot was boring, the characters not well developed, and the writing was amateur. I had to force myself to finish the book, but I was determined to finish it to see what the big deal was.I understand that this book is marketed for young adults, but frankly, I think that most young adults - even those with not the best reading comprehension - would be more advanced than this. I couldn't believe that so many adults claimed they liked this book. I was yawning constantly at the dull and sometimes sophomoric writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I only rated it one star so you would look at this review...","review":"I thought that this was a wonderful wonderful book, defiantly the best I have read (next to the Sublte Knife, of course). ANyone who says that the charecters are \\"childlike\\" are right...they ARE children, which makes these books so interesting. And, this book is defiantly not satanic....and even if it is against G-d, its okay for Philip Pullman to express his views."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potential butchered","review":"The plot starts off really slow. It does eventually develop into a good and exciting book. In fact I was thinking I really liked the book despite the beginning, until I got to the end.

I'm returning the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this book","review":"Decent writing but the authors anti-Christian bias shows through too much.

The beginning was good, but after that, it went downhill. When i first read it in 5th grade, i had nightmares for weeks because of what they do to the children. Now that i have forced myself to reread it, i found this book disturbing in more ways than one. I realized that \\"Daemon\\" is actually an alternat spelling of demon. If that is satonic, i don't know what is. The characters were poorly drawn and not well developed. The story line had good potential, but it was ruined by Pulmans aufull writing style. The only part i liked was when Lyra used the Golden Compass. That is pretty pathetic."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Golden Compass","review":"Lyra has always been adventurous and it has led her into several awkward predicaments, but she is about to stumble into her greatest adventure yet.

When one of Lyra's friends is taken, she decides that she must go find him.Her quest takes her across the world from the city of Oxford to the swamps where the gyptians live and finally in to frozen north of Svalbard. Here she discovers the awful truth of what the Gobblers are really doing, and it's worse than anyone had imagined.Lyra's adventures are beyond belief and fantastic. While she can be quite an obnoxious brat at times, you can't help but fall in love with her and her friends. Her friends are varied but loyal. There's just something about the girl that they can't resist wanting to help.

The beginning will be a little confusing, of course but by the second/third chapter you will know *exactly* what's going on and will be able to go on the adventure with Lyra.

Still, I must admit that \\"The Golden Compass\\" is pretty bad. I am a more moderate member, so I gave this book a two-star rating. By doing this I'm being pretty generous.

Lyra's boldness and courage, and her bond with her daemon, give this story heart, the suspense builds to a fevered pitch, and Pullman's wonderfully layered world is fascinating. There's so much to love about this book, from the gyptian boating clans to the armored bears to a mercenary Texas balloonist... The Golden Compass numbers among a handful of classics in fantasy and I absolutely cannot wait to read the next two."},{"rating":"2","title":"late to the party","review":"I'm coming late to this popular fantasy trilogy, of which THE GOLDEN COMPASS is the first part. The setting is a world very much like but not entirely our own. Lyra, a young girl raised in the halls of an Oxford college, is hurled into a massive effort by the Church to reverse original sin (called \\"Dust\\"). The plans involve kidnapping children and separating them from their daemons, the animal projections of their soul.Both of Lyra's parents are involved in the effort to understand Dust, and indeed Lyra's father may have discovered a portal to another world. THE GOLDEN COMPASS is often marketed to young adults, but the concerns are really adult. At what moment do we \\"grow up\\", how do we change? What is it that separates adults from children? There's high adventure but also a philosophical journey, and I look forward to reading the second & third volumes. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspires awe in the writing and the magic","review":"The Golden Compass is stunning - it's full of unique ideas and an incredible landscape. It hardly feels like magic, and science of a sort underlays most of the ideas in the book. But it's thrilling and full of rich, deep, funny characters who continually step out of the page and into three dimensionality. It makes Harry Potter seem positively workaday, but, on more reflection, Potter and Lyra (the star of this book) are two sides of a coin. They're both headstrong, but Harry has to fight his battle against ultimate evil inside a framework. Lyra's world is falling apart and so rules have been broken already - she has to use all means at her quite extensive disposal."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Good Book","review":"I think this book was the best book I have ever read, I have also read book 2 and I can't wait until number 3 comes out!

I am 11 years old and I loved it! It has strong characters, good villians, and a suprise ending. It is not one of those prissy, oh-John-save-me books starring girls, because the villain is a girl, and Lyra is tough. This book is slightly cotrovercial, because there are scientific tests that some characters do on childeren which result in death. But I give this book 1000000000000000 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"my favorite book ever!","review":"I read this book first when i was ten and didn't quite understand. It is very complex and dark, but also has a wonderful story. I re-read it two years later and loved it! the whole series is fabolous! a must read for anyone between the ages of 11-111!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for fantasy lovers...","review":"I am more of a 'classic literature' lover, and when it comes to fantasy, I generally stick to the very classic classics, such as \\"The Last Unicorn\\" and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy, but I was completely drawn into and fascinated by this book. The story of Lyra Belacqua and her not-quite-like-our world where she is drawn into a fight for what she thinks is to save her friend, but we learn is much farther reaching. Although classified as a children's book, there is much more to keep an educated adult entertained. The concept is very complex, and, if you read it while thinking, can bring up issues about God, religion, science, human emotions such as loneliness and the will to be individual, and, of course, the ongoing battle between Good and Evil. This book also made me want a \\"daemon\\". Read the whole trilogy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVED this book it was a great read!","review":"This book opens your eyes to a whole world and explores the wonder of being a child, and the power of friendship please have the time of your life and read this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Think the book was probly the best I ever read.","review":"First of I liked the very realistic (or so he made it seem.) The characters I loved, the things the did really made you get into the book. One thing I disliked was the end; it was too abrubt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bored? DON'T BE!","review":"The Golden Compass, and its sequel, The Subtle Knife, are enough to keep you from being bored for a long time. Even if you read quickly, contemplating your daemon's form and the complexity of Lyra's world can and will tie you up for hours after putting the book down. Five stars. I have read many science fiction books, but this one is easily the best of them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but Not Great","review":"The main character Lyra is described well. She is likeable and her adventure is great. There is a great deal of magic and different creatures in this story. My favorite is the armored bears. When I was reading this, it never really kept me all that captivated, sometimes I found it boring, but overall it was quite well done and I will read the next two to finish the set. Don't get me wrong, there are some great parts, when Lyra learns her past and there is a good amount of mystery still to be unraveled as we see in the stunning ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tale For Everyone","review":"This book is captivating, to say the least. Within the first five chapters, the author Pullman has the reader seeing the world through the eyes of the young heroine, Lyra. Lyra is a former street urchin, who, now, through a strange turn of fate, is trekking through the far north with Gyptians(gypsies)and a giant talking polar bear with armor and opposable thumbs. She is given the gift of a small compass-like instrument called the alethiometer that tells her the truth. It doesn't predict the future or tell fortunes, it tells the truth. With this \\"golden compass\\", Lyra and her friends bravely forge forward to save the world from Dust, a mysterious substance. This book combines all sorts of adventures with comedy, tragedy, and romance. It is just the beginning of a fantastic trilogy. YOU HAVE TO READ THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Pullman creates a believable world in his first few chapters and I enjoyed reading that part of the book. I felt that he had a jumble of good ideas and tried to throw them all in at once. In the end I was confused and while I didn't want to give up in the central character and her bear I ended up finishing the book dissatisfied. Perhaps others will like it more; perhaps I read it too quick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It!","review":"I have read and reread The Golden Compass so many times over I can't count, and I still love it. If you like anything fantasy you will like this book alot. It deals with other worlds, and epic adventures in them. I felt like I knew the Lyra and Pantalaimon by the end of it (the two main characters). Also, right after you read this, you'll probably want to read The Subtle Knife, which follows it. I'm still waiting for the third one, and can't wait to read it! This is a definite buy, and you'll be hooked right away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Share this with your young teen","review":"I cannot wait for my daughter to read this book. We take turns reading and recommending books to each other. She loves books about strong young women, as do I! Make sure you also get the Subtle Knife. You'll want to pick it up immediately after you put this one down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Golden Compass","review":"Lyra is a girl at the Jordan College. She and her friends talk about monsters called Gobblers that eat children. Lyra's best friend, the kitchen boy, Roger is taken by the Gobblers. When Lyra meets her so called foster mother, Mrs.Coulter, Lyara is taken advantage of. Mrs.Coulter is the boss of the Gobblers, just she seperates the kids from their daemons. You should really read this book and The Subtle Knife, the sequal to The Golden Compass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prompt service, excellent book","review":"The book was delivered on or before the date promised, and it was in very good condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Read","review":"Os shares some awesome commentary on the state of relevence in the church. He also brings the plight of the ancient prophets into the modern world and compares them to the \\"untimely\\" people today.

The only down fall and the only reason I rated it a 4 and not a 5 is because it is not very easy to find a store that carries the paper/ink set for the printer. Other than that, if you are an instant gratification person this printer is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Canon Abandons Its Customers","review":"I bought the larger Canon CD-300 printer less than a year ago for $400. Now, Canon says they will not create an XP driver for it. That is an extremely poor customer server. Anyone making PC-compatible hardware has to be prepared to support it for a reasonable period after they stop selling it. Canon promotes their printers as Microsoft Windows compatible, but the CD-300 doesn't run on the only version of Windows that Microsoft is selling! That is deceptive. I own a Canon digital SLR and digital SureShot. Because of this clear example of how little they care about their customers, they are the last Canon products I will purchase. Today, instead of buying photo paper for my defunct Canon CD-300, I bought the Sony DPP-SV77. It's a great little printer with a pop-up display for much less than the Canon... and Sony has great customer service!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Take care which camera you have!!","review":"I bought this Photo Printer in order to print photos from my Canon digital camera PowerShot S20.

Do these people have jobs? I mean, seriously. What do they do all day? And when the girls escape, nobody notices. Which gives us the young, fit girls fleeing from zombie-like crazed killers. As the title says - meh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reissued version of The Good Food of Italy","review":"This edition is basically a reorganized version of the prior Knopf 1990 edition of \\"The Good Food of Italy, Region by Region\\" which was printed in paperback by Arrow as \\"The Food of Italy\\".The material, especially the recipes, is virtually the same.Some chapters have been reorganized as to where they are located in the book and the writing very slightly edited.For example,the sections such as Basics are now at the beginning of the book instead of the end.The other editions include photograph sections.Perhaps as another reader suggests this is a budget version.I like Roden's cookbooks so which ever version you buy will proove useful but don't get fooled into thinking this is a completely revised edition especially if you do enjoy photographs in your cookbooks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too little too late","review":"I was told this was the best baseball book of the year. I didn't get it until after the season started, and when I did, I got a juvenile treatise with about four bright spots, and a really bad case of envy for everyone else that does analysis. I would be embarrassed to be associated with this incarnation of a tantrum. My five year old can behave with a little decorum, which is more than I can say for whoever edited this. Only a couple of writers are worth even glancing at, Firtado and Walker, and they're clearly too smart to stick with this sinking ship for long. Their work gives this book a second star, but just barely.It's also hard to read, amateurishly put together, and basically a complete waste of money and time. There's no reason to buy this book. The childishness evidence in this book is so bad as to be disrespectful to the game. Don't these authors even LIKE baseball?Hideous."},{"rating":"1","title":"big and bad are correct","review":"As a baseball fan who reads any book of analysis I can find, I eagerly awaited this year's BBBA. I was extremely disappointed that the editors found it necessary to go into childish tirades against their competitionI usually don't wallow thru all the stats that the BBBA folks put out as I enjoy the commentary more. However, since the commentary was more in the line of sophmoric back slapping and finger pointing, I thought I'd study the stats more carefully.The BBBA folks will tell that they are right. I did find much of their analysis to countradict their competitors. While I don't know who is right or wrong, a least let me decide as to which information I find more useful, don't tell me.I especially found the attacks on Bill James to be curious. Bill James started the revolution on baseball anyalsis, in essence giving these insolent writers their start. If you don't agree with him, just write it, don't rip him.I won't spend another penny on the folks from BBBA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deja Vu Review","review":"I tried it again this year despite my better instincts. I won't again. These guys are oblivious to their readers, even ones who wish desperately to steer them to their strengths and away from their weaknesses.

I would recommend the book to undergradutes and anyone who is trying to understand how to use vector analysis without the proofs. There are plenty of worked examples to help you through the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Physics...","review":"This book would be much more perfect if it had more explanations concerning the physical meaning of the various formulas derived.It concentrates more in the mathematical aspect of a formula, and it does not give you a complete \\"mathematics - physics\\" relationship concerning this formula.

These arose as analogs for modelling the complex personal interactions in large cities. They are seen as a vital mutual aid structure that can prevent or reduce pathologies. Conversely, many people who end up on the streets lack or have foresworn these networks.These days, social networking is a very popular idea, driven by the Web successes of such sites like MySpace.

Mark even says that winning is just like a drug -- it's addictive.I'm quite proud of this book and I'm proud that Mark Martin and I share the same home town. Batesville, Arkansas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very private look into Mark's private and public life.","review":"I have to say that I was surprised that Mark showed as much of his childhood and personal life as he did. I found this book to be more of a diary then a publication. What a tribute this book is to Mark's dad. It was very informative as to his struggles and his trimphs. I now have a greater understanding of what these extrodanary athletes have to go through for their SPORT. I am a very dedicated MARK MARTIN fan and I guess that I am bias. I do recommend this book for ANY NASCAR fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great insight into a young man's dream of being a racer.","review":"This book was excellent. With my love of Nascar and of Mark Martin this book was an experience for me. I am a young person trying my best to get into Nascar and reading this book gave me ideas as well as a friend. It let me know that I was not the only one who is having to struggle to make it to the top. For it seems like other drivers get there very quickly. Mark Martin's book is wonderful and anyone interested in racing should read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good account of the hurdles to becoming a NASCAR driver","review":"I am a Mark Martin fan, and this book makes me even more proud of my choice of drivers to follow.

Includes interesting commentary on Kentucky politics, on tactics (some of the arguments in Nosworthy's recent analysis receive support here) and on Morgan's life and personality. Very good and detailed on Morgan and his men's imprisonment, and also discusses Morgan's death and the subsequent bare survival and dispersal of his forces. Occasionally personable, as when Duke is seasick on the way back from prison and expresses his hatred of boats; generally a detailed and valuable memoir account."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow reading","review":"I have a vested interest in Morgan's raiders since the Morgan in question is a long distant relative of mine. I have tried to find worthwhile reading material on him, but have not been able to do so. Basil Duke was Morgan's right hand man and wrote this detailed history.

There is a fair amount of compression and clipping and distortion. Which is totally unnecessary given the style of music. People who are going to buy this record aren't looking for in your face Metallica mastering, not by a long shot.But I guess it's typically of today's mastering guys that they don't want to be known as quiet engineers so even on releases like acoustic folk they will jam the levels up and distort the music.

The product works pretty well but they don't last. We had one stop working early on that was replaced. Since then we have been using four mole movers around our property which do seem to keep the moles/voles away. We remove them during the winter. I just put them back in the ground last week. All four started working then two of them quit. I've actually taken the two bad ones apart. You have to drill out the bottom plastic piece then push out the circuit. From the little testing I've done so far, my best guess so far is that the little buzzer on the circuit board is the part that fails over time. If I can locate replacement buzzers, I will try to fix the units. The buzzer is a Kingstate KSG8406 which is made in Taiwan. I've found the manufacturers website, but no retail source.

I must say I was dubious about the potential effectiveness of this technique of sonically repelling small animals. I followed the directions about placement and after about a month we noticed that we no longer have gopher tunnels in our organic vegetable garden of about 1200 sf. Because we are in a tiered garden arrangement we bought two Gopher-It's per 50' long tier, one for each end. This arrangement proved effective as long as I relocated the location about five feet every couple of months. Alkaline battery life is good, lasting about 7-9 months in moderate (never freezing) temperatures.

I've had them for several weeks (I'd say over 8 weeks) and the moles LOVE them!!! In fact, I've had increased activity where I've installed them.

The instruction manual could use some more detail, but studying the diagrams we were able to figure it out. Two of the bolts for attaching the bottom base to the rest of the dresser were poorly designed. We left them off because you would have had to take the bottom drawer track off to get the bolt to screw in. I don't think it is going to matter structurally though, because there are four other bolts holding it together.A few of the drawers were a little wobbly until the drawer bottom was secured in place. I thought that was one area that could be improved, the drawer construction.Overall, still a solid piece of furniture.

The songs have a relaxed storyteller theme, with plenty of emotion and just enough nostalgia mixed in.

I've owned this in album form, 8 track (remember those?) cassett,and now CD form since I wore out the others. I have most of his music and have been to several concerts and for me this is still, without a doubt his best stuff! This is the Key West bar singer and poet that would go \\"down to Fasto's to get chocolate milk\\" before he became commercialised and started \\"making music for money\\".

He took a great premise and turned it into a great story with engaging characters and a fast-paced plot.

It is an extraction of certain SSA publications, all available in user-friendly format at the official SSA website. The major drawback is that the tables of values for benefits and earnings limits stop at the year 2002. The edition I received in January, 2003 is the third edition dated May, 2002.

I commend his efforts to not only understand my confusion after my own conversations with the SSI, but to research the issue himself, once again, with their representatives.

All of a sudden, I wasn't just \\"watching\\" a scene with a diver chick and a couple of middle aged men standing on a beach in Tahoe, but I was standing there with them - listening to the conversation, feeling the chill air, smelling the lake. Todd Borg has a talent for drawing a reader into a story.An of course there's Spot. As the bookmark says, \\"Spot Rocks!\\" For most of the book, he's a bit more of a minor character than in Blowup, but he's still hanging about, drooling, lazing around, and making new friends.I'm happy with my purchase, and recommend this book to anyone that wants a quick enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK!!!","review":"Borg writes with a style that makes writing books seem easy.

Vaughan was discharged in 1944 and so he did not participate in the final months of the war.In an afterword Vaughan apologizes that his memory of events was not clear enough to permit him to describe his own experiences very well, and his attempts to obtain documents describing the CIC's actions during the war were unsuccessful, as many of these had been lost or destroyed.The book has a few photos, vaguely captioned, and a number of newspapers and other documents that pertain somewhat to Vaughan's story, but on the whole the book is clumsily written and maddeningly uninformative.Lesson learned: if you have an interesting story to tell, don't wait five decades before you decide to tell it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this tv","review":"I just want to say this tv for the price is with out a doubta great buy. the picture in HD is great the sound is greatand the tv really is an eye catcher .

During the installation process, without any abnormal pulling, the covers started to rip at the seams. Before anyone had even sat on the covers, there were large holes ripped in the seams. We immediately contacted Amazon who quickly offered to replace the covers for us. We thought (hoped?) perhaps this might be an isolated incedent, but no such luck. The exact same thing happened with the next set. Apparently the price WAS too good to be true. Coverking must be able to keep the price low because of the quality of the fabric and stitching.

If you'd like to see a mystery that really keeps you involved, esp. the first time you see it, then D.O.A. will do the job. O'Brien also does a good job of portraying a man who goes from self-centered, womanizing lush to tough, grown-up, determined hero because of the torment he's going through. Small budget but great pace. And in 1950, O'Brien was more than capable of handling all the action/running scenes.

And throughout all this, in my opinion, one of the finest peformances by an actor ever caught on film. Edmond O'Brien goes through the emotional roller coster of this role without ever stopping to take a breath. He will have you gasping for your breath up until the last frame. Once the credits start to roll, you will be just as exhausted after having gone on this ride. Then you will know you just watched a masterpiece of what is called Film Noir.

Don't read this if you are depressed it will keep you depressed and don't read this if you are happy it will make you depressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"depths by henning mankell","review":"I have practically read all of Henning Mankell's books and enjoyed most of them, especially the Kurt Wallander mysteries.This books is different from most of the others and somewhat depressing. This was not my cup of tea, maybe if you are a mariner you may appreciate the research gone into putting this book together, but I certainly didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you sure that Henning Mankell wrote this?","review":"I am such a huge fan of Henning Mankell and was so very disappointed in this book. I couldn't finish it. I was reading it on my iPad and checked the front of the book to make sure this was by Mankell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noir, very noir","review":"Probably this novel is very well written. But... the character is very dark and gets worse as the story evolves. Mankell has written many delightful stories. Wallander and non Wallander like The Man From Beijing. Mr Mankell can certainly weave a story and in Depths he does that superbly, though not to my liking."},{"rating":"1","title":"bury it deep","review":"Can not say much good about this one.

Short chapter format showed weakness in structural continuity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to Wallander","review":"I loved Henning Mankell's Wallender books so I bought this one. It was very bleak and I could not get drawn into the story. I was glad when the main character died because at least there will be no more books about him."},{"rating":"1","title":"It stinks!","review":"I've read a lot of Henning Mankell - including most of the Wallender books (which I love) so I picked up The Depths with great anticipation. Sadly, it was a huge disappointment, and I'm sorry I a) bought it and b) read it. Personally, I don't like books where there's no one to root for. I prefer to have at least one character in the story that is at least complex enough to have both good and bad characteristics - somebody human, approachable, realistic - like you would meet in real life. Nobody in The Depths is worth rooting for - they are all despicable or pathetic, and you hope bad things happen to them as they are all nuts or victims. Frankly, this was a better written version of Greg Isles' \\"Third Degree\\" which was one of the worst books I've ever read. Mankell wrote the book in his typically great style, but the substance wasn't there to carry the day. Avoid this one & read \\"Kennedy's Brain\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing mankell searching new depths","review":"I ahve read all of Henning Mankels books in English and have thoroughly enjoyed them until now. Depths disappoints at many levels and I wonder if Mr Mankel has grown bored with the writing that has made him famous and now seeks literary acclaim. If this book was written by anyone else it would probably receive favourable reviews as an arty literary fable ......but I wouldn't have bought it. Please Mr Mankel if you have a need to write such turgid nonsense do so under another name and spare your fans. (I even enjoyed return of the Dancing master!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible.","review":"This book was cold and bland. It never drew me in and it wasn't all that entertaining either.

My tv developed a dark bar on the left side of the screen after 15 months (out of warranty). It turns out that this is a known issue these tv's and well documented in several online forums. It seems there is some glue that secures small mirrors in the unit that fails causing the mirrors to move. This causes the \\"shadow\\" issue along the sides of the screen.

Take the time to review internet forums on Samsung DLP televisions. This type of failure appears to be very common.I have contacted Samsung corporation about warranty extension and repair. They refuse to even consider my request, despite the fact that many people on Samsung DLP internet forums feel Samsung knew during the manufacturing of this product it would experience early extensive failure. There is even talk of class action lawsuits. Hey, it is two months out of warranty, so tough luck, customers.I now am in possession of high priced inoperable junk. My next television?

The lamp manufacturer stated that if it was a malfunction with the lamp it would have failed within the first 60 days and that it was a malfunction in the TV. After paying over $3,000 for a television, you would think that it would last longer than three years.All attempts at getting through to Samsung have resulted in being disconnected.

The book discusses the domains of Necropolis, Darkon, Lamordia and Falkovnia. The author provides numerous potential starting points for adventures as well as ideas for developing the attitudes and histories of people from these lands. Also, the book gives insights into the newly returned Azalin and raises questions about why Azalin is interested in collecting information about all the different domains. I found the descriptions about Necropolis to be particularly useful since I have been eager to discover the nature of that domain. Altogether the book is an important addition to the Ravenloft collection and I encourage anyone who is interested in running a campaign in the northern realms to add this book to their library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good from begining to end.","review":"The Second of the Gazetteer's is an absoulutly solid product, We get an update and a real good look at one of the largest domains in Ravenloft, Darkon. Also are some really detailed looks at Necropolis, Lamordia, and Falkovnia. My personal favorite was Lamordia as I have always been interested in getting a closer look at the land of Mordenheim and Adam. Also the Who's Doomed section of this Gazetteer is packed. Not only the Darklords but 5 other personalities of note,(though you kinda figure Mordenheim as half a Darklord i guess.)

As little as 7 drops is lethal. Fluoride has been scientifically proven to cause bone cancer, lower IQ, increase heavy metals adsorption, inhibit over 60 enzymes needed in your body, and other cognitive problems and damage to organs.

They were what they were, influenced by the Civil War and of the Reconstruction era that followed.The characters had their flaws but at the same time were as real as Ring Lardners characters were to Northers readers.

(How he managed to do so is still beyond me! But as far as understanding Tolkien's work -- Ready does not. The research is sloppy, there are factual inaccuracies and his understanding of the role of Catholicism in Tolkien (both his life and in his work) is faulty. This is probably the single worst piece of Tolkien literary criticism that I have ever read.It is interesting to note that the book is panned in Carpenter's official biography of Tolkien. Apparently the family had the same view of the book as I do!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This hobbit agrees. . .","review":". . .with the previous reviewer. This book is AWFUL! I strongly suggest that if Mr. Ready (the former acquisitions librarian at Marquette University) had written this garbage PRIOR to purchasing the manuscripts for the university archives, the sale would never have been made.Hobbits, as everyone should know, like books which set forth things that are already known, fair and square with no contradictions. The average hobbit knows more about the life of the great Professor Tolkien than (apparently) does Mr. Ready. The inconsistencies and errors begin with the basic biographical information -- and continue downhill.All the author has demonstrated, is that he does NOT understand EITHER JRR Tolkien OR The Lord of the Rings."},{"rating":"2","title":"concise description of spiritual world","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this easy, yet deep read.

Highly disappointing, mostly a retelling of the story. Tolkien fans will find this a superfluous rehash of tired ideas, and non-fans will just be bored. Tolkien's Elves are not the flittery creatures of Victorian storybooks? Middle Earth is a translation of the Old Norse/Anglo-Saxon term for our world? Is there anyone on earth who hasn't known that since 1972 (or if they're under age 30, since they first encountered \\"The Hobbit\\" in grade school?)When Stanton does hit upon an idea that may be interesting, he drops it immediately, with no development. If this book is for Tolkien aficionados, it needs to be about 100 pages longer, with a better scholarly apparatus, or at least an acknowledgement that other people have written about these books before. If it is an attempt to capitalize upon the movie, it needs to be a lot more entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"a WONDERFUL aid to understanding and appreciating LOTR","review":"If you want to get more out of your readings of LORD OF THE RINGS, this book will help you a great deal. As a relative neophyte to Tolkien's grand epic, I was occasionally confused by the myriad place and name variants, and the huge vistas of time that are covered and referred to in the books. Stanton's book is extremely useful for all of these concerns, is very readable, and is also organized in a very clear way. If you want to go back and read only about, say, the Ents, you can easily do so. Stanton taught LOTR and Tolkien for 25 years in classes at the Univ. of Vermont, and it shows. He also makes a point of thanking his many students, who over the years have given him additional insights into this great work of literature.Great reading, and very very helpful. It's going on my shelf next to my LOTR set."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good place to start exploring Middle Earth.","review":"I just reread \\"Lord of the Rings\\" (having not read it since high school) and picked up Stanton's book as the first criticism in advance of seeing the film. As a starting point, it's a very good guide to the initial critical arguments surrounding LOR. It's a fine an affectionate summary of all the work done to date and it really provided some good insights, at least to my mind, about how to read the books as a whole. After you read Stanton, you can use his thoughtful bibliography to go further in Tolkien criticism. I'm now on to the work of Jane Chance, but Stanton's book was a solid bedrock from which to go forth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Collection of Peaceful Music","review":"I was drawn to this CD because of one of the cuts.

Smoky is probably one of his best known books and most read book, also. A movie version was brought out in the mid-1960s, and it still shows on Encore westerns from time to time.And sometimes a classic book such as this one even appeals to an old buckaroo (age 65) such as myself.

Will James gives us a wonderful picture of life on the range. The dialect of the narrator (a fellow cowboy for certain) and his descriptions are so vivid you can taste the dust in the air as you read.The trials and tribulations of Smoky will teach children many valuable lessons about how horses think and what makes man good or bad in the eyes of that horse.

The fact that Smoky was stolen and that his owner determined to find him was an important part of the plot, and I felt empathy toward both horse and human. At the time I read this book, I knew beans about sentence structure and writing style, and I had all the time in the world to read, so I never thought the long descriptions slowed things down. I suspect that today I would think the writing was overly descriptive. However, I loved Will James' drawings back then, and I love them now.

A book like this should be read as carefully as it has been written and then the practices put to work, preferably under supervision - I am sure that is the intention."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRAVO !","review":"I am astonished that CQY makes me crave the recreation of historical events that have changed the course of mankind while satisfying my need for a great vampire novel.

Seeing Saint-Germain in slightly less elegant surroundings. Seeing Saint-Germain placed in a Catch-22 situation. Hugenot Dislikes: Jenfra: she was a brat, and she almost got Saint-Germain killed. Strengths: The historical setting, the feeling of hopelessness, the sheer scope of the plague. Weakness: Even though it's historically accurate, it's difficult to believe (from a 1990's pov) that any culture could be so suicidally stupid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended","review":"Sound through the speakerphone varies based on how loud an automated attendant is.

However, this edition has little in the way of extras. However, given the price, its not a bad deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ignore the politics, enjoy the movie","review":"This movie is a tale that could happen, and that makes it compelling. The anti-drug company message is a little overbearing, but it works.Certainly, there are evil corporations in the world, and the plot is mostly plausible. On the whole, it's easy to believe that the events portrayed in the movie could occur - after all, the U.S. government has numerous times experimented on its own citizens. Look up the Tuskegee Experiment for an example. There are a thousand other examples of government doing evil to its own citizens. That's why I was kept spellbound throughout.The acting and cinematography are gorgeous. The African settings were wonderful and felt authentic.This is a murder mystery with an underdog hero and an ending that will leave you in a very meditative state of reflection on your own humanity. How do you treat those around you? This is a good flick with lots of inneundo and gripping drama. The characters feel like real people and I like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its advertised as a thriller but no thrills!!!","review":"Well the story, its a copy of traffic but not where near that class probably as traffic dealt with a real problem that many of us could appreciate. This film is like a cold war movie set in modern times where the local and British government are helping two huge drug companies test their drugs on poor Africans. Of course, just about everyone in the local country knows about it and is involved somehow but are two heroes have to struggle to find the truth.The acting, I thought was extremely wooden. No actor inspired me with his or her performance. Maybe it was what the director wanted so it would not take over the story but if so to me, it back fired and reduced my interest even more."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Constant Gardener","review":"I'm starting to appreciate John LeCarre novels more than I did when he was all over the bestseller list. This film version of one was acted well, but in 30 minutes there just wasn't anything to engage my interest. Not its characters and not its plot. A good cause worth building a story around, but not this story. I quit watching, so I guess I could be wrong, but I doubt it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Constant Gardener","review":"We found this movie too long for the story line. It was a typical who done it. It was hard to hear what some of the actors were saying. Overall, boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted opportunity","review":"This could have been such a good movie. Despite its clichéd plot (big business bad) the settings and character development could have been great. Instead the director decided to just run with the clichés and ignore the rest. The cinematography was trying too hard to seem artistic using jerky, erratic motion and subdued hues. It could have been very beautiful but was just distracting.The plot was very clichéd and simplistic. It totally ignored the other factors in the region like corrupt governments (well, not totally but enough to seem so) and makes the African people seem like victims who need help from the \\"white man\\" instead of the strong people that they are.Overall this movie was a just a huge disappointment to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I blame the editor","review":"The Constant Gardener's story is a polemic that could have been told in 1/2 hour .The theme is: 'Multinational drug companies are run by unscrupulous bastards who will stop at nothing, whether it be falsifying the results of clinical drug trials in Africa, to killing anyone who gets in their way. Drug companies have the same morals as arms manufacturers and most Western governments.\\"Gee .... never would have worked that out for myself !!!!!Ralph Fiennes is rather easy on the eyes, however, so I will give the film 2 stars, rather than none.

Impossible to watch without getting queasy. Slow, slow moving plot and tons of worthless scenes (all the while moving the camera with what must have been a horrid hangover)- save yourself 2 hours and just read a one sentence review.Sucks, sucks, SUCKS BADLY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strangely boring","review":"I was prepared for some self-righteous, simplistic, liberal preachiness (you get a full blast right away, with \\"war for oil\\" pontificating - are actors and directors just too busy to get themselves educated on reality? I'll wager that none of them is aware of the latest scoop - documents have recently been translated that prove Saddam was training terrorists), ...... but what I wasn't prepared for was how BORING it turned out to be - not to mention physically painful to watch, because of the purposely over-jerky camera.Apart from these issues, it is interesting to see our perception of Mrs. Quayle change, and if the premise is true, it exposes a truly horrific pharmaceutical practice. (Of course, it pales in comparison with an even bigger scandal - the prescribing of extremely toxic AIDS \\"drugs\\" to people who are probably only suffering from diseases of poverty - see rethinkingaids, aliveandwell, etc.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Africa, Big Business & Colonalism","review":"The Constant Gardener is a film that explores many themes; marriage, faith, love, greed, poverty, and cultural differences. The cinematography of Africa and all of its beauty and humanity are emotionally captured. The plot involving British intellegence, corporate pharmaceutical capitalism, and African societal explotation are melded together. This aspect of the film is confusing. It is often difficult to identify which characters are agents, spys, doctors, dignitaries, politicians, and murderers. What is beautifully crafted is the relationship that exists between Dr. Quale ( Ralph Fiennes) and his activist wife Tessa ( Rachael Weisz). After Tessa's death Dr. Quale comes to the realization that his doubts and suspicions concerning his wife were unfounded. In reality he learns more about his wife's inner soul after he researches the causes of her death. The ending of the movie was moving."},{"rating":"2","title":"The dark side of post-colonial Africa","review":"Fernando Meirelles, off of his success with City of God, reveals another dark environment - post-colonial Africa. The story revolves around a career diplomat searching for secrets of his wife's tragic death. Stunning imagery and a dark tale is told - contains a realistic (I'd guess) portrait of some dirty deeds that may actually be going on. Assumes the worst in post-colonial behavior from Western powers, which may be a turnoff for some. The pace can be slow, which can be a turnoff for others. Certainly an interesting and eye-openning movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning for those prone to motion sickness","review":"I can't honestly tell you if the story is any good, because the cinematography was so awful. 80% or more of the scenes are shot by somebody stumbling around carrying the camera by hand; the picture was bouncy and wobbly and the result was intense motion sickness. The director also chose to \\"increase the suspense\\" by doing rapid cuts, many to off-angle shots, again with the camera held by the person who wobbles even when standing still. Since I had to spend 2/3 of the movie staring at the floor so I didn't throw up, so it's hard to say if the story was any good. I wish there was some way to have known this before I blew $9 on the movie, so that I could have seen something that I would have been able to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Constant Gardner, a true thought-provoker","review":"The Constant Gardener (Full Screen)This movie is sad and thought-provoking and at times very troublesome. One must have a strong stomach to watch parts of it. The music and scenes are lovely, and the portrayal of the African people is very touching indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly Surprised","review":"If you like sexy and intrigue, The Constant Gardener delivers magnificently on both. Believable is the chemistry between Fiennes and Weisz, as are the issues addressed in the world today, making this movie feel very real. Many times you want Fiennes to simply put his head back in the sand, you also want him to forge a head as the grizzly truths are as compelling as repulsive."},{"rating":"1","title":"I liked it but...","review":"The constant gardener was a \\"good\\" movie... not a \\"great\\" movie. It was a bit long and dry... had a couple of decent internal twists that you don't see coming right away. But in the final analysis a bit of a yawner for me.I like to buy my movies, I don't go see them in the theatre because I can own them for about the same money and enjoy them at home any time I wish. In this case... I wish I hadn't bought it.p.s.

Rio is helter skelter. Africa is relatively barren.The next to last scene at the refugee camp (fifteen minutes or so) could easily have been deleted for a much more effective pace leading to the final resolution. Reminds me of Bono preachifying in the middle of songs on U2's current tour. Just play the darn music Mr. Bono Man!The movie dies here before the protagonist does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely NOT a pleasure!","review":"I completely agree with reviewer Robert from Sydney. This movie is muddled, boring, confusing and preachy. Just another do-gooder against the oh so evil large corporations. The photography alone can give you a giant headache, trying to follow the hazy and sped up hand-cam like action jumping constantly from one place to another.Plot is completely loony.

Don't even waste your movie rental money on this lemon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed, but still a Fiennes fan!!","review":"I LOVE Ralph Fiennes & I loved the English Patient, but I was very disappointed by this movie in the theater. He's wonderful, but too long, too depressing, and it seemed like there was no real chemistry (the're in love, but you don't really understand why or how). I'll continue to watch all of his films, but if considering buying.......pass!"},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I could not watch the whole movie as I found it boring and not credible in parts (when Tessa erupts in an outburst at a lecture). Fiennes' character's reaction was not believable as Tessa came across as a petulant brainwashed student spouting all the rhetoric one is so used to hearing (and with le carre's predictable bias - USA bad UK bad WAR bad, blah blah...) I found Tessa's character cloying and could not identify enough with anyone in this film to make it thru the end. Glad I borrowed it from the library and didn't waste my $ on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monumental issues, but fails to convince","review":"I have been a Le Carre fan until the end of the Cold War. I somehow still managed to follow him later for some time. But now it is over, definitely. I disliked this novel, and the movie is obnoxious. Rachel Weisz is quite ridiculous in her part. Which idiot nominated her for her Oscar is beyond the point. Zellweger got an Oscar for an even more horrible performance recently, in the otherwise quite acceptable Cold Mountain. And even the otherwise great Blanchett had to turn in an awful performance in The Aviator to get one. (Why can these nice girls not get one for one of their good movies?)My conclusion: this world is strange. It has no idea what is good and what not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerhouse Story, Powerhouse Acting","review":"This is a must see film, Rachel Weisz and Ralph Fiennes are excellent in this and the film is very well written. My only complaint is the choppy camera work, it was disracting and made the movie seem cheap, perhaps they thought it would be artsy but I just thought it was annoying. A film of conviction and heart, powerful story's like this don't get made everyday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh.","review":"It was a well made movie, I'll give it that. But I just wasn't very engaged by it. If one really wants to protect someone, not just make a premise for a movie, I think it is typically a better idea to keep them well-informed than to keep them bumbling in the dark. The ethics of drug research is an interesting topic to me, but it was somehow dulled by the drama."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slow -- a mind-numbing 2+ hours","review":"While Ralph Finnes and Rachel Weisz are excellent actors, this film left me wondering how they managed to stay awake long enough to film their scenes. The plot of the movie was excellent, but that's about the end of it. The evil government and corporate operatives were so obvious as to be laughable. There was really no mystery here at all and the outcomes were predictable.My main beef was the glacial pace of the movie and the frentic camera work that made me want to put my popcorn down and grab some dramamine. At times, I found my eyes fluttering shut, as it was easier to just listen to the dialog rather than watch it.The main attraction of the movie was Africa itself and the occasional pauses in the film that let the beauty of the land and people shine through.If you must see it, be sure to load up on some coffee beforehand. Trust me, you'll need it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Constant Gardner movie","review":"This movie was really good and my service from the seller was awesome... I would buy from this seller again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable. Tired. Worn. Ragged.","review":"Constant Gardner is a suspense movie of international intrigue. Unfortunately, it is altogether predictable and weary.Imagine a big bad multinational pharmaceutical company conducting unethical experiments on poor tribal natives of Africa with a wink and nod from the British government. Add a diplomat with integrity and a young activist woman with a cause and you have the essence of the film.Pharmaceutical companies are easy targets and African natives are easy prey. The plot is simply too weary and threadbare to rouse either interest or excitement."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Gardener Is a Preacher?","review":"I love movies. I don't enjoy being preached to. From the anti-Iraq War tirade in one of the early scenes, to the actual plot, this \\"Capitalism: Bad,\\" \\"NGO: Good\\" message they tried to force feed me was not enjoyable.

It has got to be one of the most slow-moving, boring, uninteresting movies I have had the pain of having to waste my time on ~ while attempting to sit through it.

Don't waste your money and time on this dud, as I'm sorry I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it!","review":"From the bad cinematography to the under developed characters, and most of all to the stupid plot. I think this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! I cannot even begin to understand the 4 and 5 star reviews. The whole \\"issue\\" isn't even truly a major issue about Africa to begin with.

Her meek, weakling of a husband husband searches Africa, and Britain, and I think Germany or France or some other places (it doesn't matter), all leading up to the heart-stopping conclusion when he asks someone to mail him a letter exposing it all.The main character is a loser. I would rather have seen him strung up along with his wife so we could watch someone else's story.Or, if you would rather see a thrilling recent movie in an African setting with a social message, see Blood Diamond. That one is fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"This may not be the worse movie ever but certainly in the running.","review":"This was truly about the worse movie ever! The movie-makers need to know that we fully understand their simple view of the world: America bad! Business bad! America business really bad!! I guess the only good people in the whole world are those rich actors and rich movie makers that get richer and richer telling us how bad it is to be rich and oh, really bad to be American.

Worthless and counter productive!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Need a lot of caffiene to get through this movie.","review":"This might just be the most boring movie I have ever seen. It would be a real close race between this one, Lost in Translation, Broken Flowers, and Swimming Pool. Do you see a trend forming here? All of these movies were \\"Focus Features\\" films. I have given up with these title and will most likely stay away from Focus features in the future. What the critics seem to call artistic, and visionary, I just find absolutely mind-numbingly boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everybody is a Noble Victim","review":"Everything about this movie was about being a victim. The evil corporations, the impotent and diseased Colonial government, the crusader who (of course) was murdered for standing-up for her beliefs.

Very predictable ending as well.Sound track and scenery of Africa was well done, hence the 2 star rating"},{"rating":"1","title":"racial and big business politics collide","review":"Another movie about the great white hope coming to the aide of Africa's expandable and ignorant population. (sarcasm) Other than great cinmatography (it's very pretty) this movie has very little going for it. I, too, didn't believe the 'love' story and I'm ify ify on whether Weisz prformance was worthy of an Oscar. Everyone just confessed to what was going on...so I fail to see how any of it was a secret with so many loose lips involved. I'm sorry this hardly qualifies as a thriller...at no point was I glued to the edge of seat. Seems to me if the woman had just established a blog-we wouldn't have had much of a film. Bottomline: A pretty boring film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't explain why","review":"But even thought I fully expected to enjoy this movie (I've enjoyed Ralph's work in the past), I couldn't bring myself to do so.

I'm not sure what Tessa's profession was, nor am i interested, but i think she liked going to other countries to help out certain people.Very slow moving and boring.

We are bad UN is good; and this is only after the first ten minutes into the movie.I think that John LeCarre figured out that the only way to get one of his novels made into a movie is to write a leftist formulaic type novel. I wonder, if the novel was about the corruption of the African goverments and the United Nations.....? would a movie be made on that theme..........hm !Probably ............. NOT !I bought this movie without reading the novel based on how much I enjoyed Smiley's People and Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.

I threw it in the trash!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite a Good Love Story in Interesting Locales!","review":"Rachel Weisz won a much-deserved Oscar for best supporting actress for her role in \\"The Constant Gardener\\". Her marriage to Ralph Fiennes' character, which we are to believe is merely a marriage of convenience, is, as we come to find out, really much more. Their relationship, not the rather intricate plot, is really the heart of the movie and is memorable & quite touching.

Spies, betrayal, lies, and manipulations destroy a cultured life. Suddenly, the world around him is revealed, and he realizes that he was living in a world separated from the real world.Sure, the Brits make for some slow moments, but their is also a lot of action, henchmen, and plot twists to keep you interested. More is revealed, as the movie unfolds, and we sympathize with those affected by the complicated governmental \\"influences.\\"There are cultural and other aspects of this film which give it added power and which give the viewer more perspective. I do not want to give anything away, but this movie provides drama, action, and mystery. This is not a James Bond or Bourne film, but the action sequences balance the calm, slower scenes. Both women and men would enjoy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies of 2005","review":"Lots of negative criticism has been generated about this movie. About the politics, about the story, about the way they play with time and flashbacks. It all maybe true, but it is still one of the most beautiful and intelligent movies out there.It starts by doing something not many movies are able to do, that is best their literary origin; \\"the Constar Gardener\\" film is much better than TCG book. And that is a lot to say John LeCarre being the author.Fernando Meirelles the director fills the screen with astounding visuals, that jump out of the screen and hit you in the face like saying \\"keep looking, do not miss a beat\\". And what to say of the acting, Fiennes, Weist and all the supporting cast are at their best, conveying emotion right thru your heart.One of the best examples of great moviemaking in recent years. If you can look over politics and such you deserve to enjoy this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the attention","review":"This is an excellent movie eventhough the story does have its dull minutes. The intriging plot and the different personalities of the film characters keep you focused from the beginning. Along with the great mix the director made of both Africa's beauty and cruelty, this movie was worth the 2 hours of attention, which is a very rare thing these days in the first place. Especially for a non-action movie! When human right activist Rachel Weisz finds out about a dark secret in the pharmaceutical industry in Africa, she pays the highest price for that. When her husband Ralph Fiennes starts investigating her death, he starts to discover some things about his wife he had never known. This movie gives you a way better idea of Africa than silly stuff like Beyond borders, Sahara and Indiana Jones. (SARR)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...","review":"Yep. Pharma companies are evil.

It would have benefitted from some judicious cutting to make it a little leaner.

Why are you being redundant?The only plus for my wife and I was the acting, which was great.

THis movie is long slow and boring. Also, the jerky camera movements used to simulate hand held camera work are a tired and overused cinamatographical tool. The plot was the same old liberal tripe about the Evil Drug Companies. After watching this movie i really began to understand how out of touch hollywood is with the rest of the world. This movie is a total crock.Only watch this movie if you're trying to kill yourself through boredom."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Constant Cliche","review":"A leftist activist fights the good fight against evil big business on behalf of poverty stricken AIDS patients. Gee, this is really original Hollywood fare, isn't it? Her alliance with a gay African doctor rounds out the politcally-corrrect cast of characters. I expected much more than the same old hackneyed left-wing tripe this cliched formula movie serves up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves much to be desired.......","review":"Producers please take note: wildly moving cinematography can be used to show movement or a first person perspective, but when used throughout the entire movie in nearly every scene, it merely comes across as amateurish. Honestly, the cinematography in this film is something I would expect from a group of high-school kids putting together their first film for a class. The fact that somebody actually thought this would be a good idea for a major motion picture is beyond comprehension to me. Watch this movie and try NOT to get a headache. I turned it off before it was over, though I did sit (suffer) through 90% of it. It must also be averred that this is an easy movie to turn off....the story is simply not a compelling one at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated and kind of boring","review":"I thought this movie was kind of blah, the characters were not interesting, it kept reverting to previous scenes (in his mind), and nothing really happened.

The wife fell asleep right away in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good thriller but absurd and misleading","review":"This movie was beautifully filmed and well acted, a good thriller and a treat for Fiennes fans. BUT what a ridiculous plot. Are people so overwhelmed by the relentlessly negative media coverage of pharmaceutical prices that it has become plausible that a pharmaceutical company functions like a cross between the KGB and the Mafia? Even as I was touched by the romance of it, I choked on the silly plot developments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Film of 2005","review":"I adored this movie. It is a political thriller + love story + mystery. Ralph Fiennes' quite performance shows his character fall more in love with his wife after her death. His growth and development is as fascinating as the gripping plot. Please only view if you have an attention span that can last two hours. Otherwise, you will be lost and bored."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creation versus Consumption","review":"This is a very slight book, both in size and in content. The Gardener creates the food that the King and his followers thoughtlessly consume. One works outside with nature. The other feasts inside his glorious castles. Only one of the two can ultimately survive. The book is more of a collection of anecdotes about Gardener and King than a straightforward novella. It lacks depth.Mystery: The original French version has 191 pages. This English translation has only 116 pages. What happened? Somebody should 'fess up."},{"rating":"2","title":"not as good as the original... but still Texas country!! :)","review":"the first 'Brewed in Texas' i think is better than this one. but there are a still a few songs on here that i enjoyed and i'm glad i found out it was available."},{"rating":"1","title":"MISSED OUT ON THIS ONE","review":"This CD would not play in my computer.

Her incorporation of the personal stories of victims of the Pol Pot regime's Tuol Sleng extermination center helps readers better understand the atmosphere of those terrible days.

It can all be a little forboding, but the music is so cleverly constructed and the album flows so nicely, it never bogs you down. In fact, you'll probably want to put the CD player on repeat and just listen to it over and over.Heavily influenced by the classic \\"4AD sound,\\" \\"Livonia\\" is full of dark melodies, gentle female vocals, sound collages, and the occasional near-heavy-metal guitar outburst.

What an amazing tribute to birth for children to read with parents. I was lucky enough to find a used copy for about $15, but having it now, I would have paid $50 for it easily.

Although this is not a CD which can be classified as memorable it is an interesting and historical reminder of the music of the later years of this decade.

If you haven't worked with those before, then you wouldn't know that it's a pain to get them to shift to the backside of the binder ring when you close the binder. Bring in sheet lifters. You place one in the front of the binder so that when you close it, it shifts all the pages such that they lay flat in the binder. It makes it SO much better. I ended up buying a few sets. This brand seems well-constructed and sturdy, so I'm not worried about longevity. For people that say they feel flimsy - I ask, compared to what? And what are you doing to them that would cause them to break?!?"},{"rating":"2","title":"There are TWENTY (20) Sheet Lifters","review":"I could never find these sheet lifters (or guards) when buying three-ring binders at the local office-supply store.

But we got the camera to use it with AIM which is what the rest of our distributed family uses. Alas, neither AIM 5.9 nor AIM Triton displays anything from the the camera. Creative's support has been frustrating. They have suggested a number of things to do if the camera doesn't work at all, ignoring the fact that I've told them where the camera does work, and that we get the same results on two very different computers.The problem may be with AIM, but then Creative's website and tech support should just say that, instead of encouraging users to think that it does work.

OR, you can \\"watch it online - FREE\\".I just caught it again on PBS-tv, and it's every bit as wonderful and touching as when I first saw it decades ago.

It is nearly impossible to find in its original running time of 120 minutes (most DVD's now list it at 117 minutes); the last company to market a clear, crisp 120 minute version was Republic Pictures Home Video (on tape and laserdisc).

A good formula might be that if you take most of his roles and try to put any other actor in them to see how they would turn out.For Example, \\" My Favorite Wife\\" , one of the three teamings of Dunne and Grant( this film and \\" The Awful Truth\\" are the others), was remade with Doris Day and James Garner, two pretty fare comedic actors themselves.It is pretty painful to watch this film if you have seen Grant and Dunne go at it.Their timimg is uncanny, the close ups are multi dimensional, and in this sentimental film ,their interplay is unique. \\" Penny Serenade\\" gives us a real look into this teams total charisma on the screen. Their future is somehow buried in their past love for each other. Edgar Buchanon( former dentist) acts as an interface for their problems.

I cried so hard thru a couple of scenes - it has always been a memorable film to me. I bought this particular DVD to replace my VHS version. This DVD version is missing a key scene, where Roger goes before the judge concerning the adoption of Trina. I cannot believe this scene would be cut - it is very important. The movie itself is pretty clean, considering the age of the movie and that it is not remastered. I would give the movie itself at least 4 stars, but 1 star for the fact it has been cut."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANOTHER BAD SERENADE!!!","review":"It is impossible to find a decent print of this film. Several years ago, Republic Home Video had a decent tape and laser disc verson of this film which featured the entire 119 minutes of the movie.

I bought 5 of these Madacy DVDs and will return all of them. I am not usually very picky about quality. A good VHS tape is just wonderful to me. These DO NOT COME CLOSE TO VHS!The sound quality is so bad, I couldn't get through the film. The hiss is not only audible, it drowns out the soundtrack. The picture has weird artifacts that I have never seen before. I could have tolerated them, but the audio hiss gave me a headache. My guess is that the publisher bought a $2.99 VHS tape of these movies and transferred the tape to DVD. No noise reduction whatsoever. Its like listening to a cheap cassette on a $5.00 walkman--I kid you not! You could do just as good a job in your basement with a VHS tape player and a DVD writer. Come on Madacy, you could have at least supressed that hiss!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For the money, probably the best print you will find","review":"Penny Serenade is so great because it is a complete departure by Cary Grant from his normal comedy scene. If you are a fan of Cary Grant or even Irene Dunne than this is a movie for your collection. Told in a series of flashbacks according to Julie Adams (Irene Dunne) as she is contemplating divorce and looking through a stack of old photos. The trip is one down memory lane. Grant gives a great performance in this drama with some critical comedy.Grant has always been somewhat of a character actor by genre. FromHis Girl Friday (Enhanced Edition) - 1940toCharade - Anamorphic Widescreen Edition (Criterion Collection Spine #57)and evenTopper / Topper Returns (Enhanced Edition) 1941, Cary Grant has always been a comedy superstar.

Penny Serenade on this DVD did not contain the portion where Cary Grant masterfully pleads to the judge to adopt the child, despite his lack of employment.

The narration by AJ, the reluctant school-goer, is engaging and the character of Mrs. Loopy is well-drawn and entertaining. Throughout the book Mrs. Loopy makes attempts to liven up books for AJ in order to turn him into someone who doesn't hate books. Judging by how well the author lured my son (a reluctant reader) into the book, Mrs. Loopy met her objective.IMPORTANT NOTE: I am an elementary school teacher and found three parts of the book objectionable.1) Mrs. Loopy pulls up her shirt to show a tattoo to AJ and his classmates.2) AJ and his classmates break into Mrs. Loopy's office instead of lining up with the rest of their class.3) In the last chapter AJ grabs Mrs. Loopy's shirt and pulls it out in order to have visual access to her belly button.An enjoyable read, but be aware of those parts before you read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mrs Roopy review","review":"Hilarious.

His work is well-written, but becomes superficial because he focuses on the more \\"sensational\\" stories of Amish youth who struggle with their beliefs. Imagine writing about that small percentage of non-Amish adolescents who are struggling with their identity, the use of drugs and alcohol, and are losing the battle -- and you have Mr. Schachtman's book. The \\"twist,\\" of course, is the use of Amish youth, and his efforts to critique their culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"more than the sum of it's parts","review":"This is a great book for anyone curious about Amish culture and motivations. I thought it was going to be a sensational peek into the wild behavior of Amish teen-agers but it was more about the beliefs of the sect, the history of their religion, and certain changes in their culture that have been the result of interacting and competing with the English community. I found it very hard to put down once I started reading. And yes there are a enough scandalous passages to satisfy the vicarious minded. One glaring oversight, however,is the lack of information about the sexual practices of married couples, their personal interaction, and the depth of intimate exchange."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shamefully all-inclusive","review":"I'm so disappointed in this book. The author makes a very common mistake, one which leads to stereotyping and generalizations.

There appears to be no organizing principle, and as a result we get one anecdote after another, many of them redundant.There are glaring omissions--the author says next to nothing about their language. They all seem to speak English. Although he makes occasional offhand remarks about certain people speaking Pennsylvania Dutch occasionally, he does not bother to mention it otherwise.

I was a big fan of the first \\"ring\\", but obviously they went in a different direction with \\"two\\". There were probably a couple of cool scenes the whole movie, otherwise I was bored stiff. They didn't make much of an effort to follow the first movie. The first movie had excellent direction, cinematography and very good use of the surround sound channels. The new movie appears to have had a 10th of the budget the first had. The deer scene was obviously CGI and NOT scarey. The bathtub scene was apparently what the movies budget was spent on, kind of a matrix bullet time rip off. Looked good, but NOT scarey! This movie probably doesn't deserve one star, but it influenced a whole series of new movies...grudge, constantine, ect. Don't even waste your time renting it. I'm serious."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY ,VERY, VERY, SCARY","review":"Hello my name is Karen and this movie is very scary. I went to see it yesterday and it's all ready giving me nightmares.

Samara just standing there, floating towards people, arms out, hair in face....oooohhhh I'm scared!! Oh, and there's a scene with killer attack deer! Oooohhhh....even more scary! Digital attack deer are NOT scary. Was this movie made by the Wayans brothers? Finally, how can you make a movie scary when you put Lumberg from Office Space in it? C'mon....Lumberg for crying out loud?!?! I thought he was going to ask Samara if she got the memo about the cover sheets for the TPS reports!The first Ring was great!! Scary, good story, good plot and characters etc. It was a real original. I wish this one was never made and/or I never saw it.

The Ring was a good movie not great but good and of course with horror films there is a sequal. This movie is bad and I mean bad it's more funny then scary. There are such stupid and pointless parts that leave you think what where they thinking. The movie draged on and on and on I just wanted it to end.

This is one of those types of movies that don't have to be made. But don't wet your pants when you see it. It's so predictible. This follows up to the original movie. Where we find Rachel and her son (Can't remember the name) going to a diffrent town to escape that creepy little girl. She finds out that the evil tape has been viewed. (Apparently they don't know about DVD. I don't know maybe there saving that for Ring 3: The search for more money). The little boy is more scary than that girl. Normally I give movies like this a one but seeing that I jumped at a part I didn't see coming I'll give it a 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just trying to stay alive","review":"This movie isnt all that good as the first one.It seems just like a way to keep the ring one alive.The girl samara misses her mother and wants to take over the boys body.Comon you can do better.It wasnt all that scary either.The grudge was better.In the ring 2 it was to good but i might still buy it .The first one was better."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Were They Thinking?","review":"The Ring was one of those rare good horror movies. It was original, suspenseful, with good directing and acting. The Ring 2 is boring. It relies heavily on special effects, and the effects are good, but seem to be largely a means to their own end. Naomi Watts is a good actress, who really upped her credibility with Mulholland Drive; I have to wonder what she was thinking when she signed on for this sad part-two drivel. Maybe she signed before actually seeing the script.And what's with the deer? Sure, it's cool to see them attack the car, but why? Really? And why just deer? Why not other wildlife? Why don't psychotic squirrels attack, too, or chipmunks? Or are horned ruminants the only ones affected by Water Girl?Dumb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this one...","review":"This is the first horror movie I have seen in several years from a major studio that had not ONE scary moment in it (the only scene that worked in any way, shape, or form, was the one involving the deer... I won't spoil it for you). The eerieness of the kid in the movie (that worked fairly well in the first Ring) is gone, now that the kid looks like a teenager. And the spooky comments he made in the first are totally lost in this sequel. Do yourself a favor, rent the original Japanese version of the first Ring... avoid this one.Just by way of background, and while other reviewers seems to prefer to reveal much of the story and plot, I think that sort of ruins the film in many cases.

In places it contradicts the first film, and the few good moments weren't worth the cost of a rental, let alone a purchase price. One of those flicks where the anticipation is better than the film. It never draws the viewer in, and somehow, you wind up not caring who wins or loses, and instead of cheering for a hero, you wind up rooting for the credits.Having said that, there really are some good moments, but it wasn't enough for me to consider putting this title on my shelf.Maybe I'll rent the Japanese version to see if it's better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Good As The Original....","review":"I never thought The Ring... part 1 was a great movie. I just found it ok. To me, not scary or creepy enough. After watching The Ring Two, I tend to prefer part one to this sequel.

Felt like a silly kid's movie.I was pleasantly suprised to see the lovely Emily Van Camp (Everwood)for the opening ten minutes. Probably the only redeeming feauture in the film (in my opinion).I have no use for this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"SKIP IT","review":"I loved the creepiness of The Ring. It genuinely got under your skin, with its glimpses into the life and death of Samara, one of the most disturbing evil children in the movies. This sequel is a tepid and absurd attempt to joggle thrills out of virtually nothing. Samara's twisted life, which was still ripe for the picking, is abandoned; in its place, a slow-moving possession tale emerges. Once again, Naomi Watts is asked to run all over creation to track down clues, etc. -- but this time, there is no palpable terror in any of it. You simply don't care. It's a shame, because in some ways, it destroys the terror of the first Ring. This one didn't even get a shudder from me - and the audience I saw it with, largely teen girls, didn't scream once. No fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ewwwww","review":"the first one was only scary about 2 times. What is with every good japanese horror movie being copied.

I do have some info on this movie to share with you all. DAVEIGH CHASE WILL NOT BE RETURNING AS SAMARA MORGAN!!!!! So if you liked cute little Daveigh Chase as creepy little Samara Morgan (or shall I say Sadako Yamamura) you will be very disapointed (as I was)."},{"rating":"2","title":"as sequels go, well done","review":"Well it certainly wasn't as good as the first but still it was an effective movie. Again Naomi Watts did a marvelous job. Another great albeit very small performance was Sissy Spacek. too bad they couldn't have had her character in more. Anyway it was a solid thriller with much of the creepiness we would expect. I'm hoping for a little better on the third one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are sequels ever good?","review":"The Ring 2 was definately different from the first. I have to admit, I was not a fan of The Ring--I found it to be rather boring, but it's pretty great compared to the sequel. The Ring 2 has a completely different storyline..it's not about a crazy little girl trying to kill people through a videotape anymore. Now it's focusing on Samara trying to get Rachel to be her mother.....Not too interesting.There are a few scenes with pop-outs or loud music..but other than that, this movie was pretty uneventful. I felt that is was just lacking something..maybe it just needed a stronger plot or more terror scenes..I'm not really sure..but all in all, I found it to be quite boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as good as the american original","review":"\\"The Ring 2\\" is great entertainment and \\"almost\\" as frightening as \\"The Ring.\\" I won't reveal the plot like so many others do on this review site, but the screenplay is very adequate for a sequel.

Widescreen is only in the \\"Unrated\\" edition, which for a collector is extremely disappointing.Movie itself has a few chills and is worth having, but suffers from having similar problems of superior sequels (Fly II, Robocop 2 are good examples) in that, though they have their moments, are far too uneven and emotionally spastic to really draw an audience in to satisfy. The original is considered far superior, even if great effort is expended on the sequel (and it shows here).Main problem is theatrical version does not seem to exist in WIDESCREEN as it should. If I am wrong about this, please let me know, but I fail to understand this type of release format problem on this particular film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific scary sequel movie","review":"Before watching \\"The Ring Two\\", I have watched my three foreign horror movie DVD collections, \\"Ringu\\", \\"Ringu 2\\", and \\"Ringu 0: Birthday\\".

It is fine to watch, and as horror sequels go, it wasn't the worst. It continues the story, brings the villian back, and sort of gives a little more power to do so to our heroine, Rachel.Anytime a movie tries to go after the child we cringe a bit, but Aiden, as unresponsive as he always kind of was (and just a little creepy) we feel a little less for him and more of Rachel as the mother.The movie has the moments where we are dreading the loud \\"pop\\" scenes, as well as hoping for Samara just to leave them alone, but it offers a little more into her background as well.Overall, I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste Of Time","review":"Ring Two wasn't scary at all and though I was sad when the cute guy got killed there was really nothing to really comment about except it was pretty boring.

Remember that cheesy part with the scary Ring-like girl and the whole let's be a family thing? Well, it took Scary Movie 3 two minutes to make up that cheezy stuff, but the people from the Ring turned that into a sequel. So basically Scary Movie 3, which parodied The Ring, inspired this sequel. How truly sad. I wish I could get that hour and some odd minutes back, so I could watch a better scary movie.

I saw the trailer for The Ring Two and the trailer looked awesome so I saw it in the movie theater. The first fifteen minutes grabbed my attention then the movie just got even dumber and boring. The last hour is basically just everyone walking around talking about pointless crap and looking all sad. The movie isn't scary at all. About thirty minutes into the movie I was thinking \\"Wow this is one of the dumbest movies i've seen in a while!\\" It's not even one of those movies thats so unbelievably stupid that its funny.

I had heard that Ring 2 was scarier than the first. Other than one or two jump scenes where Samara appears out of nowhere, there is very little to make this movie worth watching.To me, this movie can't decide if it wants to be a horror movie, a mystery or something else. I don't understand the purpose of the scene with the homicidal deer, other than it makes for an interesting special effect. Before, Samara always came through the TV. Now, she can appear out of nowhere for no particular reason. She can also can use mind control to get people to commit suicide.The end of the movie makes little sense. Naomi Watts goes Samara's world, and when she gets there she changes her mind? And she gets out how? Her method of escape makes little sense.

The critics never get what people like, and the \\"hard core horror fans\\" never get what people like in a basic scare film.The setting in Astoria is a beautiful backdrop, and yes the credits do say that the backdrops were shot there in a beautiful city.One of the elements of the first film is taken out and focused on... Samara's needs.Also, to see the mythos behind the birth of Samara, and the state of the birth mother of Samara is very intriguing.All in all, this adds up to a good watch.I can't wait for the DVD release, and hopefully they will add some maybe scarier moments, of which I definitely hope there are some.

Ring 2 just flat out fails to deliever the goose-bump-anxiety provoking-cerebral-creepy kind of horror that I loved about the original. Part of this is due to the fact that anyone who saw Ring 1 kind of now knows the basic premise of the Ring and by default- it's not so scary. Also, the producers resort to more of a campy reliance on modern, over the top special effects that fail to carry the movie. Ring 1, like Blair Witch Project and much of Hitchcock's work hit a horror home run by scaring you with anticipation, confusion and what you DON'T see, not so much by showing you the gory details. Rent it if you must satifsy your curiousity about what happens in Ring 2 but it's definitley not worth adding to your library."},{"rating":"1","title":"thank goodness I rented it...","review":"That way I am only out $3.99. This sequel had nothing to it, you knew what would happen before it happened. No scary moments, and what was up with the deer? Even my 12yo daughter thought it was a lame movie. Save your money, watch The Ring 1, much better and stop there."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUCKED!!!!","review":"Man. this sequel to ring, SUCKED BIG TIME...was more Drama then scary and suspense, Real stupid, waste my money bought THIS CRAP! The first one was great and scary. HOPE they not going to do the same with \\"GRUDGE two\\" making it like this lame! Cross my finger i guess! Skip this Sequel, is B.S, and wasting money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ring 2","review":"Part of the reason I felt this and the first one worked well was the believability factor that Naomi Watts gave. Her performance as Aidan's Mom was great. The movie had a few scares for me and I felt that I got my moneys worth by seeing it at the theaters. If you loved the first one, this is a must see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very subpar sequel","review":"Let me start by saying I did enjoy the first ring, but this one is terrible. The story was completed in the first one. This movie has nothing to add to the first one. The movie is very slow, has a bad story, and is not creepy at all. About 90 minutes of the movie is devoted to \\"Plot Developement\\" and about 15 minutes is \\"Scares.\\" I did not jump once nor was I ever creeped out. It's sad when the best part of a movie is where people get attacked by cg deer. I saw this movie at a screening with about 12-15 people and no one liked it. The movie does have my favorite line in recent memory \\"She was murdered and left to die.\\" Now that's some quality writing. I would encourage anyone to miss this movie and go watch \\"Constantine\\" or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't stop the dang car!!!","review":"This woman seemed like she was trying to kill her kid from the very beginning of the movie. Not only did she send him off to be alone with the creepy ghost girl time and time again, but she'd let him go off by himself at a carnival or whatever where he could have easily been kidnapped. This woman is a horrible mother! And in the dumbest scene in horror movie history, a pack of killer Bambie are attacking the car with the mother and son inside. The son keeps yelling at her not to stop the car but she doesn't seem to get the message. She stops the car over and over again and just lets Bambie slam his horns through his window! What the heck???This movie never should have been made. It's way worse than the first and actually less scary if that's at all possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"compared to the Japanese original...","review":"Completely off - story changed since in the real movie the mother dies halfway through. This isn't a remake - it's just a made-up \\"sequel\\" for Americans that aren't intelligent enough to rent the subtitled originals. Not that this is surprising since Ringu was a great movie and the American version was an empty special effect filled attempt. I suggest instead The Grudge which change little. I hope the prequel is remade here: where we see who Sadako really is: a victim. Only because in America she is seen as a monster. I hope the tyin movie \\"Spiral\\" in left alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shrooms? A must have!","review":"The only way this movie is any good is if youre on shrooms or too bored or comatose to care about anything.. I was watching The Ring 2... and halfway through.. im thinking i accidentally put in Lord Of The Rings.. i mean.. this piece of crap NEVER ENDS.. but Lord of the Rings is good.. and this sucks..The ending is retarded.. the deer are fake as hell looking.. and the only cool part is the water effect in the bathroom.. THAT IS IT.. WARNING: DO NOT BUY THIS UNLESS YOU HAVE A RANDOM ASSORTMENT OF DRUGS AND OR A GUN.. CUZ BEFORE ITS OVER.. ULL WANT PUT OUT OF UR MISERY.."},{"rating":"1","title":"That sure was a waste of time.","review":"Whoa, now this is a real stinker. The original was dumb but the sequel is dumber. There are so many things wrong with this movie I can't being to count them. Don't waste your time, watch something, anything else. Halloween, Carrie, the original Haunting all blow this movie away. Even Ghostbusters is scarier. This one is just plain and simple stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beats the pants off Boogeyman, White Noise, & Darkness.","review":"Naomi Watts is the best thing about this film. The soundtrack contributed well to the mood of the film. The premise is somewhat flimsy; would've been better served to stick with more aspects of the original. The opening sequence for Ring 2 is worthwhile; Simon Baker really had no purpose in the film. Have to give the filmmakers credit for not going for slasher thrills; however, this film didn't scare me. (neither did the original). Hopefully this film will help further Naomi Watts' career. Heck, if you've seen the first, you gotta see the sequel. Do it for Naomi."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I don't like to give bad reviews to popular sequels, but when I went to the theaters to see this movie, I was expecting a real treat. Kind of an upgrade scare. Not here, sorry but this sequel flops. I don't want to say much, only that it's not what you're expecting. Rent, do not buy this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shouldn't have made this sequel","review":"I did like the first Ring because it was something a bit different.This one was a pure yawner. Wasn't really scary. Story was slow and didn't make much sense. So Sam takes over his body during one of Hadyen dreams. So she must drown here son in the bathtub to rid her spirtit from his body. Makes sense? Not to me.I have had scary experiences while playing Fatal Frame on my PS2 than this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh","review":"So I absolutely loved the first Ring and still think of it as the only movie to ever really creep me out unlike any before. So, I was really wary of seeing this in the theater seeing that I was terrified of the first Ring. But, since I love Horror film, I decided why not? Well, to begin with, The Ring 2 is not scary, or real creepy or disturbing. Its really sort of unnecessary. The foreboding mood of the first film has dissapeared. Even the creepy little girl in the well isn't as, well, creepy as the first time around. The actual plot of the film is somewhat dumb, for lack of a better word. Its incoherent and boring and unsurprising. So, what I recommend is, watch the first and be prepared for a thrill, and don't bother with this one. Its a waste really. I still chide myself for being so worked up over it, before I even watched it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really liked this movie!","review":"I saw this movie in theaters and LOVED it. I thought it was almost creepier than the first movie! I got it here on Amazon for only $.01 and I have to admit I couldn't be happier! Alot of people didn't like this one for whatever reason, but I loved it. If you are a huge horror movie fan like I am, I say get this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THINGS THAT ARE FRESH GO STALE QUICKLY!","review":"I thought the \\"The Ring\\" was pretty good and a fresh idea for the horror genre. The \\"The Ring 2\\" however, is just OK. We've seen it all before now and it just doesn't do it for me the second time around. It isn't a really bad movie is just isn't really good either. The DVD still looks great, so if your a fan............"},{"rating":"2","title":"Its The Ring ....","review":"This second installment of The Ring is alot more scarier than the first one. There were quite alot of moments where I was covering my eyes, hiding from the terror.And the special effects are alot better than the first one. I was amazed at just how great some of the effects looked.Naomi Watts is outstanding as the tough mother trying to save her son from the evil ghost of the girl who died in the well.Sissy Spacek gives a great performance as the mother locked in a mental institution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not scary at all","review":"trust me, this movie is BORING. this was a major disappointment compared to the original; it just plain old wasn't scary. Figures that the 5-star reviews came from 2 14-year olds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent! Excellent! Excellent!","review":"This book is an excellent read for any woman, especially to women of color.

And STILL we RISE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT","review":"This is a very inspiring book in regards to answering our call to leadership in all areas of life. Not only does it direct the leadership journey, it provides Christian guideposts. It challenges your own personal ambitions and goals. It is an excellent read for women. Rise Up!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This book is such a treasure. It isn't full of feel-good, self-stroking affirmation nonsense, it's full of real stories about people who beat the odds, overcame their fears, and dared their dreams. I promise you'll need a hankie for some of the stories you'll read here.The author's self-promotion & ambitions for further \\"Unstoppable\\" stories geared towards teens, moms, oldsters, etc, is a little off-putting. While there's nothing wrong with tooting your own horn, there are more subtle ways to do it. I hope her other books in the forthcoming \\"Unstoppable\\" series are as uplifting as the first, but I envision a downward spiral of sentimental claptrap, such as were spawned by the original \\"Chicken Soup\\" book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Motivational High Fi","review":"Amazing Motivational stories - Cynthia's Unstoppable changes the course of life. Cynthia Kersey writes that a prominent psychologist asked 3,000 people, \\"What have you to live for?\\" An amazing 94% answered by saying they had no purpose for their lives. Now when there isn't any central purpose, one easily can fall prey to fear, worries, trouble and self pity! Dark shadows hover over our lives. Her stories are inspiring, true and reminds of Pastor Bayless Conley's speech on Zee. The book is unstoppable reading and too motivational that makes one explore potentials within to go along life's way in a very practical manner without a stop. A good pick."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"REVITALIZATION\\" of the \\"PASSION WITHIN\\"","review":"I've always been a person who believed that we are each born with a personal, God given calling.

I speak so often to others of getting \\"out of the rut\\" and find myself stuck in the same place.UNSTOPPABLE was just the book that I was looking for to pull me out of my rut and get back on track doing what God has planned for my life.Thank you Cynthia for developing your gift and sharing it that others might grow too."},{"rating":"2","title":"My jaw dropped open!","review":"The stories in Unstoppable are awe inspiring. It's hard to believe that the stories behind the scenes are often filled with impossible odds, unlikely heroes and unbelievable faith. You often think that famous and successful people are just different from you or I but they're not. They are just unstoppable! I hate failure but Unstoppable shows you that failure is on the road to success! I love this book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was a GREAT read. A must for all acheivers.","review":"This book puts life in perspective. Reading about people who are not extraordinary by birth or bloodlines, but in their belief system, makes anything seem possible. This should be a must read for 8th graders and up. Our youth need to read about people who have overcome much to get where they are. People they can recognize or relate to. This book gives everyone inspiration to forge ahead and never, never quit on a dream."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another goal setting book","review":"I was really looking forward to getting this book but was disappointed to see that it was only another goal setting book. It was nice to read the success stories but that didn't make enough difference to make the book any more helpful than any other I've read. If you've never read anything about goal setting, this would be a great book. But if you have, don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inspiring","review":"Unstoppable is truly a marvelous read!! I picked up the book while on vacation and found I could not put it down.The stories are inspiring; it shows how anyone can achieve success if they choose too. Each of the 7 Characteristics have supporting stories, plus the personal action plans to help ones focus. And the quotes at the end of every story by the person in story are very up lifting.This is a book I have and will continue to recommend. It can help you focus, be inspired and renew your spirit. You will realize you can achieve if you believe in yourself!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The right kind of inspiration.","review":"This is not just another collection of true stories because the KIND of stories collected here make all the difference. These are not just stories of people making a million dollars by making a cheaper product and beating the competition. These are the kind of stories that encourage people to succeed by doing good works in the world. They are the kind of stories you will want to read to your children. If you have a goal that is difficult but you feel really needs to be done, this is the book for you. I'm the author of the book, Self-Help Stuff That Works, and I know what works. This book will inspire you to action."},{"rating":"2","title":"One small story can change an entire life.","review":"One particular story in this book is one that everybody should read. I loved the powerful prose and disturbingly familiar motivational phrases - they helped me get out of bed in the morning. The lesson we can learn from Bill Porter: triumphs don't need to be big to be large. It's like swimming with sharks: you can be wet, but you don't have to die, too. Other stories in this book struck a chord with me, but Bill Porter's love for life will always ring true in my heart of hearts, my gut of guts..he is LOVE. I thoroughly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Motivating!","review":"This book is very inspiring and motivating.

It has horrible voice talents, the animation is bad, and it has a broken up story line that has no point to it. If you want to have an enjoyable movie for your children, get An American Tail, or something else NOT THIS! I'd give this 0 stars if I could. If you get it, you will have wasted your money, Believe me, my 5 year old brother thought it was bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"For my Daughter's College Graduation","review":"I just love the Blue Mountain Arts Collection. Such meaning in each book. I have given my daughter a different Blue Mountain book each year of her college years. It will be something she will cherish and hopefully pass on to her children. This particular book I am planning to give to her as a gift upon her graduation from college this spring. She plans to teach high school math. Every book I have purchased has made me cry, knowing it is what I would like to say, but can't find the words."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining yarn","review":"The third installation of the Lewrie series was very entertaining. I thought number two was a little boring, but this book was back in stride with the first book. Lewrie is a likable devil. Full of lust and deceit, but good at heart. I find that Lambdin's subplots of Lewrie ashore, usually involving women, to be very entertaining. It gives the stories variety, and gives insight into the time period of the stories. He does a masterful job of creating dramatic plotlines that are intriguing and entertaining.Lambdin's description of life at sea is also excellent. He captures the unique lifestyle, and Lewrie's character melds in well in this setting. I look forward to the fourth story."},{"rating":"2","title":"D Lambdin","review":"I ran across this book somewhat by chance. Having read Horatio, J. Aubrey and Richard B., I thought it was worth exploring. I found it a good read with a bit more humor in it than the other book series previously mentioned. It does seem to delve a bit more into sexual encounters which may or may not be a negative for some readers. Since this is the first in the series I will have to see if the sexual encounters prevades future books in the series. Alan Lewrie, the main character, seems to be a believable and enjoyable character. I am looking forward to the next in the series to see how it continues. Alan sure starts out with a lot of obstacales which he will have to overcome if he is to have a career in the Kings/Queens Navy. Based on the number of books in the series so far he surely must overcome some of them. We will have to see?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"Good light reading.

It gives a historical perspective of hermeneutics and provides a comprehensive critical hermeneutic framework for thinking about organizational, socioeconomic and cultural agendas that enables adults to work together and assess their actions. Not a book that assumes a neutral stance, it moves beyond mainstream epistemological models of development. This book contributes to philosophy, anthropology, organizational development and adult learning and includes specific ways to design inquiry and action programs that make a difference to leaders and researchers in the worlds of education, NGO's, business, government and international development."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE FEW MOST COMPELLING MEMOIRS EVER WRITTEN.","review":"First of all, I would like to tell everyone that, with the amazing consistency of this confessional work, this is a book worth your time. No matter who you are or whatever, this book is a universal piece of literature for the boy in this book and his nature is a reflection of the typical childhood. Simply amazing and very well written; I say very well written for each and every word in this book is undoubtedly real and from the core of truthfulness of the boy's (Jack's) points of view towards everything that happened to him. Read it and have fun doing so (I assure you an inevitable enjoyment)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough and Real","review":"Rather than reproduce the entire book in this review, I just want to say, briefly, that it's not easy to feel a lot of sympathy for Toby Wolff as a boy because he sabotages your empathy with his crazy behavior. But he's a real person. You feel his emotions, his predicaments, and his frustrations. That's because the writing here is so clear and direct. And as a result, you carry on, sadly knowing how trapped he is in his childhood, his powerlessness. I'm glad I read this book, but I'm not sure why. I think it's because it validates our spirit of survival, and verifies the utter stupidity of some parents toward their children. I recommend it to anyone who has had rough sailing while growing up, which is probably the entire human race."},{"rating":"2","title":"This boy's life!?!?!?! - or is it!","review":"This boys life portrays the life of an everage boy American during the 1950's.

One, it was a assigned reading book and most of the books schools assign are boring and dumb, this year being no exception. Actually, they assigned us two good books, After Long Silence & Ender's Game. Other than those, the rest sucked. A Boy's Life wasnt that good either. Why, being in 2001, would ninth graders want to read about a boy in a dysfunctional family back in 1950's? That is a question that I want answered. Boys might find this book appealing but I, as a female, do not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Endlessly going nowhere","review":"I wish I had put this book down when I began to realize that it was going nowhere.

So be it.I've seen This Boy's Life in the Pattaya, Thailand library at least a dozen times. Today I was desperate enough to take it out and read as far as page 84. I liked the book well enough at first, but it's one of those like Angela's Ashes, in which the boy's life goes from bad to worse -- and then gets worser. Yuck! Bleah!After several misadventures with his mother's boyfriends and his own lousy friends, the boy, Tobias, who wants to be known as Jack, goes along with the idea of living in a hideous town with a hideous potential stepfather, because it seems like a good idea. Whaaaaaat? He already despises the man.I can't read any farther. Actually, I did skip ahead and found that things keep getting worse for the kid. Maybe I'll look at the last few pages just to see how miserable his life turns out to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Boy's Life","review":"I think This Boy's Life writtern by Tobias Wolff was extremly dissapointing and uneventful.

Making friends with one of the losers of the school he eventually ends up fighting him in the smoker, the school boxing club. The issues of depression and misery were unappealing and reading it every night was like a chore rather than a plesure.This book is not suitable for School children as they would not find the book interesting and will probally fail and post tests on the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real story about a real boy","review":"This is a wonderfully written story about the life of a boy.

It's doubtful he got all his stories correct. No matter. Wolff tells great stories, provides brash and honest insight into uncontrolled human nature, and is a wonder with word and phrase.He's a liar and a thief. His faults are everyone else's faults. Speaking of Arthur, a nemesis, he could be speaking of himself - \\"He talked himself into reveries where every word rang with truth.\\"And yet, in the end, we know that his escapades caught up with him.

There are not a lot of books that appeal to them. I appreciated the writing style very much - his prose is complex and haunting. I think that what the work is lacking is a series of DRAMATIC events. When someone reads a work, they want these huge things to happen. Wolff nicely illuminates how it's the frequent \\"little\\" things that lead to our real problems. I understood this completely while I was reading it and I felt the narrative was understaed in a dark and interesting way. However, because the plot lacks these big events, I don't know if my high school aged boys will fully embrace it the same way they embrace \\"The Basketball Diaries\\", for example. That being said, this is better written than \\"The Basketball Diaries\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Timeless Memoir","review":"\\"This Boy's Life\\" focuses on the pre-college years of a young man, Toby, from a broken, yet interesting, family. All but abandoned by his father, Toby and his semi-heroic mother cross the country searching for a better life. Her tragic penchant for hooking up with seriously flawed men, who act Toby's surrogate fathers, makes the book unpredictable and humorous. By his own admission, the author, who readily acknowledges his own flaws, is testimony to the fact that with a strong spirit and a little luck, one can rise above his circumstances and ultimately make something of himself. Generally, I am a fan of the memoir genre and this is a good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tobias Wolff's Memoir","review":"I read Tobias Wolff's novel Old School and thought it was just okay, but his memoir was really great. He recounts his childhood from Florida to a small town in Washington State. His narratives are extremely interesting, from forging checks, planning to run away to Alaska, and stealing cars.

At 10 and 11 yrs old ('64,'65) we here too busy exploring creeks...., playing ball, constructing forts out of what was at hand, walking the railroad tacks, climbing trees....

He is both practical (as an analyst with an eclectic range of paradigms) and as an author who offers powerful stories that help the reader to make sense of the complexity of his psychotherapeutic practice. The stories offer insights into the worlds of his (often temporarily unhealthy) patients, but for me, the useful theorising emerges from his symbolism - the development of the two triangles. The Triangle of Conflict, with its three vertices representing Defence, Anxiety and Hidden Feelings: and the Triangle of Person, where the vertices represent Other 'O'(recent past), Transference, 'T' (here-and-now) and Parent 'P' (distant past).

I don't like the angle that the cord comes out of the handle either (comes out at a 90 degree angle to the handle)- it seems to get in the way more than when the cord comes out straight from the handle. Maybe it is that way because the drill can be put in a smaller packing box - who knows. Truth be told - I bought this because my brother gasve me a $50.00 gift certificate for Christmas, I needed a 3/8\\" drill (already have a 1/2\\" drill and it is too big for some jobs) and this came in right under $50.00."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product Never Arrived--So How Can I Review It?","review":"This is one of the rare times when Amazon totally let me down.

I didn't do my homework and it's my fault and I guess your opinion of this will depend on what you're using it for.The lenses are alright and the magnification is okay. but they're *so* small. I wish I bought anything else but this. A few years ago I bought a couple of cheap radioshack magnifiers. They were similar to this. The lenses weren't quite as good, but they are *much* bigger. Since then, they've taken some damage and I was looking to replace them. This was not the way to do it! I'm so disappointed! If wasn't for me not paying enough attention when I read the specs on this item I'd give it a 1 star. I'm thinking about re-selling it because I'll likely never use this.

And could it ever be possible for the moon to find a way to dance with Bear?Bear has a very sweet spirit, and Little Bird is a helpful and supportive friend.

A good author can make them work, and Jude did. Besides, the book is situated in a little more modern way with two such young heroes. I agree very much with the others in that Holly and Nick were fleshed out pretty well and were more like the good ole Jude Deveraux quality we're used to. However, the plot was very loose and rushed, with many questions left hanging. The other characters in the book were also VERY one dimensional and didn't seem to have appropriate motivation for the things they did. The book started well and appeared to become more rushed as it was written. I wish I hadn't bought it. I keep hoping her books will go back to normal, but it's been very hit or miss lately. Re-read the old ones for some VERY good writing!Also, it's very much NOT a Christmas story. Christmas has very little to do with the book or plot. Don't be fooled.

I loved them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Romance","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer that I was duped into buying something that wasn't what I expected. But this was the first Jude Deveraux book I had read and am now hooked.Jude Deveraux has a way of pulling you into the story so that you just can't put the book down. The next book I read was Wild Orchids. Again another unconventional romance, and again I loved it.

And when you have money life it seems is so much fun. Sex, Sex, and more Sex, It was fun. A little corny in some places but a good summer read.

A christmas story??? Christmas was in it for about 4 pages. My theory on this... Jude Devereaux (one of my FAVORITE authors) wrote an outline for a story. A pretty good one, acutally. Her publisher called and said \\"I have to have a Christmas story\\". Put in some gratuitous sex, have something happen on Christmas, and send it in. Sorry, but I don't want to read about some rich gal who wants to marry a man she \\"loves\\", but jumps into bed with someone else the moment she meets him, and every two pages thereafter. All the while crying how much she wants to marry the other guy. Oh PLEASE. The interesting parts of this story are totally glossed over.

However, if Holly is the new standard, I won't be bothering in the future.Several major plot points are glossed over in a paragraph or two, such as Lorrie's actions, which are completely out there, and poorly explained. Character development is adequate for Holly and Nick, but the others are cardboard. And frankly, I thought the sex scenes were awkward. They were more explicit than her usual work and I don't get the feeling that she's comfortable writing that way.In a nutshell, I was disappointed and I think I'll stick with re-reading A Knight in Shining Armor and some of her earlier work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow to get into it but hard to put down","review":"I thought this book was quite lovely.

I like Jude Deveraux's books because she is able to create a romance unlike any other. Sure a frisky novel is great and this book is frisky at times but personaly I like for there to be more to it then that.

I don't use shaving cream, but I get a great shave with the Venus Embrace without shaving cream, and in a lot less time. The Schick Quattro razor is very non-irritating and I never cut myself, and it does seem slightly better than the Venus Embrace on underarms in terms of irritation and getting stray hairs, but that does not make up for the dismal job it does on my legs.

It seems like she is always about to release the cd that will put her in the catagory of divas like Mariah Carey or Erykah Badu, in my opinion it sadly hasn't happened.

This one fits the bill, perfectly. We've had ours for over a year, & so far, we've connected it to a laptop, DVD, & VCR. We even connected it to a TV, so we could use it to watch the Superbowl. It's handled everything we've thrown at it. I can't vouch for the sound, because we connect the equipment through our sound system, but it does have speakers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent anti-anxiety medicine","review":"Takes only a short while to build up in your system. I order this for my Mom and it really does the job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Size of boxes","review":"This is my gripe about most sudoku books the size of the boxes makes it difficult to put readable notes in boxes. How can one judge the quality of the puzzle when the error is due to an unreadable note?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusually Challenging... I hope you have time on your hands.","review":"This Sudoku book is unique in that the publisher boasts that all 300 puzzles are created by an actual person. There is an introduction that, in addition to giving the rules and strategy hints, explains why these \\"handmade\\" puzzles are unique and supposedly more interesting to solve. I think it just makes them harder! Typically a computer generated \\"easy\\" takes me five minutes or so, these \\"easy\\" puzzles *really* stumped me. As in it over an hour to solve the first one. Its a good sized book, small enough to carry around but large enough to pencil in guesses. Nice heavy paper stands up to the inevitable erasing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clearly the Best and a lot of Fun","review":"The Nikoli Sudoku books are simply the best. The easy ones are easy, and the difficult ones are much harder. You can pick what suits your mood. As a previous reviewer said, sometimes it seems that the easy are not clearly easier. As I considered it, I think it has some to do with the puzzle solving techniques one uses. If you are working on the harder puzzles, you use a different set of techniques. When you get to the easier ones, you have to shift gears and use a different set.And as the cover text says, these puzzles may be difficult, but not frustrating.With lot of other Sudoku puzzles, it is hard to tell the difference between the easy and the hard, and none are too challenging.These are head and shoulders above the other Sudoku books I have used--from easy to difficult--and a lot of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheesehead","review":"This is the first M.C.

I am looking forward to reading the next Agatha Raisin mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quiche of Death","review":"While this is my first Agatha Raisin Mystery, I was expcecting more development of the story. It has been a very slow start even with a murder thrown in. It reads a bit scattered. I will try another of her books and not be thrown off by my first read. I do enjoy a well written mystery; however, I enjoy it when it encourages me to turn quickly to the next page to find out a new bit of information so I might believe I have solved the puzzle before the end of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful English Novel","review":"I love English/Scottish character novels.. so I fell in love with this one. It was light , but fun reading . The main character was over the top at times, and there were gaps in relationships and time, but all in all, I enjoyed it .I miss the Rosamind Pilcher novels . This was not as good , or as long, but, a nice read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raisin rides again","review":"This Agatha is quite amusing with her coterie of friends (and enemies) but I was surprised by several type/homonyms in the e-book. This makes me want to read more of her adventures!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I've never read an Agatha Raisin book before, and now I know why. She is not a very likable character and the book is boring. I'm halfway through and nothing has happened. I can't bring myself to finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good relaxing read.","review":"This is a good way to spend an evening reading about the differences in life. Not all will find the story to be riveting, and not be able to lay it down, but it has a good story line and catches you up in the mystery. Good choice from the Amazon collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Calamity goes to the Cotswolds","review":"Crawl into the cozy of the Cotswalds with Agatha Raisin, who makes her debut as unorthodox heroine to the menopausal set. Taking a well earned early retirement to the village of Carsley, Agatha tries to adapt her presumptuous and pushy personality to the cozy and contentious community life. Aggressive Agatha is clueless in the deportment department, but determined to fit into her imagined idyllic retirement at any cost. And never imagines that the store bought quiche she enters into the village cooking contest will kill someone. Agatha's allure lies in her complete lack of tact and charm, her assertive aplomb, shrewd intellect, rude responses, and the little glimpses the reader is permitted of the human Agatha. The scenery is splendidly sketched, the cast of characters outrageous but somehow believable, and this middle aged mama's only complaint is that this book ends all too quickly - but hold on - this is a series, and more Agatha awaits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paint by numbers","review":"I love a good cozy, especially British ones, so I was looking forward to this book. What a disappointment! I do not mind a prickly protagonist, but I am bothered by poor writing. It reads more like an overly long synopsis rather than an actual story. Everything is told, little is shown. Characters are (at best) caricatures or stereotypes. There are a number of possible suspects, but Beaton plumps for the obvious. The denouement is anti-climatic.I won't bother with the rest of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh, not great","review":"I haven't even finished the book because its a bit boring. The characters never really developed into anything interesting and the storyline isn't a page-turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"The comic joy of Agatha","review":"I loved this book with its quirky humour, its deluded heroine and colourful characters, as well as its Cotswold setting. The writer has a wonderfully comic style, that means the reader does not take any of the characters seriously, but the cosy humorous depiction of Agatha and her ambitions provides the ideal read for a night by the fire or in bed just before turning the light off. I will definitely be reading more of the Agatha Raisins mysteries anytime I want some light relief."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ms. Raisin - funny, witty & fresh","review":"I gotta confess that I was turned onto this book series only after I was looking for something of the sort after devouring all through the Goldy Bear series of Diane Mott Davidson. However, this quiche was all it took for me to become absolutely hooked. I've long since found all the rest of the books in the series and read them. I love them! Agatha Raisin is a very well developed character. She's laugh-out-loud funny, sarcastic, and in her very own grouchy way, quite endearing. The book's storyline develops along seamlessly and in a very interesting manner. I'd read that the British cozy movement had a great friend in M.C. Beaton. I definitely agree and recommend this book wholeheartedly to every mystery junkie and just about anyone with the itch to get their hands on a good book...or a good way not to mess up a quiche contest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever writing and a great character combine for a good read","review":"I've just discovered the novels of M.C. Beaton through the Hammish Macbeth TV series running on BBC America. While the majority seem to prefer the Macbeth series, I don't. Agatha Raisin is a prickly personality that is delightful to read because she says the things we would want to say and don't. This particular book is a great character study and even if set in England, I recognize my own small hometown within its pages. Is it literature? No, thank God! But it is a pleasant weekend read. Oh, and if you've ever read the very funny Regency romances of Marion Chesney, you'll want to know she is also M.C. Beaton."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something to consider...","review":"The key to being able to enjoy (or attempt to enjoy) this fairly quick read will be your ability to stomach the main character, Agatha Raisin. Agatha is an arrogant, self-centered, manipulative b**ch -- with a few relapses into decent behavior. By the end, her character arc leads to a kinder softer Agatha. However, in the second book, she defaults back to her acerbic manner. On the plus side, this book helped me realize that an important ingredient to a mystery I will enjoy is a likable protagonist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best one of the lot","review":"I read several in this series and was somewhat disappointed because of the tawdry behavior of the heroine. In comparison, this very first one has been a real pleasure to read. It has some genuinely funny places and Agatha comes across as endearing and someone you would really enjoy getting to know. She is a modern Miss Marple. Just what I had been hoping for in this series but had not gotten until now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grumpy Agatha grows on you","review":"Cheaters never win and, in this case, they may also be suspected of murder. Agatha Raisin retires to quiet country life in curmudgeonly fashion and realizes that she needs to make friends. Making friends and cooking are both skills she lacks. Nonetheless, Agatha enters a cooking competition and someone dies from her Quiche. Secrets, affairs and kittens keep the reader intrigued not so much the who but the how is quite twisty. Read and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quiche of Death recommended","review":"I love both of MC Beaton's series in the UK and each book just gets better! Agatha Raisin is fun and funny to be with."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LIKE IT!","review":"I enjoyed this book as much as all the previous Agatha books I have read. It was a very entertaining and easy read. Even though some elements are predictable (Agatha fixating on a man) it doesn't detract from the fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Caroline0731","review":"I truly enjoyed this book. It held you to the end to find out what happened but wasn't \\"horror\\" scary. A great way to spend a rainy day."},{"rating":"1","title":"death of quiche reading","review":"I guess I am not into England country site and names. The plot was interesting but I kept being put off by the various visits to English towns. The second story that came with this purchase was a little better and almost made me want to find out what happen to Agatha between to two stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Agatha Raisin and the Quiche of Death","review":"I loved this book I have just started to read her books so I have started out of order but they stand alone anyway. I have since read two more and enjoyed them as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Cover","review":"As a student focusing on Islam, I expected this book to address the conflict between Islamic fundamentalism and democracy throughout the book; after all, the title states, \\"Terrorism's Challenge to Democracy.\\" In truth, Barber includes only one chapter on Islam. Additionally, he uses the word \\"jihad\\" as a blanket term to describe all world-wide struggles to maintain traditional culture in the face of the overwhelming American capitalist machine. He uses this term to make a point, but he also succeeds in confusing readers as to what it actually means and stands for. No, jihad does not necessarily mean rebellion against capitalism, nor does Islam advocate such a thing. In the end, uninformed readers might come away with incorrect ideas about Islam, seeing as it's barely addressed in the entire book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better written","review":"The title of this book and the cover photograph are definitely catchy. The book broadly argues that we live in a world in which western consumer culture is rapidly expanding and in some ways, encroaching, on other cultures around the planet and as a result there is an attempt to push back. If you are interested in east-west relations, there is some information in this book that is certainly useful but unfortunately that information is obscured by the verbose writing style of the author. After gleaning the main point of this book, I gave up reading it half-way through because the prose was so convoluted."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is important!","review":"An important book, indeed. Barber reveals much of what is lost on most people with regards to the globalisation phenomonen. Far more realistic than Huntington, and if one also reads Hans-Peter Martin's \\"Global Trap\\", the chaos all around us seems a little clearer, if not making complete sense. Written in an unpretentious, accessible style, with detailed footnoting and refrences, this book should be compulsaray reading for those who feel a little confused about the way we're all heading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly simplistic..","review":"Barber's analysis ignores important facts in order to prove his thesis about how the primary battle in the world being between the free market and religious fundamentalism. It works, somewhat, but fails to take into account numerous instances where this tension is called into question. Not every zealot in the world is an enemy of technology, as the War in Iraq has shown us."},{"rating":"2","title":"An illuminating experience!","review":"This book is a must for anyone interested in marketing or in how marketing is used to manipulate the choices we make. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who still believes in the myth that democracies are a natural output of capitalism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross.","review":"I am reading this book as part of a Western Civ class. Actually, last semester, my professor was raving about how interesting this book was, and his description of it intrigued me enough to take the second semester of his course, in which he would assign us the book. I took the class, and over the past two weeks I've been reading the book, I'm almost done. This is one of the most boring books I've ever read. Same idea over and over again: Corporate America is greedy. 300 pages that could be summed up in twenty. However there are some passages that are fairly interesting toward the end, so it gets 2 stars. Don't waste your money though."},{"rating":"1","title":"McWorld? More like McMoron","review":"This work is hardly groundbreaking theory. Even for 1995. The fact that Barber can argue that McWorld (basically capitalism) is detrimental to democracy is ridiculous. Also, Jihad hates McWorld, not because of its global market economy but because of who we are. Jihad hates America because we are a \\"Christian\\" nation. Read the Qur'an."},{"rating":"1","title":"A point please!","review":"Barber's got an interesting topic here, but he doesn't seem to go anywhere with it. He doesn't give any statistics, facts, or anecdotes to explore the yin and yang of globalism and the Third World. Instead he seems to go on and on without adding to the subject. The preface to the post-9/11 printing is interesting, but the rest of the book is somewhat dated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writes like an associate professor who's up for tenure","review":"I found this guy's writing style exceptionally annoying. He seems to have made a conscious effort to choose the most abstruse, pompous phrasing possible, even when describing the simplest of concepts. This book reads a bit like something Frasier and Niles Crane would write: full of themselves, striving at every opportunity to sound erudite while coming acros to many as pompous, arrogant, and somewhat out of touch.Some of his analyses are also a bit of a stretch. In many cases, he'll use some obscure reference to, say, Milton or Keats or explain the motivations of a Palestinian suicide bomber or a Balkan nationalist. This to me seems rather silly. Whatever the motivations of a Palestinian suicide bomber, they're more likely to be explained by such concepts as religous fanaticism, economic desperation, and political alienation than by some eggheaded reference to Paradise Lost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but incomplete.","review":"I would echo the praise for this book here. I'd also say it's a little shortsighted technologically. Yes, the net could have negative social impacts, but I think it could be a major saving force for democracy, on a global level...I'd like to see Barber do some work on the posssiblity of democratization of democratic discourse itself, which possibility is only available in a heavily networked environment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author is big on \\"Democracy\\"","review":"The author does not seem to understand that America is suppposed to be a 'republic' not a 'democracy'.Democracy is rule by the mob (often an ignorant one)A republic is rule by law, where everyone's individual rights, are protected.Hopefully, one day, the author will review the excellent video at:[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately... a shrill, confused rant","review":"If you think this book will be something along the lines of Huntington's \\"Clash of Civilizations\\", think again. Barber makes scant mention of militant Islam or any other motivation for terror, and does little to discuss or propose practical remedies. Instead, he blathers on about \\"Declarations of Inter-dependence\\", \\"Global Justice\\", \\"Democracy versus Capitalism\\", world government, and every other warmed over pot of anti-globalizing porridge that you can imagine. Within the first twenty pages of the book he is morally equating terrorists with currency speculators, and that theme remains throughout. His hatred for freedom and his ignorance of basic economics are palpable, and both are well expressed in his frequent and verbose attacks on ridiculous straw men. The only Jihad on show here is Barber's zealous neo-Marxism."},{"rating":"2","title":"globalization","review":"interesting bookmade me think of our importing of ideas and cultural items into other socieities ina different lighti didnt agree with everything inthis book and i didnt know of all the references the author made(people) but it was written in a very intelligent manner"},{"rating":"1","title":"McGarbage","review":"To think a tree died for this book! What a waste and please don't waste your time. Barber's point, assuming he has one, is lost in his attemp to be flip and witty. He could have summed up his thesis in a paragraph but then he wouldn't have a book to sell. Two forwards and an afterword? He should change his name to McVerbose. If you can read buy another book and if you can't read you don't need this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh - slow sci-fi as soft as ear wax","review":"I read the first two books of this series, but couldn't take it by the third. Couldn't finish it. The first one starts off interesting with hard science concepts and ideas, then de-evolves into something meandering and pointless. The other books get progressively worse. Think Jane Austen in space - nothing happens, everybody is a moron, and the entire plot is driven by pointless emotions and hand-wringing.If you read the author's essay in \\"Star Wars on Trial\\" it is easy to see why this happens. She basically talks about starting out as a hard sci-fi writer, but then proudly describes her abandonment of that genre, deeming it inferior. The whole point why I got interested in the first book is that it had some interesting ideas grounded in reality - not because of the melodramatic whining it turned into."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be prepared to survive","review":"Nice book -- goes into very detailed aspects of planning, purchasing or making, storing an endless list of products necessary for self-sufficiency.

It contains all the info needed for your family survival. Best I've read yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly outdated!","review":"Look at the dates of the other reviews before just adding this to your cart. The book I received in 2011 was from 1998 and came bundled with a Y2K magazine full of articles about how we were all gonna die on Jan 1 2000 (a slight exaggeration and I did get a few laughs out of it, but it is indicative of the date of this book). Again, check the copyright date of the book you are ordering.Having said that, I will add that although there is an extensive resource section, most of the information is outdated. There are listings for companies that went out of business years ago, and website addresses that no longer exist (remember AOL's member pages?).Bottom line: this is a basic food preparation and storage guide, but nothing you cant readily find on the internet these days. A better disaster preparedness book is Dr. Arthur Bradley's \\"Handbook to Practical Disaster Preparedness for the Family\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Confused on the topic? Don't know where to start? Read it.","review":"In preparation for a \\"worst case\\" year 2000 problem, I was swamped in starting my family's food storage plan. I had no idea where to start. This book took me by the hand and provided everything I needed from answering the following: Working with a tight budget? What to store? How much for how long? How to cook? Nutritional content? How to Store? The worksheets were very, very helpful and I highly recomend this as the first purchase of any year 2000 problem preparations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prepare now","review":"A wide range of many things you may need to know during an emergency!

Their reputation for being ready for any emergency or natural disaster is well known - up to 2 years food supply for each family. I bought the 10th edition and was amazed at the resources including an exhaustive preparedness resource index. These are methods are grandparents and the pioneers knew well but today's generation is unfamiliar with. It is nice to see this heritage passed along. Thanks for an excellent resource. I would also like to recommend The Survivor's Guide to The Year 2000. It is to financial and investments what this book is to food preparation: all the essentials for the LDS family and everyone else who feels that \\"peace of mind follows preparedness.\\" There is security in knowing you are ready for anything. I heartily recommned both resouces to all. Thanks again."},{"rating":"1","title":"More food prep oriented than emergency","review":"This book has some useful information but it doesn't fit the bill as an emergency book because much of it includes things like recipes which you cook in an 350 degree oven - which you may not have in a true emergency. Also, there are a lot of charts that look good but really don't help that much. 9 pages on the use of honey seems a bit much too. Resource section lists lots of resources but closer examination shows that many aren't geared to individuals or only carry one item for emergency use."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book on basic living - especially for city slickers","review":"This is the only book you will need to become enlightened on \\"country living\\"! You will discover how much fun sprouting your own seeds can be, how to rotate and label storage, how to make sourdough, and many other things that have been lost with super-market living.

Now we have a serious international problem involving several countries including Iran, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, Syria and North Korea. I have published internationally on the history of weapons of mass destruction during the mid 90's. Not only has our Government allowed the previously mentioned countries to take the crucial steps for atomic and other WMD development, but the IAEA was a partner in these efforts.

Perhaps getting rid of Saddam was not such a good idea. He could have acted as a buffer against the growing threat from Iran.

How discouraging to read of President Clinton's lack of concern of the ever increasing threat to our Western civilization. His presidency rates down there with Jimmy Carter."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read, for Every American!","review":"This book is very informative and concerning. The author does a great job detailing and documenting all of his claims. It's a must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enough to think about","review":"While the book is sometimes a bit over the top, it is still fascinating and scary as well. One review tried to compare Iran with Iraq by mentioning WMD's. A simple, partisan comment. Everyone knows Iran is building weapons because THEY HAVE SAID SO. I wish there was more documentation for his 9/11 connection claims. It is distracting there aren't any that will allay nagging doubts. However, this subject of Iranian nuclear capability needs to be carefully watched. They do not need to use those weapons to threaten us. With them, and without a response from us, their influence will grow throughout the Arab world. Then all those who see only evil in US policies will have the real comparison that clear thinking people have always seen between radical Islam and Western style democracy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"This book is very important to read. The situation with Iran will come to a head in 2006. Don't be spouting partisan propaganda (both Right and Left), get a hold of the facts.It is very serious.

That is unacceptable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Detailed Analysis of Iran's growing threat","review":"Timmerman goes right through the history of Iran's growing threat - both the motivation and the nuclear program.

Now, the same people are pushing for a war with Iran, claiming yet again that that country's present leader is worse than Lucifer.

I had no idea what it was and eventually misplaced it. When I observed competitors putting them on at triathlons last year, I finally realized the advantage of using one. Since I had misplaced my freebie, I bought a FuelBelt. The elastic gel holders are a bonus, although I have never used them. You can position the FuelBelt wherever it (and the bib) will be least obtrusive when cycling and/or running. The biggest advantage is during events where you are removing or adding clothing layers, due to weather and body temperature changes.BTW: I did eventually find the freebie bib belt and found it was too small for me. I lost the FuelBelt that I purchased last year, so I purchased another. It should be in the gear bag of every bib wearing endurance athlete!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rethink this one...","review":"I've have a whole different (and negative) experience with this fuel belt for gels. I used it in the Boston Marathon and it was constantly rotating around on me so that my number was riding on my hips. I also ended up using a safety pin as before the race even started, one of the elastic cords on the belt (that hold the race #) caught on my jacket zipper and tore out the perforated whole that the cord has to go through. Then during the race one of my Honey Stinger gels dropped out of a loop and onto the ground--this also happened in an earlier half-marathon where I stopped to pick it up--but no way in Boston (I would have caused a wreck on the congested course) so I came up short a gel. In examining the belt I found that the stitching on one of the loops has torn and several of the loops are stretched out. This product is good in concept, but poor in design and construction. Think twice before staking any important run on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the storage space.","review":"I thought this would help me on a recent triathlon, but when it arrived I was disappointed. The gel holders make it easy to rip your gels just trying to load them, and the squeeze-clips for the race number are very weak.

Why only 4 stars? I am not sure if this book will have \\"legs\\" beyond the landscape and history that it celebrates.

I wash the filter every 5-8k miles with K&N Filter cleaner and re-oil with K&N filter oil. It never comes quite as clean as you would like and it is starting to show some wear to the material and mesh cover.

They were re-done on this album for some reason and are not quite as good as the originals. While I admire Cowley's work, I would not say he was an innovative musical genius. Most of his music is a direct riff of Giorgio Moroder's \\"From Here to Eternity\\" (1977) and \\"E=MC2\\" (1979). However, it still does capture a certain period in club music of the early eighties and I still would recommend it.BTW, it does have 2 orginal Paul Parker songs \\"Right on Target\\" and Pushin' too hard\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Collection !","review":"A must for synth and Hi-NRG dance music lovers/likers.

I picked it up for my kids to use over the summer for something to do to and as a review. They are both middle school students. They found the math very confusing and the rest pretty easy.

But programmers who need to learn a new language, seem to think that it is quite OK. I would have to place myself in the first category. I read the first couple of chapters as part of a university course, but soon abandoned the book. The learning curve is way too steep for beginners. The progression of themes bears witness of limited pedagogical insight. But I still believe that folks with plenty of programming experience may enjoy this book. I give it two stars, though, primarily because of the inappropriate title. This is NOT a 'gentle' introduction to Java. Maybe the third edition has improved in this respect (published December 2000)?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!","review":"As a practicing professional programmer, I thought I couldn't have any problems with learning a new language...WRONG! This book is so error-laden as to be almost worthless. It does introduce topics in Java; however, it usually doesn't explain for 7 chapters what you just did nor why. Fine...I can accept that. However, the code, as written in the book, won't compile. Well, that can be a good thing...you have to learn how to fix code anyway, but you shouldn't have to do it right from the first program!!

My idea of a book is a useful and descriptive entity which covers a subject with sufficient depth to make it worthwhile reading. Not so for Java Gently.

Personally I would have enjoyed being entertained by the first upgrade while I waited for the larger expansion. Now they have delayed the release yet again. I'm sorry but this is not how you run a successful company. When you set a release date you had better make it even if this means overtime for the crew.

You ever charge 3 heavy calvary with 60 of your heavy calvary only to be beaten because the 3 heavy calvary you attacked just happened to have their daimyo? Come on, how stupid is that? There are a million bugs the game uses to get an advantage, which is a real shame, because the frustration it builds just does not make the game worth it.

One, it's got so much to do that you'll be playing for weeks before you really finish the game completely. The storyline is also quite interesting as you make and break alliances with neighbouring clans. The graphics in this game are quite impressive as are the sound affects. I like the over map idea because it shows the way real battles and wars are fought. The battles are truly the best battles I have seen in a game of this type. The true scale of war is highly impressive as thousands of soldiers engage each other in combat. The one gripe that I have about this game is the system requirements. You have to have a pretty good computer to be able to play the game without the slow down. But besides that, the game is truly one not to be missed.

Made in the early 80's and one of the first straight-to-video terror films that I can recall, the simple premise recalls many other \\"crazed killer in the woods\\" films that were reigning the box-office at this time. \\"Forest\\" makes many mistakes along the dreadful journey including the attempt to incorporate back-stories and some supernatural elements that the director clearly doesn't have the budget, actors, script, or flare to pull off. That isn't to say that \\"Forest\\" is unwatchable, but this is really for those compelled to see every 80's horror movie ever made...like me. I must tip my hat to the musicians involved, the tinny electronic music is quite amusing as is the pop-hit-that-never-was \\"The Forest\\" which is quite hilarious and truly must be heard to be believed.

The directions are clear, though some projects are split across pages. The pictures are all in color and illustrate the final products well. A few of the projects are done in thread, which would make them incredibly time consuming for the final output.

When I opened the box and played the game, I felt like I had been ripped off. This is Sim Theme Park with a new name and some slight changes. Sim Theme Park was not much better than Bullfrog's Theme Park.

The game had very little to do with building coasters. It uses the same system as Sim Theme Park which was an awful game. I thought that this game would be more similar to Roller coaster tycoon which in my opinion was the best game of 2000 or 1999 whenever it was that ot came out.

I'm writing this review because there are bootleg 4-packs floating around. I wouldn't even care, if the quality of the bootlegs was good. Dual layer dvd's would have been fine. As it is, the video quality of the shows are poor because the discs have been compressed to single layer DVDs. My advice is to buy the shows separately or buy the 4-pack directly from Amazon.

The publisher does not give you one hint that this is an enjoyable book with a character you really like (even if she is a lawyer - how did the author manage that?) Don't be put off by the cover.

Undying is the best action game this year, but Max & Wolfenstein are coming. Undying is not really scarrier than Half Life. Great graphics, fun to play and runs smooth. Best story yet, if you read everything. Downsides are: constant loadings, steep computer requirement, no gore filter, rather short. NOT FOR LITTLE KIDS! You can learn the ropes on easy setting, and then rock on medium difficulty. Has some replay value. Alice was good, but Undying is much better! The body count is low, relative to Unreal, Quake, Serious Sam. Part action, part FPS-you might only die every half hour or so, instead of twice a minute. No hard puzzles, no jumping, not much swimming, no rocket packs! The weapons don't suck, like Alice. I needed a walk-through to kill the 5 bosses, otherwise it would take some time to learn. Always demo before you buy..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmm...er....","review":"First off I would like to congratulate EA for making a SUPERB trailer for Undying, hell, I was caught off guard, I began my immediate purchase on my road for supah-dupah disappointment.It's not scary, I think it's even funny. The characters arent scary, the SFX SUX, the textures are almost too wide, its ridiculous. I really tried hard to be scared but I just couldnt. I tried to enjoy it but I failed. It's like playing Counter Strike while on PCP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Undying: Fun Dies Quickly","review":"It is disturbing to me that so many respected reviewers are praising a first person shooter without Multiplayer with 9.0+ and 5 star scores. Undying is a fair entertainment product that uses the Unreal Engine. It is not a ground breaking program, nor important piece of gaming history. It is a fair game bacause it accomplishes to create a horrific and spooky atmosphere using sound and inspired level design. It is unimportant due to failure in almost every other department. The single player game can be finished quickly in a few days and replay value is zero, considering the linear scripted story, which is under-developed to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"The bugs are coming! The bugs are coming!","review":"It could have been easily the game of the year. It's downright horrifying and intense. With such masterpiece graphics, sounds and feel it is easy to forgive the lack of replay value. But, BUT, the horrible bugs inroduced to the game, along with a bad-balnced gameplay, just ruined it all. The weapons are lame, the control imprecise. Far too many mouse - excercise jumping exactly from here to there wear down the experience. Then there are the bugs- no doubt the worst monstaers out there. You must not ever drain the spears from the speargun- do so and no weapon will ever shoot again. Ah, and there are plenty more for you there. Try and see for yourself- your dissapointment is assured."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most FANTASTIC and scariest game I have EVER played","review":"I have nothing but good things to say about this game! I am a Clive Barker fanatic, and waited on pins and needles for this to come out. I was not disappointed, in fact, it far exceeded my expectations! Imagine every single book, short story, play and painting to bare the name Barker all rolled into one, and then placed with vivid clarity and backed by haunting music before you. For example, traverse the realms of the Imajica and battle the Cenobites, only bigger and better and down-right meaner. Well worth every single penny and every single second you'll spend with your eyes glued to your monitor. Pump up the music, make sure you have enough ram and a great video and sound and game care, and you will NOT be disappointed!Thank you Mr. Barker!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clive Barker's Undying","review":"Installation was a breeze and the intro captivating!

UNDYING is a game that will make you freak out in your own bedroom. You'll start to hear things even after turning off your PC. When you watch a movie, it would be much more interesting if you were in the story. Clive Barker knows that for people to see his world this is the best way to not only show it but experience it. You'll roam this huge mansion with creepy rooms, stairways, pictures....I've played alot of games but to tell you the truth, I've never played a game that makes me sit soo tight in my seat. Once you start playing, you'll wish your computer doesn't have a sound card.So buy it, and trust me, you'll enjoy the hell out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chilling to the bone!!!","review":"It didn't take long after starting a new game of my own to realize the true genius behind this game. The audio system adds to the bone-chilling theme and the graphics are spectacularly detailed. I am a little partial to strategy games and if you are the same this is a must have game. I have yet to finish the game, but it doesn't take long after undertaking the journey as Patrick Galloway to grasp the depth and the mandatory mentality to succesfully complete Clive Barker's Undying. One other thing that makes this game unique and even more horrifying is that instead of the curse instead of the Covenant curse ending in the annihalation of the Covenant family is that it doesn't end there. It would seem to me that there is a much more sinister force at work and the game will only reveal pieces of the final solution until it is time for the final fight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary as Hell","review":"Ok.let me tell you this is the abselut scaryeiest game i have ever played.The graphics are great.Sound is great.It was so scary i almost wet my pants.The story is so good.IM telling you try dearying playing the game at nigth[i have i got very sceard].If you like silent hill resident evil and alone in the dark this is a game for you.

Perhaps because of its rating. Nevertheless, this is a wonderful game with a very very nice story, excellent characters, really pretty graphics for its time, SUPERB sound effects, and a chilling soundtrack that all comes together magically to give the player an unforgettable horror-movie like FPS experience.I remember the times I used to play this game at home with all the lights turned off. And seriously, there were many times I jumped with horror, or times I couldn't take the fear of waiting to be killed in the dark or fear of being attacked, and shut down my PC.The weapons, spells, enemies, enemy AI, dialogue, script, plot, whatever you need in a great FPS, this game has it.At this price range today, if you like the genre, this is a MUST BUY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much blood, not enough game play","review":"This game was difficult to play because the character was hard to maneuver (you see through his eyes), the controls were not user friendly, and at the drop of a hat, monsters are ripping your head off. Yuck! There are no fun puzzles and clues to figure out, it is just a bunch of running around chasing \\"bad guys\\". This is ok for the blood thirsty teen-ager, but not for someone who genuinely loves a good thought inspiring interactive game. If you are like me, get \\"The Longest Journey\\".

There is no flavor to it what-so-ever. You can't taste the potatoes or the butter, all you taste is flour and it's very dry. It used to be better years ago when it slightly resembled the taste of potatoes, but as it is with many items, they must have found ways to save a buck at the expense of the quality & flavor. Don't waste your money! You're better off investing in the equipment to make your own, or finding a website that sells an authentic \\"home-made\\" variety.

Airborne... Echinacea...Emergen-C.... the list goes on. The issue with products like this is that you never know \\"would the cold have gone away on its own if I hadn't taken these supplements?\\"However, having said that, I really do think these tablets work. I've been in the \\"catching a cold\\" mode several times this past 6 months and each time I take a couple of these right away and then every 4-8 hours (as I can remember them). Usually I wake up the next morning feeling much better. Once I didn't catch it right away (I was in denial that I was getting sick) and the tablets didn't work... perhaps they helped speed the recovery.So, realistically, I think these are worth trying. They work for me and I'm going to keep using them. Your mileage may vary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Imitation of a Quality Tool","review":"This product is nothing more than an expensive imitation of a high quality Festool rail system with saw. This product is more expensive than what is widely regarded as a superior product. The Festool rails with the Festool saw are built to much higher tolerances than this system with a conventional rotary saw. The results are far superior with Festool system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased in Wisconsin","review":"Kind of hard to add to what's already been said! I've owned mine for close to a year and also have the Smart Table. Before owning the SG system, I dealt with offsetting straight-edges to the cutting blade, splintered cuts, inaccuracy, performing (trying to anyway) dangerous cuts on the table saw, avoiding other \\"interesting\\" cuts altogether and making hundreds of un-necessary passes on my jointer to get a square edge. With my EZ SG system, I can happily say all that is history! This is quite simply, one extremely well designed and engineered piece of woodworking equipment! The fit, finish and quality of all the components are all first class! In my mind, all of the above truly helps in the execution of the quality in the final piece I'm working on and that, after all, is what it's all about! Highly recommended. Two thumbs up!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, except...","review":"This is a nice tool, EXCEPT I soon discovered the depth of the maximum cut using my Milwaukee 6390 would NOT go all the way through 2x stock. I contacted EurekaZone and asked them about that, they said Yes, it's true, we forgot to mention that in our literature. I returned it the next day. I was trying to save some bucks instead of buying a Festool -- a mistake. If you want to use this on 2x stock you'd better make sure first that your circular saw will work with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"laugh til it hurts","review":"One of the best I've seen in a long time.

Extremely derivative, never though-provoking, and seldom actually funny. Some of the jokes here are not only stolen, they're stolen from people who did them 20 years ago. Gabriel has a lot of charisma on stage and I think people may get drawn into that without realizing there's just no material to back it up.

I read it for school, and had to write a book report on it. But I couldn't find anything good to say about it. I am assuming it's due to my having been a girl, and being interested in \\"girl things\\".The boy never actually does anything TRULY bad at all. He's just an ordinary boy, with a rash of bad luck. I found the story to be dull, monotonous, and annoying, in that nothing ever really happens. Well, things happen, but nothing that seemed to merit writing an entire book about it. I believe that a boy could possibly like this book, but if you are considering having a girl read it... please spare her the torture. There is plenty of literature available for girls. I personally will be sparing my boys as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"The name of the story implies some good spoanking scenes. There were none in the whole book.

Dune is one of those traditions being kept alive for ten years.The first Dune II was pretty good. Still, the graphics, music, soundeffects, and difficulty were not the best.Dune 2000 had its graphics and difficulty amplified, while disregarding music and sef.Now Emperor has everything. The plot is intricate and interesting. Graphics are amazing, so are the new units. Great music and sef. It is a little difficult to play, so I would advice playing Dune 2000 first.In Emperor you play three houses: powerful harkonnen, loyal atreides, deceitful ordos- and five unique subhouses. Each has unique technology and strengths. You try to defeat the computer and take control of Dune.You play so many levels. Every new level you get new units and structures. The units get veterancy bonuses.Good Luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"RTS has a bad rap.","review":"RTS games have developed this bad rap of all of them basically being the same game. I think this is why some reviewers are so hard on RTS games, even great ones like Dune. The Graphics are beautiful, the game is not linear and has an amazing RISK style structure. You don't feel like your playing out a story, but controlling a storyline yourself. Plus with 50+ missions per side you are bound to have enough replay value to justify the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slow and clunky","review":"Being a hard-core C&C/RE fan, I was excited to pick up Emperor this weekend. But after installing and playing it, I found it to be way too slow and clunky. I have a decent PC - PIII 750 128 megs etc. but I found the interface slow to use, the screen very slow to scroll, and the missions took forever to load. I found myself wanting to load up RE2 and play it. Maybe the upgrades will speed up the game to be playable, until then I am back on RE2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emperor: Battle For Dune","review":"What a great update to Dune 2000. The sounds and graphics are great and it works fine on my Windows XP Pro Laptop. No freeze ups and the only minor quirks that I noticed is that sometimes the rendering of a unit (most often the harvestor) shows \\"cloaked\\" when it's not really cloaked. Also, telling the harvestors to mine spice in a certain area sometimes doesn't \\"stick\\" to the orders given. This game has given me many hours (days/weeks) worth of single player real time strategy fun without getting into the complication like Age of Mythology. I only wish we could team up the computer AI to fight against you as the computer AIs will fight one another and you if you select more than one player in the skirmish battle. I haven't played the game online (who knows if people play this game anymore with Age Of Mythology and Age of Empires out there). This is a cult classic that is very enjoyable. If you liked DUNE 2000 then get Emperor: Battle For Dune. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"somehow playable","review":"Great gameplay, the best base building formula RTS i've played in a long time. Right up there with Ground Control. Only downside is the fact that you're fighting on arrakis. what a horrible planet. ah, yes, and the game plays a little too fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game!","review":"If you are a fan of Frank Herbert's Dune saga then you will like this RTS, though many details have been changed and some outright ignored. Still, all in all, it kept me playing through all missions of all 3 Houses (Harkonnen was my favorite). If you play Command & Conquer you might find this system a tad simpler but the storyline makes it fun...well I thought so at least."},{"rating":"2","title":"A decent game","review":"This is, now, an older Real Time Strategy game. However it still has nice features such as selecting all units of a type, and formation moves (everyone moves at the speed of the slowest unit).It runs without any special configuration on Windows Vista.It is fairly easy and should be played at the higher difficulty levels if you are familiar with this game type. While the AI sometimes does not take advantage of certain opportunities, I did have the computer invade my base and take over buildings with engineers.They do a decent job of cut scenes that are done in the style of the Dune movie given how old this game is now.Note that the Harkonnen is the hardest side to play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorely disappointed","review":"For a start, the game is incredibly demanding on hardware, even if you turn down all the graphics settings. My computer's about a year old, and has good sound/video cards as well as up-to-date drivers, but the game keeps freezing whenever it gets busy.Secondly, with the 3D graphics it's really hard to tell the units apart, unless you zoom right in.Thirdly, your own units are incredibly stupid: They're magnetically attracted to the enemy's guns, even when you specifically select a safer route.And finally, everything happens so fast that you never get a chance to defend - either you've put up enough defences in the first place, or when the enemy attacks, it's all over in a few seconds."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game would be fun.. if I could play it...","review":"I'm sure this game would be great, if it would run on my computer. I have windows ME, a pentium 4 1.7, a geforce 3, 256 ram, sblive, latest drivers... and for some reason, westwood (the developer) couldnt bother to test it on a new system? I've tried costumer support, no help there, but i did discover pleanty of other problems other people have had with the game. Also, the minimun requierments are far short of what you really need, this game requires a lot more then they say, not to mention that if you have an athlon processor, it wont run. And system requirements are the irony where my problem lies with this game.. because I have one of the only systems that would run the game in all its visual glory."},{"rating":"1","title":"emperor battle for the dune","review":"i can't say what i think of the game i can't get play on windows 7 i look at all the reviews ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take AofE, add sand, voila","review":"I would normally try to give you a comprehensive review, but if you're always looking for the next best RTS (like me) you're probably already familiar with this game.Forget about comparing it to previous Dune titles. I'm constanly running into the same game with different fixings: C&C, Age of Empires, Star Wars, and now Dune. Collect, spend, fight, collect, spend, fight. Boring but still fun if you haven't tired of the same old formula."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a bad rehash","review":"Emporer is a well done 3D rehash of all the other Westwood Studios real time strategy games. This time however, most combat turns into a battle of attrition forcing even more unit buliding than in the C&C and RA games. They spent a lot of time/money on full motion video that could have been better spent on new, innovative units and gameplay tweaking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be atredies(i know im a bad speller)","review":"well, another game from westwood, another very unfair game from westwood. This game graphics r pretty bad(good for the time though) so im not going to complain about that. The one thing that made my rating for it so low was because the ONLY tactic the computers use is mass rushing, which ive noticed the atredies are by far best at. They have the best unit in the game by the way, which has best attack force,and best defence Its speed is preety terrible, but if you try to run out in the open to try to kill it, the other computers attack you before you can as much as weaken it. I wouldn't reccommend this game to any new real time strategy players; however i would reccommend it to people who enjoy rushing games."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unplayable","review":"The manual does not provide enough information on unit costs, strengths, and weaknesses. The UI is badly designed and does not allow you to build, deploy units, and manage operations at the pace required by the game. The units move and act stupidly; when I order a group to move to an area of the map they seem to take random circuitous routes, and when they encounter enemies they will not shoot unless specifically ordered to do so, even if they are fired upon. Stay away from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be carefull of what you ask for.","review":"Bummer. Couldn't even install this game on our computer. At first, we thought we'd received a bad version and reordered a replacement. Then, after hours on-line with tech support, Westwood decided our Celeron processor doesn't meet the requirements. Boo hoo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dune II gets a serious overhaul !","review":"This game has all the flavor of the original Dune II, but the graphics are a lot nicer. As in the original Dune II you can pick from one of the three houses for the campaign; Atredies, Ordos, or Harkonnen's. This time, though, you can pick up unique troops depending on what subhouses you ally with as you go through the campaign. They've also added (I don't remember if the original had this) multiplayer capabilities.For this game it does feel like they took the original game added a lot more depth (including many cinematic clips) and alot better graphics!! If you liked the original you'll love this remake.FYI: They also made the worms a whole lot bigger :)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome","review":"I take lessons and sometimes ride bare back.

Never even got to the supposed plot of her new husband, who was tricked into marrying her, cheating on their honeymoon with some other women so she goes back to her lying family and her husband tries to win her back at a charity auction.

It is one of the best books I have ever read about the overall crime history of Chicago, but it took 204 pagess to get to the \\"Bugs\\" part. Once you reach the last chapter, it seems the author was in a hurry to finish it leaving so many questions unaswered."},{"rating":"1","title":"the Bugs Moran Story","review":"Chicago legend has it that George \\"Bugs\\" Moran was a rival of Capone, and this spirited biography does its best to make it seem that way. In reality, the gang was never firmly organized and was not a threat to anyone after \\"Hymie\\" Weiss was killed. Rose Keefe packs her book with colorful detail to make up for all that is unknown about Moran and the fact that he was not very interesting. Keefe seems to think the primary interest of the North Side gang in the early 20s was bootleging when, actually, it was safecracking with insider information. This book is a \\"good read,\\" but when you're done with it you won't know much about \\"Bugs\\" Moran."},{"rating":"2","title":"Painted Raven","review":"Painted Raven is awesome.

This item is a must for world music enthusiasts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"The first 6 dragonlance books (Chronicles and Legends Trilogies) remain for me, the greatest works in Fantasy ever written. The poor rating I give to this volume is due only to the useless commentary that I so hoped would provide insight into the story. What the authors merely do is provide offhand comments that either repeat themselves or detail things that I found uninteresting. I was seeking more detail into what Raistlin had experienced in his journey, ie..what actually went on when Soth and Raistlin first encountered each other in Shoiken Grove. What did Raistlin face when he entered the Abyss and battled the Dark Queen's army. Why did the mage council simply not kill Raistlin outright. Why did the Dragonlance Adventures book have such inappropriate stats for the characters involved in this story. Alas, none of these were answered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fantasy Novel","review":"First off, the notations are for the most part pretty useless. If it is your first time reading the Legends, I suggest not reading the notations at all, they give away too much foreshadowing.The Legends series is the best Dragonlance series in my opinion. The charactors have good depth, and just enough is kept out so that the next plot twists are not over exposed. Raistlin is especially great, one of my more favorite literary characters. Tas is overly silly, and Cameron to transparent. The plot line is a little out there, and not very intuitive, but it is decent. It really is the characters and well described landscapes that keep this together. Any D&D; fan will find this well worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!!","review":"One of my favorite stories, and the annotations were a welcome Commentary to the edition. This edition is a must for hardcore Dragonlance fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother!","review":"My mistake in purchasing this rake was in thinking because it was made of bamboo it would be light so raking leaves or grass would be much less tiresome. What isn't stated in the written description is that the \\"fingers\\" of the rake curve over severly and are very short, hence only a small amount of material can be raked before one has to stop and unclog the rake. Makes for very frustrating and time-consuming yard work when I'd rather be doing anything in the yard already than raking. So now it's sitting in the corner after only being used twice. Don't understand the 5-star reviews previously! My opinion is, don't waste your money on this one but look for a normal, well-made rake with metal fingers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ghost-written with the ghost of Philip Dick?","review":"Actually, Chalker manages to incorporate his favourite themes: that stagnation leads to Hell, his fascination with how much power corrupts, and what some call an obsession with transformation. If nothing else, his \\"first world\\" in this book brilliantly analyses what would happen if women really did have power. David Brin did an equally good (albeit different) job, and few others have avoided the standard clichés. As a conclusion to his most paranoid trilogy, the book is brilliant, up to the last chapter. Fans of the late Phil Dick (of whom I am one) should recognise it as the last chapter of Dick's own book UBIK. This lack of originality nonetheless fits in with one of the most paranoid trilogies I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mystery and Mayhem","review":"Picked up a copy of this from the free book cart at the local library.

The tensions this creates propell one through the book, leaving no room for apathy or boredom. By the time the reader has finished the book, he/she feels like part of the family and hates to \\"leave\\".Michael's on-going theme of \\"family helping family\\" is a welcome value statement offseting the commentary of greed and self-indulgence that her \\"bad\\" characters manifest.I look forward to reading the next two books of this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"could NOT put this series books down!!!","review":"start in order with the texas series, and then follow with the Vegas series and the Ky. series.I literally was staying up all night because these books made me feel like I actually knew the family..I was fully engrossed in this series and loved every word.I love to read and have read many authors, but Fern Michaels has a way to make you feel like you are right there with them.I could picture every person in my mind.if you want a good read this summer, I suggest buying the whole series at one time.....they have them boxed that way.you will NOT be disappointed!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vagas Rich, Vagas Sunrise, Vagas xxxx","review":"Read all three books in this series and was very happy with the story.

There are chapters for each trimester and also for various topics such as hopes and dreams, values, the future. Each page starts off with a little sentence to get you going such as \\"The first person we told that we were pregnant was...\\". There is also a space on the top of the page to say who is writing the entry (Mom or Dad), the date of the entry, and the baby's age at that entry.One warning though: This book has many religious references. If you're not religious, you may find some of the pages unnecessary. This wasn't a problem for me and my husband, but I do think people who are less religious may be taken back by some of the pages that focus on God."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what expected","review":"I was not aware this was a Christian book and I am not a Christian, nor is the pregnant woman that I purchased the book for.

If not, I would suggest something else. If it was just a few pages, I probably would have kept the book and just skipped those pages. But, there are QUITE A FEW PAGES... THIS BOOK WAS CLEARLY MADE FOR CHRISTIAN PEOPLE. And I am just not comfortable with that. I was highly disappointed because I would love to share spiritual things with my child, and the rest of the writing topics were fine. If the pages had just been worded differently so they were more of a spiritual nature than a pure CHRISTIAN nature.... I mean, to each his own. But, this obviously wasn't the book for me.

This book seemed to get published in Leedskalnins' exact words, as it has a few mis-spellings, and missing punctuation. I think the most disappointing part was how I was noticing small diagrams everywhere for the sample pages and examples, but in the book, there is only text. The concepts presented were interested, but very few at that.

His theories are way out there! He is not consistent in his writings, For example he starts by saying the magnets are of two parts a north magnet and a south magnet, what we today call the uni-poles which remains to be found. These magnets travel in pairs of NS but in opposite direction, the north magnet from the north pole moving to the south and the south magnet moving northward to the north pole. Later in the book he reverses the direction they are moving! his experiments a dull and for the most part miss interpreted, by the writer.

After the lock solenoids were installed, I needed to added a couple of relays to make the AA925 operate the locks, cheap though at $2 ea off ebay.Also programming has to be done carefully. My first attempts were really reprogramming the remotes, until everything got messed up. Got the remote programming manual on-line (it SHOULD have been in with the unit), straightened out the programming, and it works perfectly. Decent range, lights flash, horn toots, and it CAN be used for remote start with another relay installed ($2) and can disable the ignition (another $2 relay), but I didn't go that way.Looking forward to completing my task of making the trunk opener working, this is a neat project, great value, just a little more trouble than I anticipated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Happy","review":"Unless you are an electrical engineer, do not purchase this with the intent to self-install it in a Chrysler product with a one-wire lock/unlock system. After about a week and half of trying to install it myself (with 2 calls to Audiovox's technical support people), I finally had to take it to a professional. To make it work, the professional had to add another part (at a cost of $57.00). The final insult is that to make the system unlock all doors you have to (1) press the unlock button, (2) wait until the driver's door unlocks, and (3) exactly 3 seconds after the driver's door unlocks, press the unlock button a second time. Failure to follow this procedure exactly results in extreme frustration (but not unlocked doors)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audiovox AA925 Security and Remote Start System WRONGLY LABELED","review":"I order two and thought I got an excellent price.The Audiovox AA925 is advertised as a Security and Remote Start System.It is wrongly described and does not have these features.The instructions only described setting up the keyless entry.There were no directions or wires for the remote start and security features.I called Audiovox technical support, in order to pick their brains.The technician confirmed that it ONLY was capable of these features.I asked him \\"please explain exactly what you mean by capable\\"?He explained those features only work with optionally purchased controllers.The controller for the remote start was another $70.00 add on.I didn't ask about the security one, since I was only interested in remote start.I recently returned them to Amazon for a full refund, since they were mis-represented.So be advised: This is ONLY a Keyless Entry System !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed the audiotape which is in Michael Dell's own voice","review":"Dell has been a pioneer in accelerating the velocity of inventory throughout the supply chain.

Dell started out in his dormroom making computers for customers and now is worldwide. Dell takes you through every step of the way in his monstorous growth.

You get a better idea of what happened in the 1990's with computers through Dell's unique perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reminds Me","review":"I agree with another revew (devpd's), in that a lot of the songs remind me of other electronic artists' work. I swear \\"Poor Leno\\" sounds like a boppier version of something off the new Underworld CD, and \\"A Higher Place\\" sounds like Moby, and the list goes on. I don't think it's a bad thing though, since it's not just a bland copy of other groups, they're great songs by their own merit. Sometimes a group can sound so derivative that listening is no fun, but this certainly doesn't go that way.A couple of the songs are a bit weak, but overall they don't detract that much. A CD with no weak tracks is extremely rare, in my opinion, but this comes reasonably close.The music videos on the bonus CD are a real treat too, I really liked the Poor Leno video, and the Remind Me video kept me laughing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Every Penny (and then some)","review":"A very very good album, and I can safely say it will be one of my few \\"classic albums\\" that I will play for many years to come.

Ordered and paid for on 11-09-06 and received on 11-24-06."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant enough","review":"There is a reason that one of these selections is the catchy tune on one of the caveman commercials. It's \\"elevator\\" music or more exactly airport music, that innocuous background music that many people seem to hate. Generally it's a very pleasant CD of listenable background music. This isn't a masterpiece of edgy electronica; it's fine for playing while you are doing something else and it doesn't demand your whole attention. It was especially fun to hear the entire song from the Geico commercial, which is the reason I, and I suspect many others, bought this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, this is good stuff!","review":"I have to admit that I was intrigued to check this CD out because of the Geico commercial, but I'm really glad I did! I love metal music more than you know & this CD actually opened my mind more than I could have imagined! If you want music that you can relax to & feel good, then I highly recommend this CD...& not only is the catchy Geico song (Remind Me) on there, but the whole CD is great! Check it out for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a few good tracks","review":"Quite inconsistent. I liked \\"Remind Me\\" ( the GEICO commerical ) and \\"Poor Leno\\"... Better to support the artist by buying downloads individually."},{"rating":"1","title":"remind me and eple are great, the rest is mediocre","review":"Like so many others, I tracked this down because of the Geico commercial. Remind Me is a brilliant pop track..it's unique and it sticks in your head. Then there's Eple, which is equally catchy even though it's an instrumental. Poor Leno almost cuts it, but beyond the hooky chorus, it's a bore as listening material...maybe good for dancing if that's your thing. The rest of the disc varies from mediocre to unlistenable. She's So features some horrible b-movie saxophone and all the other tracks have variously annoying traits and no songwriting or vocal work of the caliber of Remind Me.My advice...buy Remind Me and Eple at itunes store and skip the rest. Sorry Amazon. Your mileage may vary."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's snowing now.....","review":"Seriously, it's snowing mounds and mounds now right outside my window, and the winter hymns of Royksopp's Melody A.M. provide the perfect soundtrack. \\"So Easy\\" opens the wintry festivities, sampling Bobby Vinton's \\"Blue on Blue\\" to chilling (and funky) effect. \\"Eple\\", \\"Poor Leno\\" and \\"Royksopp's Night Out\\" invite you to dance away your winter blues; while \\"Sparks\\", \\"In Space\\" and \\"She's So\\" make you want to curl up beside the fire with your baby and a cup of hot chocolate. Perfect for snow days and sunny days alike, Melody A.M. is sweet and sunkissed, without being sacchrine. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Daft Punk on Valium","review":"I just bought this CD from a local record store two days ago, and I can't stop listening to it. I think every track is great, which to me is saying something. I disagree with others that this sounds like \\"typical 80's\\" music, but if you're into downtempo electronica (i.e., Air, Zero 7, Thievery Corporation), and haven't heard this yet, I'd definitely recommend giving it a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant Surprise","review":"I bought the album after hearing the partial song on the Geico ad. I was pleasantly surprised to find myself enjoying the entire album. The style is fresh and the album is upbeat, but varies from song to song. The Geico song was the closest to 'elevator music' on the album.I would recommend this album to anyone who likes progressive pop/rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Understanding is better","review":"This is one of those CD's that are good for one song. \\"Remind Me\\" from the Geico Caveman commercial where he is in the airport and sees his poster on the wall. It is clear that Royksopp has done much better with their newest CD \\"The Understanding\\" it has at least 3 good songs. I like Royksopp when they actually create music instead of certain cacophonous filler material.\\"Remind Me\\", \\"Only This Moment\\", \\"What Else Is There?\\", and \\"49 Percent\\" are their best works, 3 of which are found on the CD \\"The Understanding\\".They are pretty good, but if they really want to impress, they should continue writing songs like \\"Only This Moment\\" and \\"What Else Is There?\\".\\"Remind Me\\" is cool, but I was disappointed with the rest of the boring stuff on the \\"Melody A.M.\\" CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"NORWEGIAN NOTHING","review":"The Amazon editorial review for Royksopp's \\"Melody A.M.\\" declares, \\"Arguably the best album of 2002\\". Well, here's the argument: This is derivative drivel. Minimal song structures with elaborate trappings consisting of dropped and bent notes to make the contrived melody more interesting. The constant weak musical passages serving as songs give way to worn lyrical melodies making the whole CD ring like a shallow musical grave. At best, the third track, \\"Sparks\\" sounds like England's 'Broadcast' after a few double martinis and the fifth, \\"Poor Leno\\" is certainly late '90s 'Everything But the Girl\\". I'll be darned if I don't hear 'The Pet Shop Boys' in here as well if you were to poke them with a stick and force them to make a new album. It all sounds very familiar and I suspect it's a case of buried and disguised plagiarism."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated","review":"There's nothing here that struck me as anything more than background music for shopping at Victoria's Secret.

I thought since that song was so bubbly and fun to listen to that the rest would be similar. I was wrong. I can admit it. The rest of the songs are boring, uninspired, and lifeless. You might like that sort of thing, so be sure to listen to it before you buy. I played it 3 times. Once for the first listen, twice because I thought I may have been ingoring some subtlties, and 3 times just to make sure it sucks.

Most notable of these is the almost adorable cutesiness of the style.

After hearing Eple on many compilations, I decided to see what the CD was like. I listened to a few samples online, and wasn't expecting much.

Mory catchy than albums by Groove Armada and Zero 7, I highly recommend this to lovers of melodic and quite fashionable, down tempo, dance music and urge everyone to spread the word. Stand-out tracks include the house-y \\"Poor Leno,\\" \\"Remind Me\\" (check out the superb remix) and \\"So Easy.\\" This US version includes the bonus remixes of \\"Poor Leno\\" and \\"Remind Me\\" which are definately worth it, since they are hard to come by.

Stanko makes no disclaimer that the men focused on in her book are NOT the majority of men in society. Stanko further suggests that all men want to inflict violence toward women, and that all women should fear all men because of man's uncontrollable, animal-like inhibitions. This book does not help the tension between some males and some females, it exacerbates it. Stanko uses trivial examples of rapes and violent crimes against women to indicate her own loathe of men.

His translations, at times daring linguistically, bring a fresh vitality to Chekhov's plays. I am especially fond of his translations of Uncle Vanya and The Cherry Orchard. New generations of Chekhov readers will find Schmidt's work interesting, accessible, and energetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Modern American Translation Betrays Chekhov","review":"Schmidt's translation sounds smooth to a modern American, and thus eases the American actor's job. It fails, however, to bring the real Chekhov to the English language. Chekhov's writing has a rhythm, a compactness, and a vocabulary that is uniquely his, one that inimitably captures a very distinctive slice of Russian life as it existed one hundred years ago. It is possible to show this slice to an English speaking audience, but Schmidt had no interest in doing this. That is why this translation is a failure.A secondary but equally unforgiveable fault is that he adds his own stage direction to the text. For instance, he adds the word \\"beat\\" to the text in places where Chekhov had nothing at all. The American concept of a stage \\"beat\\" had not even been invented yet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dislikes new translation","review":"Although the author does a very good job putting the text of the plays into the modern English vernacular, I feel as though the works have had their flavor removed.

The first part of the book makes for very interesting reading and I found, is in itself, a martial arts guide that can be referred back to. If you are a student of Aikido or you are thinking of starting on such a path, then careful study of this book should assist you in the development and quality of your training and help you to better understand O'Sensei's ideals for this 'living' art. A very good book by Sensei Suenaka and Mr. Watson"},{"rating":"1","title":"not complete Aikido","review":"\\"Complete Aikido\\" is anything but complete. Only 53 of the 289 pages are about waza (the actual moves). They state openly at the beginning of that section that these are merely a few selected waza instead of the complete 50 basic moves. For someone looking to supplement their instruction or review what they learned, this is far from complete. For someone looking to learn Aikido from a book, this is definitely the wrong choice. Its only saving grace is that is does have a good coverage of the spiritual side of Aikido and its history and founder.

My kid likes it as much as I did!","review":"Yes, the animation is dated. Yes, the plot is kind of corny BUT my daughter is just as enchanted as I was (and still am). You can't miss with this one! Pete's Dragon shows you what it means to be a kid with an unbelievable (only to the grown-ups) best friend who helps you out when you think that there's no one else left to care. The songs are still catchy and the baddies are still scary. The DVD is sooooo much better than VHS; and unlike my VHS copy there is no fear of it wearing out from over-playing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pete's Dragon","review":"I had a VCR of Pete's Dragon, but could not find it.

I remember going to see at the movies and getting the reading record for christmas.This is one of the most over looked Disney's. Nothing beats the \\"I saw a dragon \\" scene with Mickey Rooney. Another fun scene is the \\"I've got a bill of sale right here\\" that lands all the foster familiy in mud which tickles all the kids I've shared this film with.

Unfortunately, the disc skipped several times and stopped completely after a while, so we returned it for a replacement. We received a replacement but had the same problem with that disc as well. All of our other DVDs work fine, so we're confident the problem lay with the actual disc and not our DVD player. We were informed that there was a \\"widespread problem\\" with this title and no more replacements would be available.

Whew."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mind-Numbing Drivel","review":"There is two hours of my life, and my childrens' lives, that we'll never get back. The plot meanders. The dialogue is insipid.

Not one of the children paid any attention to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Preety good kids movie","review":"Obviously if you are an adult this movie is not going to hold as much magic for you as it once did but for a young child this movie still does its job. I remember when I first watched this one(oh I was about 7) All I wanted to see Pete do was talk to the dragon and take rides on it's back. However as I grew a little older and actually started to pay attention to the plot I wanted to see all the bad guys get what was coming to them(I was about 9 by this point).So \\"Pete's Dragon\\" is a good development movie it will keep the very young kids interested while teaching slightly older kids that there is such a thing as a plotParts of it are kind of dark so don't show this to extremely young kids of will scare them(or at the very least freak them out a little bit). The only thing wrong with this movie is the fundamental flaw of most kids movies too young and the kids don't see the point, too old and the kids are bored by it. Still its all worth it just hear Elliot talk."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic!","review":"This is one of my favorite movies. I have watched it since I was a little girl.

The instructions said you can immerse in water and wash in dishwasher. When I did, the feet deteriorated and made black marks on my Corian counter top. I quit putting in dishwasher, I tried for six months to get new feet. Villaware Customer Service does not put items on back order and told me to call back -- I did once a month for six months they could not supply. Then this skillet developed large portions that would not heat enough to brown a grilled cheese sandwich, I called Customer Service again, they said it needed a new controller--which they did not have in stock.Recycled the thing and bought a cheaper Oster. I've used electric skillets for eons, I know they wear out, but in less than two years is unacceptable for an almost $100 appliance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun!","review":"This is a very enjoyable movie. You need to take it for what it is - made for kids on a low budget. The cast and crew evidently enjoyed making this film and it shows both in the movie and on the hour-long Behind the Scenes feature. If you want to check out some other reviews, go to the dvd 'Junior Pilot', it's an earlier release of the same movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks like a Capital B Movie to me","review":"I'm yet to give this a go but it looks like a great Big B movie to me..I mean check this out..It have Eric Roberts and Mark Ducosis or whatever his name is as it's major 'stars'.I managed to have about a 15 minute watch and just could not take anymore of what I was seeing.....I may give this another try in another fe months when I have nothing to do but watch paint dry or something along those lines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made into a well-known movie","review":"Seance on a Wet Afternoon is strongly atmospheric. As the other reviewers have mentioned, there is a pervasive sense of dread -- you just know that this is not going to turn out well. McShane's art is that he makes a serious crime plausible within the desperate frame of the fading psychic.Younger readers may not know that the book was made into an excellent British film in the mid 60s. Richard Attenborough and Kim Stanley were both nominated for or won awards for their performances. If you enjoyed the book, you might find the film a gripping complement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Henna product out there","review":"This really is chestnut color.

This one, NO. My hair hardly changed, and it has a sort of greenish looking tint to it (which is what color the henna was). I followed directions precisely and left it on my hair for 2 hours.

I have used better henna than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"No dye release","review":"I made a batch of this up 6 hours ago and have checked it on a regular basis for dye release, the only stain it left was a greenish tint when checking it.

At least the greys fade, it is not black, but it does not matter, as long the greys hide.

It looks very natural.However it is-no doubt-the messiest thing I have ever used to dye my hair with. It is a procedure to get it on the head and it's a procedure to get it off the head too. Everything takes very long and a lot of cleaning in between (and afterwards) is hard to avoid. The muddy-like texture splashes easy and gets all over, so watch out if you are not already a professional with using henna. Other than that I like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Natural Hair Dye","review":"This henna gives my hair a great red color. It is long lasting and strong but not bright or too red. It feels so good to use natural dyes. However it is a bit tricky getting used to using heat to set the color and it doesn't lighten hair, it only colors my original dark blond to red. I have taken to using lemons to lighten my hair in order to achieve the same color as I used to get from a box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the color I wanted..","review":"I tried to cancel this order like 2 minutes after I ordered it because I had gotten the wrong color. The seller emails me back, the next day, telling me I cannot because it was already being processed (even though they could have). But I decided to try this color anyways so I wouldn't of wasted my money...YEA RIGHT. I wasted my money. In my opinion this color is not what I expected. I had medium brown hair and it turned out orange...like a fiery red, sun orange. I hated it so bad I had to go to the store and pick up some different haircolor to get that crap off my head. Someone else may like it, but I sure didn't. And it didn't help the seller screwed me over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice feel but after but nowhere near to \\"burgundy\\" on my light brown hair","review":"I love the way my hair feels after application. It was like super-food for my hair. But while I don't hate the sort of chestnutty brown that it resulted in, I really was expecting a burgundy. The color chart had indicated that light brown hair (which I had) would be a shade of burgundy. Oh well ... too late now. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice early compilation","review":"This is the Raphael of Spain from 1966-1969 that started to invade first Latin America and eventually the States. These are the first real hits that jolted the AM radio then and which I recall when he transformed Pop music and even fashion. The other greatest hits are too eclectic and cover some earlier 1964-67 material. This one is a chunk or a polaroid of a specific time and it could have easily accomodated 20-25 songs. This \\"Ep\\" has at least half of the original soundtracks of his movies: I don't know whether (if nostalgia is the issue) would have been better just to do a limited reissue of his albums from 1966-69, which were GOOD. This is at least a nice attempt in that direction, and a reminder of my teen years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally found this collection!","review":"Excellent recopilation, including the song \\"Madre\\".

They have gone on to cook there own birthday cakes and make sunday breakfasts.

They both deserve much more airplay---if a conductor can summon the huge combined forces of a full symphony orchestra and chorus and soloists for Jean Sibelius' \\"Kullervo\\" Symphony (another favorite of mine that also deserves much more airplay), why not the two aforementioned works by Reinhold Gliere? This recording is definitely belongs at the top of the list for any serious devotee of Romantic and early 20th century Russian symphonic music."},{"rating":"1","title":"I realize Glière's \\"Ilya Murometz\\" has its fans, but....","review":"This performance of Glière's \\"Ilya Murometz\\" is an interminable, nearly 100-minute exercise in Late Romantic non-expression. The first hour might make for good background music, but only if one can abide a persistent drone of near-Wagnerian swelling and ebbing of massed strings -- Dramamine is not included. I realize the symphony has a program, but this might work better as a silent movie soundtrack; several grueling listens have failed to convince me otherwise.\\"Ilya Murometz\\" has its fervent fans, but if one truly wishes to be introduced to this bloated gargantua, I'd feel comfortable in suggesting almost any other recording, apparently all of which are either appreciably amended or reinterpreted for \\"listening compactness\\".

Unfortunately there are no such things on Amazon. The product description is either wrong or intentionally misleading and you can find the same low quality product from CHH Imports (#2147) advertized by multiple sellers, but rarely showing the true product picture. I wish Amazon, can do better job enforcing sellers to show honest picture or correct product identification. However, this chess set has strikingly different size of white and black pieces, the chessboard was scratched and squares are fake wood. This item will only work as a toy for young kids (although this might be dangerous since it contains small pieces).

Then, it took eight days for the order to arrive (which is a bit longish, eh?). But the real complaint is that there are ingredients in the \\"Boswella Cream\\" that were NOT listed with Amazon, and had I known of those ingredients, I would NOT have ordered the cream.

It seems to me that if your 5-yr old likes Craig Ferguson or your kids enjoyed SpongeBob in the year 2001 and those kids are now in Jr High or High school then buy this movie. Otherwise (if your kids haven't seen it yet), stick to SpongeBob Sq Pants Movie about Shell City."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"Terrible. Just terrible. I normally like Patchy the Pirate, but he was terrible and should not have been in this film. Even if he wasn't with him though, I would have given this a one star. The plot and acting were terrible.

This movie should never have been made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Late to the party!","review":"Why read this book when there is a first-hand account written by Knut Herkalid, \\"Skis Against the Atom?\\" Mears merely provides another review of history written sixty years after the events took place. Furthermore, his photographs are possibly the worst I have seen in a publication. Don't be fooled as I was. I am fascinated with this part of WWII history. I have Knut's book which is a first hand account from one of the heroes of Telemark. As well, I have Thomas Gallagher's very good history, \\"Assault in Norway.\\" Both are excellent and provide a great review and analysis of the efforts to destroy the Nazi's access to heavy water which was needed to make an atomic weapon.

The song itself is, for a real Radiohead fan, completely hypnotic. The haunting, slow burn of the guitar paired with the beautiful anger of the lyrics make it, in my opinion, one of the best B-sides they've ever produced and makes me look forward to the next release even more.

They are great and have never leaked. I really enjoy the new bags because of the adapter that allows you to pump milk directly into the bags a bit easier that the plastic flap they had before. I've had a few accidents with the plastic flap tearing, rendering the bag useless. The new adapter alleviates that problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"I approve","review":"I am a mother or two and have breastfed by eldest daughter (18 months) and I am current breastfeeding our newest edition (1 month). The bags are indeed useful and relatively easy to use. I find that the strap to keep the bag on is soo great and helps alot during the day. With two young children in the home it is quite tedious to clean the attachments and bottle after every use. I am currently feeding my daughter as usual and pumping on the side to build by milk supply and store for daddy-daughter feeding times. Cons: I do not care for the height of the bag above the zip lock feature. I find that I have to rinse out that portion after i seal that bag which of course wastes milk. It could have a great capacity as well (5 oz max). However, in spite of that, I would recommend this product as thus it receives 4 stars from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Good","review":"I hate these bags! They don't seal right which defeats the purpose of the bag & are horribly hard to pour the milk out of..hello ease is everything with motherhood.

If you are pumping for a NICU baby, nurses do not like to handle the bags to transfer the milk into the volu-feeders/small hospital bottles (if you're lucky enough even to be in a breastfeeding-friendly hospital). Nurses are still handling a bodily fluid and it's extra steps for them if you're not the one handling all of the feedings. Also, the bags do not stand up on their own, which is frustrating if you're truly pumping straight into the bag. Like other reviewers, I found that the top tab tore poorly also. They are good for fast backup if you have no other sterile reusable milk storage container, but I ended up using theMedela Breastmilk Freezing & Storage (*BPA Free) 12 Pack of 80ml Bottles in Retail Packaging #87061long-term and was very happy with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"I've used Medela Pump & Save bags since our 4-month old was born and I cannot WAIT to run out of them. They don't hold very much at all. It's labeled to hold 5+ ounces, but in reality, they barely hold 4. They're made of a thin plastic and I worry about ink contamination. They also don't lay flat easily for freezer storage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to snuff","review":"I initially went with this product as it was the same brand as the pump that I have at home and at work. The Medela bags only hold 5 ounces and trying to close them when they're full can be tricky. Also, just yesterday I was informed by my baby's daycare provider that now a third bag of milk that I had provided frozen had leaked when it was thawed. I was shown the bag and it has a crack in the bag about 3/4 of an inch long. That wasn't there when I filled the bag or put it in the freezer.I have recently switched over to the Lansinoh. They hold 6 ounces measured, but there is plenty of room for more without overflows when sealing the bag. The double ziplock is a nice feature. Also, the material that the bag is made from is softer and less brittle which I believe may have been the issue with the Medela bags."},{"rating":"1","title":"Convenient but Disappointed","review":"These bags are very convenient when used with the pump in style however the seals are not good. I did take the time to make sure (I thought) the bags were sealed. The first 3 bags I used all leaked.

Much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lansinoh's are better","review":"These bags leak pretty often from the zipper closure and only hold 5 oz.

Yes, you can pump into them, but the top will basically be open so unless you're really careful, they are easy to spill. I now just pump into bottles and pour the bottles into the bags.The zip-top seal is very hard to close tight, you'll think it's sealed but it's not, or else it pops open after you close it. I've had multiple spills and leaks because of this.If you fill the bag to the 5oz line at the top, when you freeze it the contents will expand and open the top.Also, the measurement lines on the bag are not accurate at all unless you fill the bag - in which case you don't need them. The first several times I pumped, I thought I was getting a lot more than I was...imagine my frustration when I poured the bags into a bottle and discovered I only had about 2/3 of what I thought I did.I'm going to try the Lansinoh ones next...these are not worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wastes precious breastmilk","review":"Fits the pump conveniently, but I have lost so much precious breast milk due to leaky bags.

Medela is known for quality products so I thought by paying a little more for these bags would be more beneficial. NOT.

I wouldn't have to transfer from the bottle to the bag and wash the bottles each time I pumped. These bags are horrible.1. The bag isn't sealed during pumping. So if you actually pump close to 5oz (which is what the bag holds) and you move a little to quickly or bend just a little, milk spills out.2. The bags don't close easily. There's no indicator to ensure that the bag has closed properly - so again, there's a risk of spillage.3. The bags don't lay completely flat the way Mother's Own Milk bags or the Lansinoh style bags do. I like to lay the bags flat when freezing so that I can stack the bags in a ziploc to keep them organized by date. These bags freeze in a bulky shape so they can't be stacked neatly.4. The way the bags are designed - it's hard to pour the milk out of the bags into a bottle without spilling.I recommend staying away from these bags."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Estas fundas me parecen buenas porque lo puedo usar con mi extractor directamente.

The plastic of the bag itself is very stiff and tears easily. The seal is awful. Hard to close and leaks. This is especially frustrating when you are trying to use this for convenience at work or to transport milk elsewhere. I haven't even bothered to try and freeze milk in the bags because I was too worried about the bag tipping and leaking all over the freezer. The lansanoh bags are much better. I have even taken the tabs off the medela bags to use on the lansanoh bags. Don't waste your money on these bags. It ends up costing you more in time and lost milk! Plus the Lansanoh bags are cheaper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to zip!","review":"The zip on these bags is extremely picky. You think you've sealed it, run your fingers over it multiple times, but no, it's not sealed and leaks all over. My solution was to squeeze the bag when I thought I had it, just to check. At least a fourth of the time, milk would squirt past the seal. If it isn't reliable for storage, it has no purpose. And really, Medela makes no bags that are a perfect fit for the Freestyle pump? Good grief, it's their top-of-the-line pump.My solution? I switched to theLansinoh 20435 Breastmilk Storage Bags, 25-Count Boxes (Pack of 3), double zip and easy to seal. They freeze perfectly and fit in myThe First Years Milk Storage Organizer. I had to improvise with the bags to connect them to my Freestyle pump anyway so why struggle with the Medela bags?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad-smelling milk","review":"These bags are convenient to pump into, but that's where the pros end. It's difficult to get an accurate measure of how much milk is in the bag unless you measure it and pour it into the bag. Even worse, and the reason I won't buy this brand bag again, is that defrosted milk smells (and presumably tastes) TERRIBLE! It smells like plastic. I didn't feel comfortable feeding it to my child. Anyone who has sat hooked to a breast pump for what amounts to HOURS to later have to throw that milk away can empathize with my disgust over having the storage bags ruin milk. Go with Gerber bags or Lansinoh. I never had this issue with those."},{"rating":"1","title":"Designed by someone who doesn't pump","review":"This new style with the holes is terrible-if you freeze your milk then the milk has to be 100% defrosted/melted to get out of the bag. ie: you want to pour out of the top but DARN! those blasted holes that are supposed to be convenient but end up spilling everywhere! Not to mention the bags even with the new design still only hold 5oz. I just pump into little bottles and pour into a different brand's (much larger) bag. I've been pumping for two years (back to back kids) so have tried them all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than bottles but not by much","review":"I bought this product to limit the number of bottles I would need to purchase. The bags aren't as easy to use as I hoped. I have to press the 'seal' a handful of times to make sure it's completely closed. When the bag is reopened, it's cumbersome to get milk out without tearing the bag completely or spilling the contents. The measuring on the bags is an approximate measurement (as stated on the bags) and that's the last thing you want to think about during the middle of the night when you're either filling the bags or trying to reopen them. Overall, the product is better and cheaper than using bottles but still needs vastly improved in price and functionality."},{"rating":"1","title":"These are OK; Bags are NOT the same ones as pictured","review":"These bags get the job done I guess, but I don't care for them. What really irritates me is that the picture shows the old bags with the stick on strap (which I prefer MUCH more). The older bags were much easier to use. These new ones are hard to pour out of because of the hole (it seems like I'm always spilling milk) and I don't like having two more things to clean. Also, both the new and old bags are 5 oz bags, but for some reason it seems like I can barely fit 5 oz in the news ones. The old ones seemed to have slightly more space. I don't know why Medela would redesign these and make them worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does what its suppose to but messy!","review":"I loved the idea of pumping straight into a storage bag. It ended up being a mess! I'll continue with my old system of pumping into the Medela 80ml tube bottles. If I know I will be freezing the milk I'll pour it from the tube to Lansinoh storage bags. I recommend those bags over the Medelas."},{"rating":"1","title":"lost milk and milk volume measurement inaccurate","review":"My milk leaks from these quite frequently. the zip lock is difficult to seal correctly for some reason. even if you cinch it tightly between your fingers and slide across to seal a few times, it feels sealed even when not. so they are kinda tricky. it would be nice if there was a color change when they are properly sealed, like some food storage bags.The volume of pumped milk in the bag is actually less than what it looks like.

I usually sing the praises of Medela products. However, these pump and save bags are terrible!!!! I have an entire freezer full of stored milk; all of which are sealed in these bags. Now that I am back to work, I have had to defrost several bags at a time...daily. Without question, there is ALWAYS 1 bag that is leaking. The leaks are usually not from the zip top, rather, it has burst along one of the the seams. I only fill the bags with 2-4 ounces, allowing for adequate expansion when the milk freezes; trying to ensure the best I can that the bags won't burst open...and still I am finding leaks.For all of you breastfeeding moms, we all know that breast milk is \\"liquid gold\\" and we have to work SO HARD to produce it. It pains me to see even an ounce of milk wasted in such a manner. Don't waste your money on this!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your money","review":"I find these bags almost impossible to work with. The collar to pump directly into the bags is hard to work with. The holes in the bag for the collar to fit into also make pouring the milk into a bottle a messy fiasco. The best way to pour the milk is to use scissors to cut the top of the bag off. I found that these bags are hard to tell when they are zipped closed too. If you do use these bags don't bother pumping directly into bag just use nipple shield to pour milk into bag after pumping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great for freezing","review":"The bags state \\"safe and long-term breastmilk storage\\" but the milk I pumped and froze last week is nasty. I use most of the milk I pump to make my son's rice cereal as he has started solids. After he refused his food multiple times I tasted the cereal and it was nasty! I pulled another bag out of the freezer from 3 days ago and it smelled and tasted the same with his cereal. Now I use the milk I express in the morning for that day only.

I HATE these bags and I am so upset I went straight to my computer to write a review. I have lost at least an ounce of milk every time I use these bags. They hold so little milk that if you pour just six ounces in your milk will overflow, which is heartbreaking because every ounce is precious. The seal on these is the worst I've seen. VERY difficult and stiff, I have gotten a faulty seal and lost milk when thawing as well! This is incredibly frustrating to a working mother that just wants to provide the best for her baby. Also, these bags do not freeze flat, so they take up a great deal more space in the freezer. The lanisoh or gerber bags are by far more user friendly. Please save your time, sanity, and milk and buy something else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible! Leaks, leaks, and more leaks!","review":"These bags are awful and in my experience, after they are in the fridge, leak more than 50% of the time and, if they put in the freezer, leak more than 80% of the time. Yuck! The Lansinoh bags are wonderful--get those instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT USE THESE","review":"I have been using these for quite some time. For some reason I decided to smell the inside of the bag. There is a strong plastic odor inside the bag. I put some water in one and froze it. Then I thawed it as I would milk for my son. The water absorbed the odor and tasted funny. I have about thirty bags left in the package and am throwing them out. Who knows what chemicals are leaching into the liquid inside. In addition, I noticed that the packaging states \\"Packaged and printed in the USA\\"...but where is the actual plastic used to make the bag made???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost Milk on Defrost","review":"After building up a good store of milk using these bags, I'm devastated that every other one I defrost leaks and the milk is lost all over the counter.

I really dislike the new design with the attachment so you can pump directly into bag. I don't like to pump into the bag because the measurement is inaccurate. So I pump into a bottle then pour it in. The problem is that now there are these huge holes on the sides of the bag above the zipper to attach the thing to hook onto your breastshield, so its impossible to pour milk in without spilling it everywhere! The old ones had perforations to tear off the top part if you don't want to pump directly into bag, not sure why they couldn't do that with this design too. I haven't yet poured any milk out of the bags yet but I'm sure it will be just as messy as getting it into the dang bag. Why doesn't medela first make the measurements more accurate and second try pouring milk in and out of it before they agree a new design works.

I'm not a picky person but after losing my fifth bag of milk I'm fed up. Thank god these bags were given to me and I didn't have to pay the ridiculous ammount they're charging for such a shoddy product. I thought maybe it was me at first, so after the first and second leak I had my partner give it a try on two of the bags I pumped after explaining to him I didn't think I was zipping it right. Out of the two, one of them leaked. Not really sure what the point of having a zipper is if it doesn't close all the way. As a busy working mom that's also going to school full time, I want to cry thinking about all the milk that's been lost because of their terrible design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive, take up a lot of space, messy","review":"I am pumping/ have pumped a lot of milk, and the problem with the Medela bags is manifold. First of all, you can maybe pump 6 oz into the bag MAX. While this might be enough for most people, it often wasn't for me. (Lansinoh and Gerber can hold 10 oz). Secondly, the Medela bags don't freeze flat,which took up a LOT of space in my freezer. (The other two bags can freeze flat, and I just line them up in a shoe box) Medela bags are also very expensive. I don't see the big deal in cleaning a couple of bottles each time I pump. I still have to clean up the shields. Also, it's hard to tell how much milk you have when you pump into a bag. I find it easier and more accurate to pump into a bottle and put EXACTLY what I want into each bag. Finally, I agree with others that this is a pain in the butt to pour. I spilled a lot of milk with Medela bags. Between the Gerber and Lansinoh, the Lansinoh is much stronger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very user-friendly","review":"I thought I'd love to be able to pump directly into these bags, but not so. First of all, logistically you can only pump one side into one bag. So you still have to dirty a bottle, or use two bags at each pumping. And trying to pump into bags means there's no way to do it hands-free, because you have to hold the bags steady.Then there's the measurement markings. They're not accurate. So you have to measure the milk in a bottle before pouring it into the bag, which is an extra step.And the worst part of the bags is that they're not perforated right. There's about 1/2 inch section in the middle that's not perforated at all. So you can tear from both sides, but when you get to the middle if you don't use scissors, there's no telling how far off it'll tear. What a mess!I haven't found a good bag yet, but this is definitely not it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these bags!","review":"I started out pumping and thought I would store all of my milk in Medela's bottles. When I realized how much milk I would need to store, I quickly realized that would cost me an arm and a leg (the bottles run about 20 bucks for 4!) and came upon these little wonders. They are made of a thick polyethylene plastic (safe for long-term storage) and you can't beat the zip-loc style closure compared with other tie bags...those scared me, every drop truly is precious. Granted, they are a bit awkward at first because you are dealing with a container that is much less sturdy than the plastic bottles most women pump into but it works well once you get used to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"These bags leak - terrible seal","review":"I have only been using these bags for about a week, and have had several leaks already. I went to the Amazon reviews to see if it was just me, and I'm glad to know it's not. I agree with what everyone else has said - the zipper seal is terrible. I am a big fan of Medela's other products, which is why I tried these in the first place. I had been using the Lansinoh bags, and will definitely go back to them.

Truly, save your money and buy Laninoh bags. I read the reviews of both, went with Medela at a price premium, thinking that they wouldn't leak, and, what do you know? They leak like crazy. So, if both Lansinoh and Medela bags leak, I'm at least going to start saving money and buying the cheaper storage bag. Medela bags work fine when you pump into them and freeze them; it's just when you actually need to USE them that they fail miserably at their task of \\"storage.\\" I've defrosted several of the bags only to discover -- too late -- hair-line cracks at the bottom of the bags.

This bag holds a maximum of 5 ounces, and is then REALLY difficult to close, whereas the Lansinoh brand holds 6 ounces and closes rather easily. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Medela pumps better than any other pump, but I would go with a different storage bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible design and they leak","review":"THis new design with the holes is ridiculous.

It's the best bag out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Medela BM storage bags are more expensive then other brands and they are not any better.

However, I use them at work to pump into only temporarily. After pumping, I pour the milk into my bottles and these are what I give the baby the next day. I then throw the bags away.I recently purchased a handsfree pumping bra and with the medela bags that attach to my pump. I am now able to work just as I normally would. These bags will leak when used after being frozen, but for my purpose they work great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy these!","review":"These are the worst storage bags! They don't freeze flat. They are had to close and you're not really sure if it is closed all the way and secure. And if you leave them in your freezer for about 3 months or more, they crack. So when I'm defrosting my milk, the bag starts leaking! My milk is basically mixed with water because im defrosting it in a water bath. All my hard work pumping ounce after ounce of milk is just wasted! Get the lansinoh breast milk storage bags. They are so much better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF MONEY","review":"These bags are a waste of money. Yes they can stand on own when filled with milk but takes up to much room in the freezer. Due to the shape of the bag and remaining space when filled to the 5oz line they are unable to lay flat. I would recommend the Lansinoh storage bags they can hold up to 6ozs of milk, lay flat in the freezer and are cheaper than the medela brand.The time you spend trying to be careful when removing the adapter that you pump directly in can be spent just simply transfering the milk from bottle to bag. Save your money and don't buy this item unless you have money to waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy these bags","review":"I am on my way home from a business trip and my cooler is filled with spilled milk.

I will not be buying them again. The measurement is not accurate on the bag, so I started pumping into a bottle then put the milk in the bag.

I started using the Lanisoh bags and prefer them, they are easy to close and are accurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable Zipper Closures","review":"I thought I would love being able to store milk in a bag and lay it flat in the freezer to save room. However, there are a few flaws with this product 1. The ounces it reads while it's in the bag is about one ounce short of what is actually in the bag. To make sure I know exactly how much milk I'm leaving for my baby, I will pump into a bottle and then transfer it to the bag. 2. The ziploc part of the bag does not always close completely, no matter how many times you try, so when you try to lay the bag down, milk gushes out everywhere.

So I pump into the plastic containers and pour into the bags. It's a little tricky to get the milk in and out. The new design of Medela bags are worse - they have holes in the top for a direct-pumping contraption and the milk can pour out the holes as you pour it into the bottle for feeding if you're not careful! My husband cuts the tops off the bag before pouring to avoid the milk coming out the attachment holes as he is pouring it out. Otherwise, I have been very happy with the bags. I've used hundreds already and never had leaking or freezing issues. You do have to do the ziploc up really tight - I go over it 5 times to make sure it's sealed - because otherwise the milk can come out if the bag falls on its side."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Far, So GOOD!","review":"I am a new mom who is trying to build a milk supply before I head back to work. I pump several times a day and have managed to nurse and set aside eight to twelve ounces, thanks to this product. I can freeze the bag standing up, then lay in down to stack the milk in my freezer.

Life is good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I actually like them a lot","review":"I hopped online to re-order these and was surprised by how many people didn't like them. I thought I might just quickly say that I really love them. They are so easy to pump right into, and while the seal can be tricky to get right- once you do it's easy. I think the seal is tricky because it is so sturdy when it's closed, if that makes sense. Great product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"These bags are a pain","review":"I love the Medela Pump and Save bags, but these bags (with the adapter) are terrible. It is extremely difficult to pour the milk out after you defrost it because of the hole at the top (and because the top of the bag is much longer than the previous bags. It is also difficult to pour the milk into the bag if the bag isn't hooked up to the pump. I don't have a Medela pump, but I have liked their breastmilk bags much better than the Lansinoh bags. Maybe they would work better if you have a Medela pump and can hook the bag right up to the pump - though the accuracy of the amount on the bags has never been quite right. Either way, I do not recommend these bags and am hoping Medela continues to offer the bags that don't include the adapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea in theory","review":"These bags are a nice idea in theory but have many flaws:1) The measurement is only approximate, which if you're a pumping mom, is annoying.2) The zipper-closure is AWFUL. I hurt my fingers nearly every time I try to close each bag and it is nearly impossible to squeeze the extra air out of the bag before closing. Even when closed all the way, milk can still leak most of the time.3) The bags are difficult to get on and off the adapter. It takes twisting and turning just the right way and the first time I tried, I broke a bag.4) They are FAR too expensive to be this problematic.Do yourself a favor and just stick to the Lansinoh bags...they are the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what is pictured","review":"The item pictured is the Medela pump and save breastmilk bags with the yellow adhesive going over the top. The item you will receive is the bags with the adapters. Having used the bags with the adhesive before I quickly ordered thinking what I would get is what is pictured. I have yet to use the bags with the adapters to compare. My only concern so far is that the adapters will hold the weight and it is another piece to clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Milk smelled horrible after defrosting","review":"I stored some in the freezer for when I go back to work. After only two weeks in the freezer, I defrosted one to see how easily things would go, needless to say, after warming it up, the smell was horrific. I had some Lanisoh bags and I defrosted one of those, much better. If you end up with this box, I would not suggest freezing, store in the fridge with the four day rule then toss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy these under any circumstances","review":"These are the worst possible version of this product available.

I only bought them because they say you can pump directly into them. Well, it's not that easy to do that. I tried it once and didn't like it. I prefer to just pump into a bottle and then pour it into the bags. It's so much easier. And for just plain milk storage the bags didn't seal well so they leaked. Also, I like to store my milk flat so they defrost faster. These bags don't lay flat. I have switched to Dr. Brown's bags. They are much better.

Medela bags are a great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money....","review":"These are not my favorite. I find them very awkward to use. Several times, I have had the milk spill out of the bag while pumping. I have been very careful in attaching them, but depending on how I sitting, the bag tends to fold and then the milk spills. I usually just pump in the bottle and pour into the bag to freeze. I also find it hard to close them without having milk gush out. They also don't lie flat in the freezer making them hard to stack. I will not be buying this type of bag again.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product NOT as stated","review":"Product sent to me was not the product described or pictured: I was REALLY excited when I saw the product description and picture showing the Medela bags with the convenient strapping mechanism. I've been a long-time Medela user and absolutely loved the old bags with the strap that goes over the breast shield. The new version has an adapter that allows you to hook the bag over and pump directly in to it, but I don't really care for that version. They don't seal as well, hold as much, and are difficult to pour without spilling. I wanted the old-style bag.I was really bummed when I had this delivered only to find out it's really the new version with the adapters.

However, I grabbed these bags because I pump at work and being able to pump directly into bags would save the time. I was horribly wrong. Cleaning up spilled milk takes longer than transferring to bags from bottles. These are really awkward to use if you only have two hands (which I'm pretty sure most, if not all nursing moms do). The seals are really finicky and I'm always scared the bags are going to bust open in my pump bag on the way home from work. I've also had issues with the holes for the attachment \\"hooks\\" ripping. Add in the limited space for milk (5 oz as opposed to Lansinoh's 6oz bags with room to spare) and the milk that gets above the zipper seal while you're pumping (even with a Pump In Style), and these are just a bad product.

They work fine when you're pumping, but they are hard to close so that all of the air gets out of them. The Lansinoh bags are much easier in this regard, and have a double seal at the top. The pump and save bags don't lie flat in the freezer, so they take up much more space. And they're designed terribly in terms of pouring the defrosted milk out of the bag - you have to pour along the side seam, but because the top is curved, you lose some of the milk as you're pouring. As a result, they don't save any time or clean up hassle. I find it easier to pump into bottles and use the Lansinoh bags."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good effort","review":"This is a wonderful effort by a young writer. When I purchased this novel to use for my thesis on adolescent lit, I didn't realize it was published by a vanity publisher (or I most certainly would not have bought it). The first few pages were well written and edited, but then the punctuation and grammar went down hill. Weinstein does a great job of showing how homophobia has infiltrated America's middle schools. The story was interesting, yet incomplete. I understand this is part of a trilogy or series, but it really is not finished--there's far too much of a cliff hanger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product!","review":"These organza bags from Raina's Garden Creations are perfect - just as good as the ones available at all the party supply shops in my city, and only half the price (came out to $0.24 per bag including expedited shipping whereas the party supply shops charge $0.40 - $0.50). I was nervous with this order because I had seen reviews for other online suppliers of organza bags stating that there are often tags that must be laboriously cut out of every bag. Not so with these lovely items . . . they are ready to be filled with wedding favor treats."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely poor as far as sci-fi goes!","review":"I have to agree with some of the previous reviews for this book. The book's opening chapter is good, and draws you into the plot. But as soon as you hit the second chapter, Hartmann loses it. He launches into a completely unnecessary and monotonous love triangle, which only manages to drag out the plot and make you want to reach into the thing and grab the protagonist's neck. It's almost completely unbearable. I truly had to do some serious struggling to get through this novel, and as long as I don't have to come across another Hartmann novel ever again, I'll be a happy man. Please don't waste your time and money on this piece of garbage. This book has two main parts, but neither one lives up to it. So, if you want good sci-fi, read Greg Bear or James Alan Gardner. And if you want a good romance, read something by Danielle Steel or \\"Bag of Bones\\" by Stephen King."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money or your time","review":"I read prose for the enjoyment of the reading. I read every word and I don't skip to the end to find out how the story comes out. This book was a singular exception. Boring, at least 3 times too long, more concerned with a pointless love triangle than with Mars. I only finished it by skimming, stopping every four or five pages to read the few paragraphs necessary to follow what little plot there was. Unless you're into existential philosopy, the ending is a total joke. The descriptions of Mars surface geology are interesting, but that's about it. Stephen King could probably turned this into a good short story."},{"rating":"1","title":"400 + pages of nothingness","review":"I just finished this book. Honestly, it was the worst book I've ever read. Absolutely nothing happens. The character development somehow manages to stay flat even as the author writes ream after ream. The only redeeming aspect (which is why it deserves one star) is the perspective it provides on the social development of makind (and human romantic relationships) in the context of liberating our socio-biological history. Beyond that the book is a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"An overratedexercise in intellectual wheel spinning.","review":"I had great hopes for this book when I ordered it but it was avast disappointment. Three quarters of the novel is a tedious buildup. Finally, after the love triangles and pointless maunderings on human nature the reader feels that he has arrived at the meat of the story only to reach the end crying: \\"Where's the beef?\\" The ending is unsatisfying, to say the least. Maybe Arthur Clarke liked it because it is a direct steal from 'The Sentinel' only less upbeat. The author seems to have written the ending in the midst of a fit of depression."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of potential, not much payoff...","review":"Hartmann has a nice, comfortable prose-style that makes for a relaxed, enjoyable read; unfortunately, though, this story never really takes off. The mystery is developed nicely (if a bit too slowly), but doesn't have quite enough of a payoff. A banal love triangle slows things down unnecessarily, while many of the characters remain mere thumbnail sketches, without much life breathed into them. What really prevents the tale from working, however, is Hartmann's almost complete lack of description of the Martian landscape, of the human habitats, of the characters, etc. In a tale like this, if the author's storytelling doesn't make you feel as though you're on an alien world, he isn't doing his job. I read tales set on Mars in order to be transported there, to have the planet brought to life for me. This tale didn't really even try to do that. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best Goosebumps out there","review":"I bought this for my 2 daughters (3 & 7) who borrowed a goosebumps video from a friend and loved it. We bought 3 goosebumps episodes based on the reviews (Chillogy, Deep Trouble, Scary House). Chillogy was terrible. It was neither scary (in the goosebumps way) nor very interesting. It was really more of a super-weak attempt at a twilight zone episode for kids that I would guess was done to have enough episodes for a season. The other two Goosebumps were exactly what we expected. They were scary in a kid-friendly way and had stories that kept the kids engaged. I would highly recommend Deep Trouble & Scary House for younger kids. If you really want to check out Chillogy, rent it before buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Post Apocalypse Nightmare","review":"This film is not for everyone. It explores some of the darker elements never dealt with in most disaster films. Quite a few people seem to have missed the point that it's a film about how people react during a crisis. There really are no cinematic heroes present (a refreshing change from the cliched filled majority of these movies) and the overall situation is given the right sense of dread. These people are alone, trapped in a basement and forced to deal with one another. The fact that some have been driven insane by what happened adds to the tension. Well worth checking out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shocking, but ultimately unsatisfying","review":"*SPOILERS*This movie centers around despairing situations and how a group of people face these challenges. It sounds really good on paper to me, but this movie was too depressing for me. There was some sort of plot, but it did not flow or connect together, which really left me unsatisfied at the end of the movie. It's just scenes and scenes of depressing material that I could have done without. I'm not against gore, horror, suspense, and depressing human conditions, but I really did not need to watch two hours of it and end up getting nothing from this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste!","review":"Don't even waste your time viewing the trailer.

It is marketed as a horror story, but I think a drama would be a better description.What it is, is an unrelated small group of people manage to get in time into an atomic bomb shelter during a nuclear blast. The original plan is to wait out the nuclear blast. However, they get locked in by some scavengers and more importantly a few start to go crazy. I hope it is not a real image of people as I like to think in times of extreme danger people come together and do not go crazy like, for example, miners trapped in a mine or inmates in German Death camps. Overall, I think the story starts off very good, half way I was really enjoying it, but then it drifted off into pointlessness.The characterizations itself are reasonable. The acting is good.The filming and special effects are reasonable for such a movie.I would, however, not see it again nor do I recommend it, mainly because I do not like the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull boring-- fell asleep","review":"I don't understand all the critic reviews on this movie. It was so boring that I fell asleep on it. A few people locked in a bunker doesn't excite not to mention the characters were dull and unbelievable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Well Done!","review":"I rented this movie not knowing entirely what to expect, but the premise sounded real interesting. The Divide was played out with the most outstanding acting that I've seen in a long time. It held my attention from the beginning to the end, and the director should win some kind of award for the way he perceives a group of people slowly slipping into insanity.I would have given it 5 stars instead of 4, if it weren't for a couple of scenes that wasn't really called for.All in all, I don't think I wasted my rental fee one bit...for that is how I rate my movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way better than I expected .....","review":"I ordered this BD and got it very quickly at a great price !

It's really just one depravity after the next, each one topping the last. You never find out why anything is occurring either. I like post apocalyptic movies, but this was a total disappointment. If you like this sort of thing, watch the first 5 minutes and then the last 5 minutes, just to get the feeling of the atmosphere. Everything in between really doesn't have much to do with it except for a bunch of people going nuts because they can't cope. Remember that guy from Terminator, the one who was sent back in time to be protect Sarah Connor? Yeah he's in it too. He must have needed to eat that week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Went too far","review":"We were enjoying this movie for about the first 45 minutes and then it just took a drastic turn and become a heaping pile of unrealistic and sadistic crap. It wasn't about surviving, it was about S&M, rape, torture and it went too far. It ruined what until then was a decent movie. Not award material, but still interesting. What was Rosanna Arquette thinking when she took this role? Is she that hard up for cash that she would take a degrading role like this? Slight spoiler regarding her role...her daughter gets taken and how does she respond instead of trying to get her back? Starts rotating on some man meat and willingly gets abused and no one does anything to stop it. If you, like us, got this because you like post-apocalyptic type movies, you'll be disappointed in this one because that is very little of the story line. Almost the entire movie takes place in one bunker-type location and there is no focus on survival besides rationing water and can goods."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blu-ray Release: 'The Divide'","review":"If you love \\"end-of-the-world\\" films, \\"The Divide DVD + Blu-ray Combo Pack\\" will be a treat.

Michael Biehn also had to have his good looks turned into a grizzled mess. This could have been a very different movie, if you ladies know what I mean hehe. Even the wimpy foreign guy was pleasing to the eye when he wasn't crying like a lost puppy. Other than the eye candy, it was depressing, dark, and seemed meaningless. Nothing original or creative, just the standard rape-to-death sicko fantasy world for guys that want society to end. This movie played like someone gave a basic outline and the rest was impromptu, without anyone knowing or caring how it ends or any of the details along the way. The characters were all very flawed or very weak, or both.

I for one enjoyed it because I knew what to expect being that this is a movie about the apocalypse. The reviewers who gave this low scores state that it is a depressing movie without hope or redeeming value. It is true the movie has little to no hope in it, and it is a descent of the rational into madness. What else would you expect when a group of people lock themselves in a building basement after nuclear bombs go off? You will enjoy this movie if you go into it expecting to be disgusted and wanting to see a raw, no holds barred portrayal of humanity at its worst.

I love witnessing a creative team's vision come to life on the screen as they tackle the complexities of contemporary humans in futuristic, lawless societies.However, The Divide just didn't do it for me. It focuses on what happens when people are locked in a small space together and lacks nuance in that treatment. It reminded me more of a hatchet horror film than the psychological thriller it wants to be. The Divide intentionally feels claustrophobic, but unfortunately it's equally cramped in its ability to challenge the viewer.This movie should have been a short, 30-minute film focusing on fewer, more sympathetic characters. Instead it's a long mess with nothing to grab on to. (Felt like one star, but giving it two for the acting.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible film - the worst one I have ever seen","review":"I agree with the reviewer, who says that there is no redeeming value to this movie. I would give it zero stars, if possible. I have also collected many movies of all types, over 3,000, and have quite a strong stomach. But I don't know how the actors were even induced to play out such depravity. I was sickened and only finished watching (fast forwarding through many parts), because I was curious to find out what happened in the end -- which was also pointless, I might add. I suppose if there is one lesson we can learn from this, it's the horror humans are capable of unleashing on each other under certain circumstances. We shouldn't, for example, say that things like the Holocaust can't happen, as some ignorantly do. But truly, as far as this film goes, I would have to say worthless is the best word to describe it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing and Sad!","review":"I feel that this movie is very DISTURBING!

The actors/actresses really impressed me with what they had to work with.It starts literally with the apocolypse and your general group of survivors including the super of the apartment complex Michael Biehn all racing down the stairs to take cover in the basement of their apartment building. There are so many different personalities and this movie really gets down to the nitty gritty of how they felt and the madness that creeps up on them in many forms...from torture, to violence, and very disturbing sex scenes with Rosanna Arquette as the woman being used by several of the men. I was totally hooked from the start and its a movie that you either love it or hate it, I loved it. Its worth a rent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Post-Apocalyptic Porn","review":"The basic idea of this film is that if dozen strangers are trapped in a basement following a nuclear strike, they'll turn into raving sexual monsters. This thing is as close to a snuff film as it gets, with Roseann Arquette submitting herself to one of the most degrading roles ever filmed. I'm no prude, by a long shot, but if someone were to tell me they watched this movie twice, I'd take out a restraining order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promising concept but poorly made film","review":"Take a nuclear attack, add the scared residents of an apartment building. Lock them in a basement and add paranoia, sex and lots of violence and you have The Divide. I liked the idea of this film and thought it had a lot of promise. Unfortunately that is not the film we have here. There seems to be no point or reason to this film. Things seem to happen just to happen. Not to further the story. And there is not a likeable character in this film. I suggest skipping this film and watching something better like Take Shelter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"This movie is a complete waste of time. Humans can be dark, but a real life scenario wouldn't play out like this. Everyone that didn't give this film one star is misguided or maybe follows Tom Cruise's religion. Idiotas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too good","review":"This movie starts OK, and gets a little better as things go on to a point. Then it's obvious the writer had no idea what to do after that and then the movie devolves into your stereo typical survivor horror story. Why people stand around letting one or two others rape and torture when they can just subdue the crazy ones makes no sense. I assume it was the Directors failed attempt to shock the audience instead of answering questions about the original attackers of the City."},{"rating":"1","title":"disgusting","review":"I undestand the message of helplessnes, human depravity and nature, but the film carried it too far, too unrealistic to the point of beint very disgusting. I am throwing the video away. some of the actions taken by the actors was unrealistic, even considering human depravity. It had no social redeeming value whatsoever. I am a movie collector and have some sense of realism, social values and human nature, but this film ultimately has no value to be transmitted to the viewer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"Thought this would be about nuclear devestation or planning or something interesting. Instead turned in to a lot of crazy people (even before the traumatic event occured) acting out weird issues. Became very lower social class (drugs, rape etc)."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a very disturbing but well done movie","review":"From the perspective of what the produces wanted to convey I think this movie did it. It certainly portrayed what might happen in a post nuclear situation. I found it very disturbing and I am sure that is what it was meant to be. The acting was well done and the dialog realistic. I can only say that it is not for the faint at heart. I am not a fan of this type movie because they seem to be very depressing and this was but it kept my interest nonetheless. I wanted to turn it off yet I didn't. If you are someone that likes really intense apocalyptic movies this one is a good one to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for everyone but a gritty movie","review":"I only rented this movie because it was $1 somewhere else, but much to my surprise I ended up liking it.Now, you are definitely not going to get any warm and fuzzy feelings while watching this film. Parts of it are dark and very sad, but it's not gory. Oh bad stuff does happen, but at least the movie does not show every gruesome detail. In fact, I'm not sure why this film is categorized as \\"horror.\\" Drama or sci-fi drama would be more fitting.There are a few twists and turns that I definitely did not expect, which made the plot interesting. While there are several holes in the story and I found myself wanting to wring the neck of a few of the characters, the film is not simply a remake of something we've seen before. It won't win any oscars, but it's a great psychological thriller. A sort of Lord of the Flies in the aftermath of an undefined attack that takes place in the basement apartment of a crazy building supervisor.The scenario makes for a pretty good flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Depraved Post-Apocalyptic Story","review":"I won't rehash the plot. I thought the story was very believable. I can understand people going insane under those circumstances. The great divide seems to be between people who hated and loved this movie. I'm on the fence. Wish I could give it two ratings. 5 stars for the acting which was top notch and a lesser rating for the depressing plot which left a few glaring holes--for me. I'm sure the idea was to create the same fear and uncertainty in the audience as in the characters in the movie. It succeeded in doing that, but I would have liked to know a little more about the enemy. 4 stars for a thought-provoking look at the break down of desperate people."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"This film shows the dark side of human behavior without restraint and humanity. For mere voyeurism and violence sake, I see no entertainment value or enjoyment watching women getting raped and men displaying the \\"might is right\\" justification at any costs. How long does capitivity take for some to butcher and mutilate corpses before justifying cannibalism? How long does being confined with a group of strangers make humans more dangerous to each other before we realize maybe surviving was a bad idea? In any case, I found myself wanting these people to die if these people are whats left of the human race. It was a waste of time watching and money renting this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hecks going on?","review":"OK,it is a great idea for a movie but it ends and your asking yourself \\"what the heck?\\"There is no explanation for anything thats going on.Who was the government agency?,Why were they taking the children?Too many situations with to many unanswered questions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy","review":"I watched this movie when it first arrived. Really didn't know anything about it except what I had read in reviews. Movie did not make any sense to me. I know it will get pretty ugly when and if something goes wrong in our country ( EMP, Nuclear Attack, etc) but this one was way over the top. This movie was not believable in any way, the characters were all over the place in personalities and actions. I would not waste my money. Heck, you can even have my copy....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grim","review":"This is one of the grimmest movies that I have ever seen. It starts out bad and only gets worse as time goes by. If you ever thought that the end of the world might not seem so bad, watch this and you will save the last round for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I did not buy this thru Amazon. I should have come here first though to see what the reviews were. I had hoped for a film about the apocolypse, but this one is more of porn and violence than anything else. There is a definite decline into madness by each character represented in this tale with absolutely no hope of a future. Gives one the sense of such hopelessness that if this ever occurs, one would be better off killing oneself, immediately, rather than going through any length of survival."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Divide - a dark movie","review":"The Divide is a dark emotion packed movie. Not much on sets but heavy on good acting. I thought this moviewas much more realistic than allot of other post-apocolyptic movies. No happy ending and no ray of hopefulson shine. A would call it a groups journey into madness. I recommend this to someone who likes a dark edgystory that doesnt mind a sad hopeless ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful stupid pointless movie to waste your time","review":"I can't really thing of any aspect of this movie that is worthy of positive note. I love the end of the world kind of movies, and since Michael Biehn (sp?) is in this movie I thought it might be fun to watch ... I actually rented it online. What a dog of a movie. If you want to see something with the idea of this movie, watch \\"Lord Of The Flies\\" because that is all that happens here, the people in the movie degenerate into rapists, murderers, insanity - not to mention stupid. This is already many multiples more words than this piece of garbage deserves .... 1/5 - AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suck It","review":"Pure disgusting. One of the worst movies of all time. If you are demented and want to puke, this movie is for you. Wish I didn't even have to give it a star, but amazon makes ya! Thee one and only good thing about this film was the last song played while the credits were rolling. Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait until its plays on TV...","review":"I should have listened to the other reviews. According to IMDB it only made over $20,000, how is that possible? Well if you watch this movie you will understand why. Watch it on HBO or paid cable. I don't recommned this movie to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Collection of Readings","review":"There are a few useful nuggets in this book, but by and large it is a collection of disconnected articles, papers, and such produced by the ICI, the SEC, and other authors. It resembles a book of readings assembled by a lazy professor for his college course (which it actually is). One could get most of the value found in this collection simply by pulling the articles from the SEC and ICI web sites, at a much lower cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"More or less worthless","review":"If you're looking to read a Fidelity infomercial, buy this.

This book is the one-eyed man in the land of the blind... if someone writes an alternative, this book will move to the dustbin. It is nothing but a cut and paste effort. Less than 10% of the content came from Pozen's word processor; the remainder was constructed with a Xerox machine and an exacto knife. And it is priced like an expensive textbook. A reader who is interested in this industry would be better off with an internet search engine and a few copies of Kiplinger's Mutual Funds magazine."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book has been superseded","review":"If you're interested what this book covers, there is a new book you should consider. Gremillion's book \\"A Purely American Invention: the U.S. Mutual Fund Industry\\" is several years newer, and much better written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry as dust and just as entertaining","review":"You don't buy a mutual fund book expecting excitement, but this book is dull even for a text. It's a series of disjointed lectures and pieces that, cobbled together, might have made for an interesting class when you could interact with the author. In this format, it's dry and boring. It's certainly not for the average guy looking to learn about funds and the fund business (it talks over that person's head), but it's little more than a refresher for anyone who is knowledgeable about funds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. Rhodes writes beautiful poetry as well as a great story!","review":"Yes, this is a really good story about the horrors of war and loss and death and life lived with courage and love. But, the real joy for me was the Christ figure in the character of Grey Hampton. The Journal writings from the character of Grey Hampton are filled with the cycles of place and time,coupled with the ebb and flow of human fortunes. Certainly a book that is worth reading and passing on to others. A book that is gifted to honor life by the main characters living fully, loving wastefully, and daring to be all that each of them had the capacity to be. Thankyou Mr Rhodes"},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling reading","review":"This book is both informative and entertaining.The sheer amount of research and effort that Dave Pelz has put into the project gives tremendous credibility to his findings.One disappointment is that I am yet to find anyone who is prepared to build the teaching/training aids that I believe are essential if the reader is to get the most out of the book. Notwithstanding this I believe the book is well worth the investment.The only other criticism I have relates to the percentage of space devoted to what I would call the mechanics of making consistent contact as compared to how to read greens. I would have liked more information on reading the slope, pace and level of greens.I have no hesitation in recommending the book to golfers who believe their putting can do with a helping hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Put like the Pros and the short game bible","review":"2 Top Books, delivered very quickly and in excellent condition.

I expected as much from this book. Unfortunately most of the practice methods in this book require using Pelz' special practice equipment and therefore aren't very helpful unless you have these items. There is some interesting info on the lack of consistency in how a golf ball rolls, but other than that I didn't get much out of this book. I certainly didn't need to read this to know that taking several hundred practice putts a week will make you a better putter, and that is the bottom line."},{"rating":"2","title":"poetic revolutionary","review":"This is a fascinating little book and a real eye-opener. Everybody knows Ho Chi Minh was the father of modern Viet Nam and one of the great revolutionaries of the last century and one of the very few who wasn't a total monster. But I don't think many people know that he was also a pretty good poet, at least judging from the translations in this volume, which are beautifully rendered into fixed rhyme and meter. Ho wrote these poems in Chinese when he was a prisoner during World War II. I read a free verse translation of Ho's Prison Diary a long time ago but it was awfully prosaic. These translations are not only poetic but showcase Ho's poetic and diplomatic skills and convey a vivid sense of his personality and the context in which he was writing. The translator has only translated half the poems in The Prison Diary, but he more than makes up for this loss with an introduction that is as entertaining as it is informative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Birding Across America","review":"The past and present co-mingle as Scott Weidensaul more or less follows the tracks of Peterson and Fisher's 1950s bird species race across America.

I've been hanging on to my original CD from 1988 waiting for a remaster. My 1988 Faith CD was a \\"limited edition\\" because it has the album art printed right on the CD! (something that was not done back in 1988).The remastering was done quite well and the bonus CD is great! It would have been nice if they had included the DJ mix of \\"I Want Your Sex\\" part one. It started with the drumbeat instead of the synth. It is annoying that parts one and two on the CD are grouped together as one track. By adding the DJ version of \\"Sex,\\" it would have finally solved that problem.This by far is one of the best pop album of the eighties and I highly recommend it. It would have got 5 stars if they included that one extra track."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is why George Michael is considered a music genius","review":"This album was ahead of its time when it was released and considering that only one person could make such diverse and innovative music one necessarily have to conclude that George Michael's talent is a privileged one.

A singular person faced with a responsibility for mankind that she could not have imagined in a million years. God has touched Mikaya and in doing so has chosen her to do his work..This is a great book. I started reading it imagining that I was in for 344 pages of religious mumbo jumbo but discovered very quickly that nothing could have been farther from the truth. The writing style is friendly and colorful and interesting. Not since Stephen King have I read a book so richly descriptive. I felt like I knew Mikayla personally.

Yes, the multitap does succesfully read all four controllers and the memory card; it does act and do its function perfectly... However, at the same time, it completely degrades the audio quality; audio is at a low volume is full of static. Even more so, I can not even turn on my PS2two with this multitap plugged in, the PS2two will turn on and then immediately turn itself off within a second. I have never been happy with any Pelican products, but I was forced to buy this one since Gamestop refuses to carry the official Sony line of adaptors. It is my feeling that Pelican did not test this product for PS2twos, they simply changed the design a bit so that it fit into the PS2two controller/memory port and called it a day.

The PStwo either doesn't turn on at all, or it stays on, doesn't turn off, and doesn't do anything- no game load, no system browser, *nothing*.It looks like Pelican has discontinued the product ( I couldn't find it on their website ), and there is a clear reason.

Fans of Reeves, and the genre, may object most to the pan-and-scan versions of these movies presented here. Bad prints, too, and this is a shame, because the color photography and widescreen were a huge part of the appeal of these amiably modest spectacles.

The company profiles are 2-3 sentences no matter whether it is the multi-billion Carnival Cruises or Amazon Delta Steam Boat.Regarding \\"New Ships\\" since 2001 all cruise ships listed in her book carry \\"Unknown Name\\". At least after I paid more than \\"Working on Cruise Ships\\" and \\"How to get a job with a cruise line\\", I expected fresh and relevant information.

Set in 1950 Los Angeles, a brutal murder sets private eye Victor Deamis, in a race to discover the secrets of a smuggled ancient Chinese statue before he is swallowed up in a political maelstorm involving the CIA, the Chinese nationalists led by Chiang Kai Shek, the newly formed communist regime of Mao Tse-Tung and a Chinese gang called the Benevolent Tiger Triad.Each character, no matter how incidental, is vividly and completely drawn. Deamis is a fascinating protagonist, burdened with a world weary sarcasm that covers a sensitive and noble heart.Figure on missing some sleep - this one is un-put-down-able right up to the last page. I only hope to see more of Victor Deamis in the future - his story is just beginning in this exciting first outing."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books in the House of Winslow series","review":"THE WHITE HUNTER captured my interest from the first chapter and never let up. The characters were well-written with distinct personalities. I was particularly impressed with how Mr. Morris shows God at work in the lives of people who are so different, and yet He can use each one. Mr. Morris offers insights into the lives of missionaries and captures the frustrations and dangers they face in Africa. Also, he once again has a great hero in John Winslow, the white hunter. The section of the book where Annie Winslow and Jeanine Quintana are on the Titanic was especially interesting. I have read all of the books in the Winslow series, and this is one on the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, well written, interesting","review":"Gilbert Morris has taken an interesting turn in this series by taking several of his characters to Africa as missionaries. I found the plot interesting and the characters realistic enough to even be mad at them when they were hard headed. It had new experiences and was well done. I recommend starting somewhere earlier in the series, but this is one of those books that you can pick up without reading the prequels and still get stuff out of it. Well done again Mr. Morris!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many characters, too little development","review":"This title of this book is misleading in that the titular character is absent for the majority of the book, and his relationship with the main female character remains a mystery despite hints. Obviously something happened between the two of them, but it is never explained. Annie seems like a caricature, as does Jeanine. There are just too many questions in this book, like Annie's mystery illness that comes and goes and seems simply like a handy plot device. I was disappointed with this entry in the House of Winslow series."},{"rating":"2","title":"New discovery of an older book.","review":"I just ordered this book but only today my piano teacher handed me her Easy Way To Play and after a brief lesson I was hooked.

This one tells of her mother's battle with ovarian cancer.As any daughter would want to do for her mother, this book plays a magnificent, loving tribute to a dying woman. However, I just could not get into the book. Maybe it was because I, too, have cancer (breast cancer,) but this book to me was depressing, long-winded and did not hold my interest. It was a chore to flip each page. The story could have been told in a few chapters. While the events are, without doubt, signicant to the family, they were rather predictable and uneventful to the reader. I respect the author's compassion for her dying mother, but the book did not stand out as a literary work of art."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"\\"Last Wish\\" is the true story of the author, Betty Rollin's mother, a health concerned and loving woman in her mid seventies.

A book titled \\"Healing Tonics\\" gives you the impression that it's all about healing drinks containing herbs, fresh fruit & vegetables. Unfortunately some recipes contain meat (chicken, oysters) and some other products that I don't believe contribute to a healthful life in any way (butter, etc). Although those items were not in the author's recipes, they were in recipes from her contributors (other herbalists).

It is worth noting that the book begins with lengthy forwards and prefaces which I found wordy, ponderous, and a bit moralistic. I began to fear the book would be the same. Not so! when you finally get to chapter one, the pace picks up and the tone and diction become lighter and much friendlier to a high-school level of reader. Far from being moralistic, the author deals with a variety of real issues that young people have to face, and does it in a frank, sensible, easygoing and very constructive fashion. The book should be a help and a comfort to many in its target audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Infomative","review":"I like this book and so does my family.

With so many women saints, there really is no excuse for padding the pages with women who are not even Blesseds like Dorothy Day.Some people might find women like Day inspiring but she is not a saint. I think it is a bit presumptuous for the author to substitute her own judgment of who is a saint for that of the Church. Until the Church has declared a woman a Blessed or a Saint she should not be in a book like this. Especially, when the book includes prayers of intercession from the named \\"saint.\\" The person might be in purgatory not heaven.

Many must love him, including myself. Still, he is in big trouble if this mess of a movie is what happens when he's a main character. Maybe like Paul Lynde, he really has to be to the sides and not at the front of the line.Let me mention just one scene that illustrates the silliness of this film. Trejo's character takes a female intern hostage as he flees a hospital. You hear all this female screaming and pleading, but the actress' mouth never moves while she is being hauled away. Trejo is walking slowly with an unwilling hostage yet the police are unable to catch up with him. Trejo has been in prison for years, yet he can shoot effectively with a hostage in one hand and the police get hit with his bullets left and right and do fake \\"I'm shot!\\" movements all over.A hardcore Trejo fan may want to see this, but anyone else probably won't be able to stomach it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Message NEEDS TO BE HEARD TODAY!","review":"I personally love Touched by an Angel and the message it brings....

As far as cost goes, I will not fall for the trick of paying full price for 1/2 a season after the first 2 seasons were released all in one for the same price. I remember wanting a song from Celine Dion and the company would only print the disk when they had enough advance orders. You would think that these companies would want to keep happy customers in these down times.

It seems that this prejudice existed even with the release of Season 1. Why would Season 1 be released with the Season 9 finale if not to briefly open and close the door with one release. The Season 9 finale was an inspiration but that was due to the inspiring episodes it was based on, from Seasons 1 through 9, not Seasons 1-4. I am undecided whether I will purchase this excuse to tantalize the fans and still not satisfy the fans. Apparently there is something afoot when profits are secondary to what appears to be at best politically correctness or at worst, a spiritual darkness, which is driving this conscious effort to withhold the remaining seasons. I am not saying this in a vacuum.

If they want to make money then they should offer the addition seasons which they lead the public to believe would happen. If the cost of producing the seasons was to much for them to spend then I don't know why they didn't sell the rights which several other tv shows have been done that way. I really believe it is a mistake for the public to buy these \\"Collection Specials\\". This is not for the publics benefit but theirs. Please don't support them.

Instead, he serves up a large dose of contempt and putdowns, and his own subtle and not-so-subtle hostility for his subject. The more I read, the angrier I got, until I decided this book was not worth finishing. It's far more revealing of the author's mental and emotional state than of Danny Kaye. For me, the book is an insult, not just to Danny Kaye, but to the reader as well. Danny Kaye certainly deserves a careful in-depth accurate, definitive biography. Instead, this book appears to be an intentional character assassination piece.

I was very surprised by the overexplicit display of antipathy towards Kaye and his wife Sylvia Fine, not to mention the amount of unsubstantiated theories and conclusions that this book holds.I hope that some day someone will write the kind of book that an entertainer of Danny Kaye's magnitude deserves.

The stories also carry heavy political, racial, and social ideas that leave the reader with much to ponder.At first I had some misgivings about the title; I thought the book would be about little men from Mars getting their freak on. But the book is much more than that. In my opinion, alien in this case means foreign as opposed to extra-terrestrial. Washington presents several unique and open-minded ideas about the future and sexuality. This book will arouse you both sexually and mentally.

While the book did introduce me to variants of the system I had never heard of, I don't know how much of the history is fact, fiction, or faction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring to read.","review":"I was so excited to received my copy of Complete Wing Chun. After reading through a couple of chapters, I was dissapointed. Most of the materials are already in the internet. I expected more materials, more pictures, etc. Example What is unique in Yuen Kay San's Wing Chun? In Pan Nam's, etc. A comparison between the various types of Wing Chun will be very helpfull. Differences in stances, footworks, techniques, and drills. I expected more in the format of GM William Cheung's book \\"Comparison of JKD and Wing Chun\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book lacks depth and understanding","review":"I was very disappointed after buying this book, although well presented it lacked any real technical understanding and concentrated mostly on history, it was not the real wing chun."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is confusing at best and misleading at worst.","review":"This book's purpose is confusing. It is not a complete guide to Wing Chun, but focuses on obscure and marginal branches and instructors. The most influential and authentic teachers are either not mentioned or given short shrift. The authors promote themselves as experts, asserting their authority in the unattributed assertions and overgeneralizations. No proper critical appraisal of different schools or approaches is given; as if each school discussed gave their students the same benefits, which they do not. Like many of the highlighted \\"teachers,\\" the book is too commercial without any depth. Its simple premise is \\"It's all Wing Chun,\\" as if one branch and another are interchangable despite the shortcomings of these minor offshoots. Do not waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A unique attempt to look beyond myth to historical reality","review":"One suspects that the title may have been forced upon the authors by a publisher with a series of \\"The Complete ...\\" martial arts books. Not truly complete in that it is not an instructional manual, this book is a unique historical effort to get beyond the legends and myths and explore the true origins of Wing Chun and its many branches. It has much to offer the student who is not afraid to think for himself and much to offend the student who is afraid to question what he was told that he must accept as tradition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice","review":"This book differs from other Martial Arts books along the lines of \\"Technique, Application\\" etc. The book details different lineages of Wing Chun, there history, how they differ, etc. It is more of a book not to improve your fighting but rather to learn about how Wing Chun evolved so differently."},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste of space on your shelf","review":"If you have lots of spare change and a lot of space to waste on your shelf then you might buy this book.

The writing on the Yip Man chapter is based on the author's biased opinion rather than objective information.

Their statement appears to be made out of respect for the various schools. However, by ignorng the obvious differences in curricula and by generalizing the similarities of the three main forms, they are now ready to extol their practiced styles toward the end of their text -- the Yip Man and Yuen Kay-Shan styles (p118-120.) These two styles have been subtly positioned to be the standard of reference for comparative studies. Hence the differences found in other Wing Chun styles are ascribed to influences from non Wing Chun kung fu."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good work on a hard subject to investigate.","review":"I really liked this book and I enjoyed reading it. Obviously this book is not a \\"How to\\" book since the title says it's about history and tradition. It's hard to go back in time and see the past in focus without good documentation on the Chinese part due to secrecy. Nonetheless this book was very well written and it gives a more clear view of Wing Chun's roots. Perhaps this book will help to silence some of the traditional hog wash I've heard and read from so called masters. One thing I'd like to know more about is the European influence on the art. Surely when the Westerners came over to China in the 19th century and before, some fights must have taken place. From my studies I know they faired well and I think this probably influenced Wing Chun through the great Leung Jan. Have you noticed that Wing Chun doesn't look like most other Kung Fu styles?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Wing Chun? No, not really.","review":"Yip Man's lineage is most dominant today.

First, the general layout of the buttons could use some improvement. For example, when you try to cradle it between your head and shoulder, it's almost impossible not to hit the mute button. Second, and much worse, the phones don't always connect to the base when you try to answer an incoming call. I've reprogrammed the handsets to the base 4 times now, and still the same thing happens---the phone rings, I try to answer it, it beeps and the screen says \\"unable to connect\\". Good thing I have caller ID, so I can call these people back! Third and most annoying is the customer service department. If they know of a way to fix this problem I'll never be able to find it as all I can get are pre-recorded messages. I even tried to e-mail their tech-support and got a pre-fab reply that didn't even relate to the problem I was having.

If I were in high school, college or a science buff, this book would be a great work to get as a gift - it places you in the scientific mindset of a great scientist.

Tim McVeigh has very complicated political beliefs that most people do not agree with. His act was in no way, shape, or form glorified in this book. It just simply made me realize what his mind is all about. This book made me cry for all of the victims, families, survivors, and citizens of Oklahoma City, but it made me realize that the government punishes death by death, and this is what McVeigh tried to radiate in the bombing. Life is sacred, yet, so easily taken. I do not feel sorry that McVeigh is sitting in jail, and I do not agree with what he has done, but the death penalty is wrong. I recommend this book for everyone to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oklahoma Bombing Disaster","review":"Timothy McVeigh was an average child growing up in rural America. An outstanding soldier who fought for his Country with no reservations. Then his mind changed regarding the US Government and the deletion of individual rights.

They are small and not made to last but they work fine and they are cheep. I got them for work as I am in Iraq and nothing works well for long here. I did not want to spend too much as we are waiting for the goverment to send pens made in the USA from EXPO and I must say the EXPO pens are better put do run a little more money. I do like the magnet that is on the back of the pen so they stick to the board as we do not have a tray on ours (welcome to Iraq)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible markers","review":"I ordered these because, well, I like color, and I was also ordering another dry erase board for my refrigerator after my last one quit staying glued to the magnets.These look like a good deal - I got them fairly cheap here on amazon, and there are different colors. I thought I could be creative and have nice colorful grocery lists.Except that at least three of my markers were dried out without me ever using them. The black was sort of watery (it did work, but not well). The purple turned watery and then lost all color. And the magnets aren't quite good enough to hold a single marker. If the pens weren't dried out, and had some sort of life, this would be fine - keeping them in the pack and sticking the pack on the fridge worked. They stayed on the fridge. But no, there's no point in having them on the fridge if they don't work at all.Next time I will just deal with fatter markers or fewer colors and buy markers from a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very light","review":"I purchased two sets.

Needed handy small erasers to erase small writing on day-to-day written details... So! for $3.66(Free Shipping!!??)

I think these were Billy's best work honestly. All of his new stuff is far too easy. Anyway, #3 was my very favorite and I used it until it died. I was thrilled when I saw it here on Amazon so I ordered it right away! I couldn't believe my luck!!! Well, what was in the box was not #3. The box said #3 and the video itself had a sticker on it that said #3 but it was absolutely not #3. It was one of the monthly volumes but just not the one it was supposed to be. I'm pretty disappointed as this one was more expensive than the others. Like I said though, this series is still WAY better and harder than Billy's new stuff so I might keep it.

It is quite dangerous to generalize that the entire region is full of families living in such conditions. There are poverty-stricken people in every region, even in inner-cities. Documentaries like this serve to perpetuate the \\"hillbilly\\" stereotype that is so demeaning and destructive to the proud people of Appalachia. Most of us are not living without modern conveniences, technological advances, or even advanced education. I would have appreciated the spirit of this effort if there had been any attempt to distinguish the experiences of this family from the majority of the population of Eastern Kentucky. Instead, they are presented as a typical example of the \\"modern\\" Appalachian family. That is a shamefully deceptive myth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quaint and inaccurate","review":"Quaint and inaccurate Reviewer: Eva Webster-Frizzell from Tennessee I have read and am appalled at the first of many inaccuracies in this book. The first, most glaring to anyone from the area is the caption of the two-page \\"homecoming\\" picture. The actual gathering is for a baptism. Anyone not recognizing this has spent a year not learning. Very disappointed in this book. I bought the book for my sister, a PHN working with people in very poor circumstances in the Sequatchie Valley of Tennessee. She had hoped to see the documentary but missed it. I hope she can look over the problems with the book, we can forgive Yankees who try to look at and into our lives and consistently get the wrong information.

As such, there is no particular plot - indeed, the conversation doesn't really go anywhere either. Each bear makes statements which he doesn't seem to understand, then tries to explain what he means to the other bear. (For example, at the start of the book one bear announces that he is an Idle Bear, but doesn't know why. Several pages later he states that his owner was an Idle, and that's why he's an Idle Bear.)I found it very hard to read, as it didn't follow any plot or train of thought, and assume it would also be difficult to listen to. The Idle Bear has been translated into several languages, and so it must have an appeal for certain readers. The pictures of the two pondering bears are very lovely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I love the larger MysticMaid cloths for windows, but the personal size one I used on my eyeglasses and did not like the results.

It was a bit slow but did end up being interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dragon Bones","review":"I've read all of her books & believe this one is very good, but it does drag a bit in some areas. The reader does become aware of China's fight to keep it's relics. Well written with lots of good information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Equal Parts Smart and Thriller","review":"A good yarn about thieving archaeologists and the biggest fungus on earth, Lisa See's Dragon Bones explores the tensions between western nations and post Cultural Revolution China. Set against the building of the Three Gorges Dam, this murder mystery also delves into the influence of Confucianism, Taoism, and Communism on modern Chinese identity. A jigger or two of smart mixed with equal parts thriller, the book is much better than the contrived hipster dadaism of Yu Hau's Brothers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great story","review":"This 3rd novel in the Red Princess Mystery series was not disappointing. Lisa See continues with her main characters and allows them to grow and reveal themselves further as their lives' circumstances change. The background of modern China brings great insight into what life is really like among is varied billion citizens. The background of the language, the history, and the current events bring everything into the mix for a truly suspenseful, beautifully written mystery. I can't wait for the next installment to see how Hulan and David progress in their lives together. Will they stay in China or move the States? What new international intrigue will be introduced into their lives?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect novel!","review":"All of the ingredients were present to make Dragon Bones the perfect novel: the characters were so developed and complex they practically jumped off the page; the plot was multi-layered with interesting twists and turns; Lisa See's engaging writing style and pace made for an enjoyable read; and the depth of information about Chinese culture and way of life rounded out the storyline.I would recommend this for anyone looking for a five star engrossing read that you just won't be able to put down.I read one other book by the author, Snow Flower and the Secret Fan, which I also loved, and was impressed by how different this novel was, and yet how much I enjoyed it. Clearly, Ms. See is an extremely talented writer capable of tackling very different types of novels. I can't wait to read another of her books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"East meets West","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I plowed through it in 2 days because I couldn't put it down.Don't look for any deep symbolism or meaning here - it's pure entertainment. The main characters are well drawn, and the plot interesting - a Chinese woman and her estranged American husband trying to solve a murder and theft of artifacts at an archeological dig. Liu Hulan and David Stark are an intense, powerful couple, and you are drawn into their anguish in the first few pages.Lively supporting characters at the dig site make the book even more fun. The plot twists and turns, changing your opinion of the characters multiple times before the book's fantastic finish.I did learn some things about Chinese culture and politics, but they were overshadowed by the luminous characters and gripping action."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rollicking good read","review":"This book was given to me as a gift, and it is such a marvelously good read that I heartily recommend it to all those who enjoy a ripping yarn. Dampier was a man of many parts, a traveler and adventurer who played a role in the history of a number of countries, observed their cultures, and was an important cartographer whose maps were used well into the 20th century. Although Dampier is a well-known figure in Australian and British history, it is surprising that he is not remembered for the role he played in U.S. history. William Dampier went everywhere, did everything and met many fascinating characters along the way.

It did have about 5 pages or so of actual information. I marked the rest of the book with a b.s. symbol. If anyone wants a book that already has the actual information marked off from the bs email me.If you want a book on this subject that still deals with religion somewhat I would recommend the Cosmic Octave by Cousto.

It will arrive in 5 to 7 business days.That is NOT my idea of good customer service.It is also INSANE to require the use of a land line telephone connection (which I do not have) when the unit contains networking components. It SHOULD offer to connect to WiFi right out of the box!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad quality - really bad customer support","review":"This gets one star because there is no lower ranking. Don't buy a Humax product unless you like paying new prices for used, rebuilt junk. Their new unit comes not working out of the box.

Unfortunately the warranty doesn't last long (i think it was 2 months or something). So we had to pay for a replacement. So if you buy this product, i hope you have time to spend hours on the the phone trying to get a replacement and i hope you don't mind having weeks where you have no box to use (while you are still paying for the tivo service).

Zim tries feebely to take over our planet for his species but is foiled in a hilaious off-beat way by his child arch-enemy, Dib. With a slap-stick and obsurd humor that this series produced, it's a shame it only ran three seasons. This box set has all 29 episodes and is well worth the investment if you enjoyed anything that Jhonen Vasquez has done in the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zim Rules!","review":"I started watching Zim to feel closer to my son, who loves the show. He is serving in Iraq. These DVDs are headed his way. In a sea of 'education' cartoons, it is refreshing to see one that is this funny.

I also ordered the special edition \\"Box\\" with extras DVD. While I can't recommend the second purchase, the first purchase is a gem. You will get everything you need and want from this simple purchase of $16. For the amount of money the crew had to work with and the time constraints placed on them, they produced a quality piece of work.My wife watched the series for the first time when I received the order and laughed aloud at the off beat humor. We will have years of enjoyment out of this series much like Boon Docks, Family Guy, and American Dad. Very entertaining.Enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't \\"quit\\" being exiled!","review":"Accidentally discovered this gem last year on NickToons. Somehow it never caught on, but it's a delight--from it's great edgy design to it's great edgy humor. Again, Nick makes something on an adult level that sneaks by as a kid's cartoon. This is a deliciously dark comedy about the most inept but ambitious of alien invaders Zim, and his defective robot sidekick \\"GIR\\", sent to the most incosequential of planets to invade, earth. Set your TIVO to pick up the pilot, and after viewing, you'll want the box set of all 17 episodes produced too. (Plus you'll understand the title of my review).

If you desperately want the house with Gir and extras disc buy the 3 disc set and the \\"house with extra's.\\" Ends up being around 50 dollars compared to the close to $100 for the complete house set.

As such, it may not appeal to everyone, and definitely isn't for young children, as it has various scenes of violence, though it usually isn't too graphic. For those who like the type of humor in the series though, this set is a must. All three volumes are packaged together nicely and for a very good price.

As a Montessori and Waldorf parent, it's always nice to read ideas in support of trusting a more organic approach to my children's development. However, I didn't feel this book had near the power of Elkind's earlier work, The Hurried Child. The book reads more like a pop psychology text.

The police procedures are not researched very thoroughly, and the timing of events are seriously flawed. The mystery was easily discovered, even though the facts didn't always add up, and there were a lot of unncessary information included while reading.In addition, the story starts with a character list and description when some of them are merely mentioned and never take stage in the story.I also found the romance to be a bit too flowery and unbelievable.This is a light one or two day read, that I would not recommend. Since the characters were not fully developed, the mystery pretty much ridiculous, and the read felt more like a chore. I don't think I'll give this author another try anytime soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Topic, Terrible Execution","review":"I was hoping I would like this movie. So many of my friends are frustrated with our tax code and don't understand the important history underpinning the subject matter of this film. I really wanted to like this so I could share it with my friends and educate them. But it was just....awful.Everything about the execution of this film was truly appalling. The graphics were cheesy and childish. I've seen higher quality graphics on YouTube. The subject matter was poorly organized and dragged on and on and on and on. By the end of the movie it had become monstrously repetitive. The final product definitely could've benefited from some brutal editing to cut the time and a better script for the narrative.I applaud the director for taking on this subject matter, because people who've challenged the tax code have a tendency to get audited. So kudos for that. But this is not something I would recommend to people with no existing understanding of the subject matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"UFOs Fascism","review":"I guess I'll be the first one to go against the grain here, but I think the DVD fails to mention the extraterrestrial forces at work against Earth. Since Earth is a hospitable planet with immense resources, we are under surveillance by aliens whose intent it is to conquer us.That what leads me to believe that the DVD might just be a misinformation campaign.I can't be sure either way since Bush damaged my brain.Need to Know: UFOs, the Military, and IntelligenceUFOs and the National Security State: Chronology of a Coverup, 1941-1973UFO's: 50 Years of Denial"},{"rating":"2","title":"America Freedom to Fascism","review":"Great movie.Everyone in America and the world should watch this movie.

Don't pay your taxes, don't get the national ID card, and don't support any effort by the government to limit your freedoms. Remember, big government equals more control.

I rate this as one of 2 videos that every American must see in order to start the process of regaining control of this country. We are being farmed like cattle and most people don't realize what is happening. \\"The Secret History of the Credit Card\\" is the other DVD that will wake you up to the reality of how we are slowly being enslaved.

It's time to spread the word."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Truth will set you free","review":"This revealing documentary takes away any doubt about the Federal Reserve cartel. Aaron Russo's questions to the IRS blows their cover. If this movie gets out to the public, it will start an avalanche of American Citizens taking back their country that the Bankers stole in 1913. The most important work since the Eustace Mullins work on the Feds and the Money Masters in 96."},{"rating":"2","title":"Throw out your 1040's","review":"This film was not very exciting, but it was educational to say the least. Russo explores the income tax law-or lack thereof-and exposes the IRS and the Federal Reserve as the unconstitutional and illegal entities that they are. I was a bit shocked myself to find out the dubious history and invalidity of the income tax. He also delves into the history of the Federal Reserve and some of their shady practices such as fractional reserve banking, which is essentially no different than counterfeiting. Russo's conclusion is that select bankers have essentially run this country for the past century, that their ultimate goal is world government, and that they are well on their way to achieving it. I'm not sure I agree with all of it, but I'd say he's basically on the right track. Definitely some enlightening food for thought as well as a good scare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agit-prop - libertarian style","review":"This movie held my interest for a few minutes, but it very soon became obvious that this is agitational propaganda for the Libertarian Party. Seen through their lens, America is a scary place where freedom is a lost commodity and we're all dupes for bankers. While there is, in my opinion, a modicum of truth to this, the libertarian's belief that government can not be part of the solution is asinine and the recent global economic meltdown is proof of that. It is only government - good, well managed government - that can create solutions. A free, unregulated, marketplace is dangerous."},{"rating":"1","title":"a little knowledge is a dangerous thing...","review":"While I think it's very good for citizens to know what's going on with their taxes, this drifts into paranoia. If you love freedom then you need to ask yourself: did you support school vouchers, social security reform, tax cuts, medical savings accounts? These issues would create more freedom and less government. In the documentry he says the media is in league with this 'Big Brother' conspiracy, but he sure had a lot of NY Times, and TV news clips supporting his claims. More like propaganda than education. No real solutions, just read Walter E. Williams......."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great movie for fanatics","review":"This is a great movie for people incapable of critical thinking. It's not even good propaganda since the mish-mish of anti-government messages (the director is a libertarian, of course) are so random, incoherent, and stridently repeated that only the most ardent believer of all this claptrap would leave with a favorable opinion. The purpose of propaganda is to PERSUADE, which this movie fails to do miserably. Any person with a grain of skepticism can spot this movie for what it is: a vain attempt to appeal to people's emotions with half-truths, distortions, and deception. It's a shame, because some of the issues presented in the movie are worthy of public concern (for example, the diminishing middle class in the US, the increase in the government's ability to compromise citizens' privacy). Unless you are a conspiracy theorist, you won't think much of this movie. Do yourself a favor and skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"America: Freedom to Fascism","review":"It's right on!!

The outline is disordered, which weakens the case and makes the movie seem thrown together. There are a few too many mouth-breathing zealot messengers who also harm the message.But as a patriotic, make-you-think, slap-upside-the-head work, this is absolutely top-notch.Those who shut it off before it's done are the same close-minded fools who said Hitler or Stalin couldn't be so bad, and by their inaction, made history what it typically becomes: oppression, slavery, genocide and war.Have we forgotten what governments typically do?

It's main purpose will be to serve as a travel crib once our baby is born. I'm not going to be using it as a main playpen so I love the smaller size. It doesn't take up very much room at all but still will be large enough to serve as a travel crib.This playpen is extremely easy to set up and break down. The product manual that came with it has several very helpful pictures and goes through each and every step without skipping anything at all. Which is great for people like me who need idiot proof instructions. :)Several reviewers have said that this playpen has a strong chemical smell. They are right. It's extremely smelly out of the box. Since we read reviews before we got it though, we anticipated this and have it set up and are airing it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"Good product for the price. The only thing I would add is you may want to invest in a better mattress as the existing mattress is too hard for an infant. Other than that, it is a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked wonderfully for 9 month old grandson","review":"We purchased this for overnight sleeping and naps for grandson's 4 day visit. We also purchased and used the Dream 3\\" Mattress, the mattress pad cover and the American Baby Co. Organic Cotton fitted sheets. Make sure those items are the size for the pack n play. This worked out great! Of course we used the lowest setting and he is too big to use the younger baby items that came with this pack n play. This was exceptionally easy to get out of box and set up....Thank you Amazon for shipping directly to our house, online shopping is fantastic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinky","review":"When I received this product it smelled musty. I sprayed a fabric freshener on it and placed it outside all day thinking it would air out. It did not! So I went to Meijer, Walmart, and Babies R Us and all the ones I opened in the stores smelled musty too. I think it is a bad batch! I will always smell a pack n play from now on!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great looking but horrible plastic odor!","review":"Not sure the chemicals used, but couldn't handle the horrible smell-it didn't get better after several days. Decided the odor wasn't something I wanted my baby smelling for 12-14 hours a day. Amazon made it so easy to return, thank goodness!"},{"rating":"2","title":"terrrrrifc!","review":"This is an excellent item. Our office purchased it for a baby shower gift and had fun putting it up. When you've done it once, it is so easy! It looks good and seems to be vey sturdy. We piled presents in it and we were so proud to give it. The upcoming parents are really happy with it. Especially when they saw how easy it is to take down and put back up. I highly recommend this product. I also believe that the price was very good. I've seen others in the store that didn't look as nice and were more expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"I bought it just for vacation. Don't regret it","review":"As long as you add a Dream on me Mattress it's the only thing you need for a toddler's great night sleep.I bought it just for vacation since I couldn't ship or check my baby's current Graco playard, so Amazon flawlessly shipped to my destination. Don't regret it.Don't over expend in more advanced options, this model is fine.Also the color it's not that bad once you get used to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"Product just as states. Easy to fold and to move from room to room. Sturdy. Very handy. Good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Graco Pack 'N Play Playard","review":"I bought this for my daughter's first born (not here yet). I wanted a bassinet that offered more. This is a perfect product especially for the price. It was easy to assemble, seems very sturdy and folds to a perfect store able or travel size. I love the colors which with a pink blanket fits either a boy or girl. It's a great bedside bassinet for a newborn with conversion to playpen or sleep quarters when the baby gets a little older. I shop for versatility at a great price and found it in this product. I am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend it for any expected parents or grandparents (for when the little one comes to visits)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, basic product for price","review":"We purchased this as a temporary crib to leave at Grandma's house for when we visit so we did not need it to be extremely durable, easy to transport or entertain the baby. It certainly served that purpose and is a good value for the price.We own the Chicco Playyard at home and between the two, I prefer the Chicco because the base mat is thicker, it feels sturdier and the toys and music add-ons are more entertaining for our baby. Of course, the Chicco costs twice as much, so I'd say, for the price, this Graco is a good value for a basic product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mattress is too soft, flimsy","review":"My wife had this item on her baby shower registry and it was one of the few items we got without researching fully first. Everything I've read when buying cribs is a FIRM mattress is the best way to reduce suffocating/SIDS risks. The \\"mattress\\" that comes with this pack & play is much softer than the one in our crib, and very lumpy and bendable. It feels like it is 4 pieces of hard cardboard with foam on top. My sister's pack and play mattress is much sturdier - it feels like particle board underneath and does not bend and sag under moderate pressure like this unit. We will be returning it this weekend and shopping at a brick and mortar store just so we can touch the mattress first before buying. Very disappointing since I'd much rather buy everything from Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Graco playard","review":"My only complaint is you can't just lift the bassinet out and have the base ready to use right away. You have to take the bassinet base out and insert it in the bottom of the playard to use the base. Minor detail, but it does add another step and takes away from the convenience of use. (FYI, buy the little mattress that goes with it. These are super hard for baby to lay on. With my first children, they didn't sell the mattress. So glad they came up with it!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect for newborns!","review":"This product was for a newborn grandchild..the mattress can be raised, thereby saving the adult's back..comes with a mini mobile, good for baby's eye focusing..playard is sturdy and easy to clean. would definitely recomment it..good value, too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dangerous & poor quality","review":"i bought this pack n play for travel & to leave at my in laws house when they baby sit my 6 month old baby. we first noticed that the mattress does not lay flat, it slopes to one side, it is not very firm & overall seems very flimsy.most alarming to us was that my son got hurt rubbing his foot a little while on the extremely rough fabric mesh on the side causing a considerable amount of bleeding. we will no longer use this pack n play for fear of him getting hurt. when i spoke to a representative from graco they said the best they could do is refund the cost of the pack n play once they have it back in their possession. unfortunately, i do not live in the united states & they will not pay for the shipping to get it back to them.we have in our home another graco pack n play that is made better, stronger, the mesh is much softer & my son has never hurt himself in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it, but....","review":"I own a graco pack n play myself and I love it! It is so convenient to have, you can store your diapers in it, use it as a bassinet and a changing table! I bought this kind for my friend who said she didn't need the changing table. She said it is wonderful and she loves it, HOWEVER, she told me to tell consumers when I review the product that the DIRECTIONS ARE TERRIBLE. She said that the directions do not apply to all pack and plays and some parts are made for certain pack and plays and she said it did not explain which ones. She said the Graco Pack N Play makers need to learn how to right specific directions for the CORRECT product.OTher than that it is wonderful and I recommend and she does to to anyone wanting to purchase it.:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pack n Play - Blue color is darker than thought","review":"I was looking for a fairly neutral colored pack n play since we were not sure if it would be a boy or girl. The pastel teal color I thought this was turned out to be a more muted blue color. We had a girl so I was a little disappointed on that front but overall it is a great pack n play."},{"rating":"1","title":"No support in the middle","review":"I was excited when I receive this product. I have had this product and been using it 2.5mths now and very disappointed. The bassinet sunk in the middle with the weight of the baby. My daughter was born at 5lbs 11oz and is now at 10lbs, so it is not a heavy baby. She sleeps in it only at night and no other time. The bassinet has for parts that lay cross section of playyard and the middle two has sunken. It looks very uncomfortable watching my daughter sleep in it as her head then straddles the groove which is flat to the one which is sunken. It is unfortunate that this product was not engineered to consider the support required for the middle. I will post a picture of this as soon as I can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't count the # of pinched fingers I've gotten","review":"[...]I don't know how many times my fingers have gotten caught in the pack \`n play when I am trying to break it down and unlock the sides. I thought this thing was suppose to be for convenience not butchering your fingers?! How many of you have gotten ouchies from a pack \`n play ? I'm just glad little fingers are not strong enough to unlock the sides and get their fingers caught!"},{"rating":"1","title":"smelled bad","review":"For some reason, this had a strong smell..kinda like horse poop. This one and another one I bought at the store..Graco has some stuff that smells really bad.. But I went to walmart and bought another one and it didnt smell at all. Must have been a bad batch or something. Same issue with the joovy one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect for Gramma's house","review":"perfect for visits from Grandbaby. Easy to assemble. Takes little space. Wheels easily from room to room. Serves as a dressing table and crib now, and will convert to a playpen as baby gets bigger. Basic features, very functional. Absolutely worth the reasonable price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good buy","review":"I bought this pack and play because it was one of the least expensive and had the buttons on the sides for easier opening and closing. I am very pleased with this so far. The pattern in really lovely, much nicer then it looks in the picture. No need to spend more on the fancier models, this one looks great and works well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Pack N Play, Good Bed","review":"We really like this Pack N' Play, and use this as our baby's primary bed, rather than purchasing a separate crib. We did add a separate mattress from IKEA. Easy to pack up and set up, my only complaint is that the included base does dip a lot after extended use. It's not a problem with a very firm mattress, but now that we use a slightly softer one, I flip the base every time I change the sheets to keep the middle from sagging."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"I was very disappointed in this pack n play. The mat that you lay inside once the frame is set up does not lay straight. Instead you get a lumpy uneven surface which could be in my opinion a suffocation hazard. I am surprised this model has not been recalled for this reason. Save your money and get a different model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super easy to use","review":"I have purchased three Gracos over the past 15 years and really appreciate the improvements. This is by far the best. It is the lightest and has no fold up glitches. I also really like how easy it is to put in the bassinet. It has rounded clips that go over each bar on the 4 sides and is very secure. This model does not come with any extras which is why I bought it. Over the years I have learned that models with lots of extras also means an extra headache when you want to store or travel with the extras. Generally the bag these come with only fits the playpen, the bassinet and the pad. Changing tables did not fit in. I don't know about toy bars because I never bought them. In my opinion, keep it simple. When you want to travel you don't want all the extras anyway. This model does the job just as well as all the models with all the bells and whistles..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for our new granddaughter","review":"Like another reviewer, we got this for when our new granddaughter spends the day with us. It was really easy to set up, even with the added time of reading the directions, which are clear and well written. One of the things that led me to choose this one is that I'm just 5' and having to reach into a full-sized playpen is hard, but the depth on this is just perfect. I don't think anyone else mentioned that there are wheels on one end, so if you want to move it around the room, etc., you just lift the other end slightly and you can roll it anywhere you want. It seems really well made, the price is excellent and I can't wait for baby Emma to try it out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mattress bunches up","review":"Maybe ours was a dud, but the mattress bunches up after putting on sheets, causing a large bump right in the middle. It's impossible to place our child sleeping not on the bump, so I imagine sleeping in the Pack 'N Play isn't very comfortable for him. Fortunately we are only using it on trips."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pack and play","review":"After reading many reviews for diffrent pack and plays I decided on the Graco Kensly. It's simple and very easy to set up and take down. The price was very affordable and I love the unisex color and plain design. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because there was a smell when I took it out of the package. I Febreezed it down and aired it out for a couple of days and the smell is completely gone. I am very happy with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"its alright","review":"I was very happy with how quickly the package came and how easy it was to assemble. I wish the mobile was a little nicer it seems to be very cheaply made but I guess it is true; you get what you paid for!! Haven't had any problems yet but I'm still waiting for my little one to arrive so I will have to write a review later on."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Far So Good","review":"Purchased this item as a shower gift for my grand daughter that will be born in a few months so it's a little early to say how it work. I do know that mom-and-dad-to-be really like the colors and functionality and said it was easy to assemble. The best part is it was shipped to Germany via an APO address and arrived in 7 days which amazed me. Even by choosing the free shipping it arrived in time for the baby shower. Amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I bought the Rise and Shine Grace Pack n Play. It looks even better than I thought. My teenage daughter had it put together in about 1 minute. And most important my granddaughter sleeps well in it. Great buy also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Purchase!!","review":"I purchased this pack n play to have at my house for my new granddaughter. This pack n play is so cute and so easy to use! I was looking for a used one and used ones were almost the price of this new one. I would highly recommend this to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Away from home","review":"This is a handy little bed for the first year at Grandma's house or any other overnighter stay. Just to keep baby contained and safe from the dogs or keep them off drafty floors. I did put an \\"egg-crate\\" foam mattress in the bottom covered with a bath-sheet, nice and tight. Or else it is too hard and sweaty to just lie on a plastic covered piece of cardboard. With weight increase the top level will sag in the middle. We haven't gotten to the bottom level yet. It is an back-up bed for short term use not for every night. And I love the play-pen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mattress does not lay flat","review":"I bought this pack n play to use in my bedroom as a bassinet for my newborn daughter. After I set it up, I noticed the mattress would not lay flat with or without a sheet. I went to babies r us and looked at all the Graco's and all of the mattresses had the same issue. I ended up buying a Chicco and I love it. The mattress cover on the Chicco also comes off for easy washing, something Graco does not have. The Chicco is a lot more expensive, but it's a lot more sturdy and the mattress actually lays flat. I was unable to return it because I had it for too long before I opened it, so I will probably leave it at grandma's house as a back-up."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a GREAT portable playard!","review":"This is extremely easy to put up/break down. We use for travel and home. My 22 lb 9 month old seems very comfortable sleeping and playing in it. I do wrap a quilted blanket around the pad for extra comfort, but he'd probably be fine without it. I definitely recommend this playard! No frills, BUT A GREAT VALUE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ok- but wouldn't buy it again","review":"We liked this product intially and the price was fair, but after only 3mos of occasional usage one of the sides broke/won't latch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what we needed!","review":"The perfect portable! Sturdy and a workable size, so definitely recommending this one for a bassinet substitute or just to have on hand for short trips (even if it's just to the living room...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great buy","review":"I ended up buying this same playard through another online retailer because, after placing my amazon.com order, the shipment was damaged by UPS and returned to Amazon.com. I was never notified of the problem - they just cancelled my order. Regardless, even though my Amazon experience was not a good one, the playard itself is wonderful. Its a nice warm brown, almost chocolaty. It sets up and folds easily and quickly and goes into its storage bag easily. The large bassinet snaps easily onto the frame, unlike other models that use bars and latches, and it stores easily into the bag with the playard for travel. This playard doesn't have all the \\"frills\\", such as music or a changing table, but as a mom of 3 I know that those features are not very useful past a certain age, anyway. I'd rather have an attractive, sturdy, economical playard that will give lots of practical use and that is exactly what this model offers. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"So easy to use, great product for the price","review":"with 2 babies we needed to get a pack n play, this was a great choice. It is just the right size and with the added bassinet feature, both of our children were able to benefit from it. My only complaint would be the case; it seems to be more difficult than it should be to make everything fir into the case. the play yard is very easily collapsible and the mattress surrounds that with ease as well. However, when it comes time to put the bassinet netting, the poles and the mobile in side the case as well - you really have to get creative! More often than not, I have to fidget with all the accessories to get everything to fit in smoothly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Sturdy for a 16lb infant","review":"I received this as a registry item. I am very disappointed in the product. I only just opened it b/c my daughter is beginning to learn to crawl and we need a safe location for her while we get ready in the morning or cook dinner. Unfortunately b/c the mattress is so flimsy and she doesn't crawl yet, she falls over very easily (even with a boppy to hold her up). The mattress bends both ways and does not use the legs to support it. I am looking to replace or return this item. The bassinet (which we never used) is a little more sturdy b/c of the metal bars, but she's too big and pulls herself over to the edge and could pull herself up and over.My sister has a great pack and play (at my mom's) where the bottom does not bend the opposite direction, which I think makes it a ton more sturdy.Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to set up, weird smell.","review":"I received this product on time, and for the price, I love it! It's very easy to set up. The only issue I had with its assembly was finding where to put the metal poles for the bassinet... And all it took was a little bit of common sense to figure out. :)The smell of this, however, was awful. It was a mix between chemical-plastic, and as if the guy who packaged it was a heavy smoker. I wiped it down with Lysol wipes and have been letting it air out over the past three days. It's getting better. The mattress is thin, yes, but that's to be expected from something that comes folded.I will update my review when my baby arrives!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Graco pack N Play playard w/ bassinet","review":"Perfect for our needs.

Very satisfied with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice and Easy","review":"I'm new to the Playard, pack-n-play arena, so was pleased I understood the directions and could assemble quickly. The only downside would be that they tell you to attach the bottom with the velcro tabs. I found that I could not do that once I put on the sheet. Nevertheless, the bottom has been secure so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product at a nice price","review":"I did a lot of price checking and reviewed many reviews trying to find the right playard. This was perfect because we did not need a changing table or other extras, just a bed for travel , etc. The bassinet seems well made, though my baby is already to big to use it so we won't be needing that. It is very easy to assemble and feels very sturdy. I also really like the color, I have a girl but like the gray and gender neutral pattern on the Pasadena.******For clarification from another review this DOES in fact have the straps on the pad to secure to the bottom bars with snaps so the pad will not move or sink*******This also packs up very nicely and will be very convenient to take on trips. There is NO need to spend twice the $$ .... this is a great product and a great price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mattress Sucks","review":"It's cute enough, but the mattress is terrible. My baby somehow bent the \\"boards\\" with his weight (9-10 lbs) and it didn't lie flat. We ended up putting support under the mattress which you're probably not supposed to do, but it helped a lot. I probably wouldn't buy this one again. I had a similar one with my daughter and it was fine, so I'm not sure what the deal is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bring every where with me!","review":"This is a great product! We keep it in the car with us just in-case! Our daughter doesn't seen to mind sleeping in it and she is pretty pick about where she sleeps. We camp a lot and this comes in handy. It was easy to set up but tricky to put away at first but we got the hang of it quick. The only down side I've found is that the zipper broke on the bag that you store it in. Kind of a bummer other then that I recommend it to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute but a pain to put together.","review":"I bought this as a gift for my sister. When I went to put it together, the sides wouldn't lock in place.

Just pull up on the strap in the center of the \\"floor\\" of P&P.; Also, I found the instructions after my neighbor left...in a pouch that is attached to the mattress."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Very easy to open and close.

Mattress is horrible and expensive to replace!!!!","review":"We bought a pack n play for our first baby, she slept in the bassinet part for the first 4 months or so, poorly, I might add. Then a year and a half later, we are setting it up for our newest baby due in a few weeks, and the mattress has a giant bend in the middle that will not flatten out, it isn't safe for a newborn to sleep on, it's all bunched up and you can't even get a sheet on it. We only used it for that first four months and then a little bit of play pen time, maybe 10-15 times. This is soooo poorly made. Went to GRACO webiste for a replaement and of course it is OUT OF STOCK! hahah, that's because everyone has to buy one. Buying another pad from another company to fit it is nearly $40!!! Such a mistake, I really do not advise anyone to buy any of the GRACO pack n plays....find another atlternative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrated","review":"So I had this on my registry on another site, and am sad to say that each time I rec'd this product (3x within the span of a week) the mattress was defective. I contacted Graco, and they told me that they could get me a new mattress in over a month... anyway, I'm frustrated with the mattress pad because it has several dents the size of a baby's head, which seems like a huge suffocation risk! There is no way I would let my baby sleep on this. I am hoping that there are other pack and plays that do not have mattress pads that are lumpy and saggy.

The bassinet attachment works well for infants and is easy to take out when they start sitting or pulling up. It's a good thing to have around for safety (pulling up on the oven at dinnertime, etc.) and a simple design. I like that I didn't have to pay hundreds of dollars extras for the attachments that no one I know uses (changing station, etc.). Seems pretty sturdy. The only concern I had was the strong chemical smell when we first unpacked it, but we let it air out before using, and it went away pretty quickly.

The pack and play breaks down easily and smoothly fits into its storage case - but carrying the pack and play in the case is cumbersome and awkward. If Graco could add a shoulder strap to the storage bag - this product would be perfect. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very stinky but functional","review":"I bought this pack n play as a back up bed to keep at grandmother's house.

It is four board-like pieces that are unattached from each other with foam over them. The problem was it was difficult to lay it completely flat. It kept wanting to buckle at the joints between boards. Once I messed with it I did get it to lay flat, just make sure the sheet you use is big enough or it will cause it to buckle.

This is about as complicated and useful as most strollers and made from similar materials but yet its surprisingly quite affordable.I am quite pleased by the ease and simplicity of the set up, I've never set up a pack n play before and it took me just a few minutes to figure out and set up the yard both ways.I like the snap on bag for the cover and other items; I am keeping a pack n play sheet, the cover, a waterproof pad and an extra toy or two in it.Other points:The yard is quite heavy when collapsed, I don't know how relevant that is.The colors are pleasing; very close to what you see in the image.I am really looking forward to using this at my home and at my parent's houses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bassinett matress lumpy and unsafe for infants","review":"My daughter and I both bought this product thinking the bassinett feature would be a good daytime nap spot for her newborn. Within 2 weeks, both mattresses started bending in the middle and became so lumpy we could not put the baby on it. This product should not be sold as a bassinette option. I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect to leave at Grandma's house","review":"Purchased this Pack N Play to leave at Great Grandma's house. No bells & whistles, no bassinet, no changing table but it does have an upper and lower sleep level. Simple and perfect for limited use and a reasonable price. Wheels are a help in moving it around. Construction felt solid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Safety first","review":"My daughter now has 4 Graco Pack 'N Play for her daycare business.

I babysit my granddaughter and this works very well at my house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap mattress board warps easily. Not worth it.","review":"I am so annoyed at the poor quality of the mattress in this pack and play. I hesitate to call it a mattress, because it's really a fold up board. My 16 pound, 5 month old baby was apparently too heavy for it, because after a week it has warped under her weight. Yes, my baby is a chunky monkey, but shouldn't this product be sturdy enough to last more than a week? I wondered why this pack and play was so much cheaper than the others, and maybe this is why. Perhaps if you only need to use this for one or two days at a time it will work for you. Not for long trips."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Quality, Ok Price","review":"I purchased the Graco Pack 'N Play with the Bassinet and found it to be exactly what was described. I like the neutral colors and the ease of transport. The padding was actually pretty substantial- more than I expected. I did, however, think that the bassinet's quality did not merit a $13 increase in price from the Pack 'N Play that does not include it. But overall, I am very pleased and would recommend the product. Amazon redeemed themselves this time and shipping was very fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hawaiimama","review":"I received the Graco pack 'play and it was very easy to set up. It arrived in good condition. I would have rated it 5 stars, except the pad is not properly fitted. It seem there are air pockets and we can't flatten it out. However, perhaps when we put it on the bottom of the playard, maybe it will be better. I didn't want the hassle of returning it, as I need to use it now. This is mainly used when grandma is baby sitting the grandchild, at their house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for baby!","review":"This is our second pack and play that we have purchased and only because we gave away our old one when we thought that we were done at two kids. :) We used the first one over and over again with our two kids and when watching our nephew when he was smaller and other niece and nephew when they came into town. No complaints here, easy set up, easy to pack back up and move; our second child napped in it during the day as a baby, and it made for easy changing too. We are expecting our third in the fall and this was the first must have item that we needed to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"YES! Great for traveling. Light weight and crib comfy.","review":"I have a really nice and big pack in play but it is very heavy and a pain to break down. You definitely aren't going to be able to travel with it. It's also a pain to move from floor to floor. This one is very light and about half the size of my big one. This one is tiny which is great if you are using it as a crib for travel (like I am) or if you want to move it from floor to floor on a whim (like I will). If you have very little room in your house get this. If you have loads of space in your house and are using it more for a pen then move on, this one is too small."},{"rating":"2","title":"good product","review":"My husband and I purchased this PnP to use in our bedroom till our baby is old enough to sleep in his room. I researched alot of different PnP and I found that all the ones that had all the extra accessories like changing table or napper all had issues or complaints. I settled with getting a simpler version and so far Im very happy. It took us less then 10 min to set up the whole thing. Its very sturdy amd really cute. After adding a fitted quilted blanket sheet on it it seems very comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Graco Pack 'n Play Portable Playard with Bassinet in Rise and Shine","review":"Graco makes great products, but this one was not up to par. The main problem was that this particular Pack 'n Play doesn't have the four corner tabs that the floor sort of snaps into. When our very petite daughter would stand at the edge, her weight would cause the floor to slip and she would slowly drop a few inches down. Life threatening? No. But it was not very stable. I assumed all Pack n' Play products had the corner tabs that make for a secure floor. We ended up purchasing another Graco model and it has been perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best buy","review":"The Graco pack and play was cheap but is well made and represents excellent value - the mattress needs a bit more padding but that can easily be added.Overall very well made and why pay more?"},{"rating":"2","title":"No frills pack n play","review":"It's easy to fold and unfold and it's a nice safe place for baby to play.

It's perfect for traveling to grandparents or even hotels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Item","review":"Bought pack n play to replace an older model. It is super cute, love the colors and the toy bar, and LOVE that is has wheels so it can easily be moved around. I wish that 2 or 3 sides had the option to be covered instead of see-through mesh...that way if there are other kids in the room, baby isn't so easily distracted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome for a boy!","review":"This pack-n-play is AWESOME for our son! NOT only did we use it when he was first born, but we also use it now that he is moving around a lot and crawling as a place for us to put him while we get ready in the morning if one of us is not on the bed with him! He loves it and so do we ! Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Graco is a star!","review":"Love this play pen. Easy setup. Love the bed mat which raises higher for new infant so you do not have to bend down so far. Cute little mobile comes with this. Also carry case is so handy for travel We love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value!","review":"We looked at several. This is the best Pack 'n Play for the $59 we paid. Fast delivery. It does not have all the extras (like a changing table or outragous mobiles, shade cover) but we were not interested in paying for stuff we did not want. I appears to be very similar (if not the same) as many others, with less buttons and whistles and at a better price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Satisfied","review":"I ordered this product because my daughter was coming to visit with my newest grandson for a month. I bought and used Graco products when she was a baby 22 years ago. I am very happy with the value I received for my $67 for the Graco Pack 'n Play Playard with Bassinet in Tango in the Tongo. And more importantly my daughter was very pleased as well. She said it's much nicer than some of the other playyards she and her husband checked out for use in their home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"My daughter had been hinting to me for a few months that I should get this for Grammie's house. Once she chipped in, I happily purchased this playard. It was very easy to assemble, and light enough to move from room to room. Since my granddaughter is only 5 months old, we're still using the bassinet insert. Compared to others I researched, the price is right and it's a great value!"},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect size and strong!","review":"My son loves it and we can move it around easy. It was simple to setup and despite what people say it is strong."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great crib for our vacation home","review":"My daughter is now 2 years old and still sleeps comfortably in this pack n go when we're at our vacation home. As a newborn she would sleep soundly in the bassinet, as well. The mesh sides mean that is is very breathable, and no throwing the pacifier out of the crib with those mesh walls! The mobile is pretty useless and flimsy. The colors are nice and you can get some cute fitted sheets that go with it.If you're looking for something smaller and more mobile, try a KidCo PeaPod. It's like a little dome tent that you set up on a bed or floor. We wanted something for our camper for our daughter when she was about a year old and it works great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good buy but...","review":"I bought this PNP seeing that it was a cheap price but good brand of product. It came pretty quick and it was easy to assemble and pack away but like what others have said before it has a very different odor of sorts. We kept it up all night to get it to air out and it kinda did but yeah the only complaint is the smell of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"This was a perfect choice for my needs. I needed a easily set-up, compact bed for my 3-month-old grand-daughter. After her visit, I sent it home with my daughter. Since she lives in a one bedroom apartment, she uses it in the living room (where it doesn't take up a lot of room)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great","review":"The Pasadena is grey in color just like the picture. Assembly is a snap! Very happy with it.My child is 18lbs now and seems fine in the bassinet part. He sleeps in this at night since it's easier to get him in and out compared to the crib. If the bed padding seems to sag a little, just put a stiff cardboard underneath."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basic but efficient !","review":"This is a basic pack and play but I found it easy to set up and take down, and very efficient!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I got this when my daughter was 5 months while we were on vacation and it was awesome!

None of this is unfamiliar territory as I'm a soapmaker who dabbles in other toiletries; not a stranger to procuring esoteric ingredients in other words. But this book is beyond impractical for anyone who wants to simply get their feet wet and try to make lotions or creams. When you put \\"101\\" on a cover it implies this is \\"everything you ever wanted to know but didn't know to ask\\", but this book falls short of that implied claim.

Also, for many of the recipes there are no alternative ingredients listed for the ones I was allergic to. The recipes that are good for only one or two applications would on occassion be a treat but not practical for everyday use.

Nevertheless, re-writing this book to serve the gay community is problematic, when the underlying premise of the original (Tibetan) text was the ultimate union of the 'yab-yum' (Tibetan equivalent of yin-and-yang) - the 'male' and 'female' principles in the cosmos. Does it make any sense, when viewed as a union of two 'yabs' or two 'yums'? Without 'yab-yum' - none us could be born in the first place, the same applies to the phenomenal universe. How much so, then, must the ultimate union embrace finding ourselves in a 'union of the opposites.' Can you have a magnet, with two 'north poles' or two 'south poles'?

The author's 20 years of experience in the Ecuadoran Amazonia show in the depth of her narrative and in her careful and accessible use of Foucault to draw out the complexities of indigenous identity, conceptions of nation and nationalism, and the impact of global forces. It is also beautifully written. Clearly, a labor of love and conviction by a scholar who has spent hours listening to indigenous activists , oil company officials, state officials, NGO workers, academics, and, most importantly native Ecuadorans of widely diverse political views and fashioned a wonderful book. If you are interested in all the complex political issues surrounding globalization as seen from the Amazon, you don't need a Ph.D to find this a great read"},{"rating":"1","title":"One-sided","review":"This is a failed ethnography. It is incredibly one sided. Sawyer claims to be the voice for the indigenous peoples, but she only studies OPIP, dismissing the DICIP.

His descriptions of the time in which the story takes place, the people, the places and events, pull you into the story and don't let you out, even when the tale is \\"finished\\". Stories like this live on in your heart. I especially liked his description of a hurricane which moved inland, and how it affected the weather miles away, and how that in turn has such a profound affect on the lives of each of the characters.

It seemed to me that he didn't want her to say anything or indeed acknowledge her as having anything to do with the book at all. After watching him, it's not too strong to say it appeared he would stop at little if he could to prevent her from being on stage with him at all, he was simply so determined to eclipse her and take sole credit for the entire book. I was really taken aback after seeing how he behaved with her, and thought it shameful.If a man is so threatened, as he certainly was, I can't be surprised at some of the retro philosophy in this book.

No, but as sequels go, it outshines most of them. It's a miracle R2 was even made considering the utter revolt against RAZEN, the \\"official\\" sequel. Besides, look at how weak the american RING 2 was! At least there are no ultra-fake, CGI deer-attacks in RINGU 2! Yes, some of the stuff was a bit kooky, and I for one wanted Sadako herself to rise from that swimming pool like the hideous, petrifying ghoul she is!

A worthy addition to anyone's japanese horror collection..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The final Ringu","review":"The first \\"Ringu\\" was a superb horror film that really didn't need a sequel. Hideo Nakata, who directed both films, seems to understand that the less we see of Sadako, the ghostly villain of this series, the scarier she is. However, that fundamental truth is directly at odds with the production of more films about her. This installment is mostly dull and incoherent. It becomes silly at times, such as the sequence in which a scientist attempts to drain the \\"Sadako energy\\" from a cursed victim into a swimming pool. I can't recall a single film that has successfully wedded empirical scientific method to the supernatural; it always comes off looking ridiculous. Having seen the entire Ringu cycle now, I can say that they--and you--should stop after the first film."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!!!","review":"There are two sequels to Ringu: The Spiral (AKA Rasen) and Ringu 2. Neither of them are very entertaining and this one is even less entertaining than The Spiral; in fact, it isn't entertaining at all. It is extremely hard to follow, very very boring, and not even the slightest bit scary. It is everything that Ringu isn't. It is one of the biggest wastes of my time and money that I've ever spent. I am a huge fan of the entire Ring series, including the American remakes and the novels as well. I'd recommend the American version of Ring 2 before I'd recommend this piece of garbage. That one also isn't scary, but at least it's entertaining. However, I highly recommend the prequel to Ringu, which is Ring 0: Birthday. That is highly entertaining and (IMO) scarier than Ringu and The Ring combined."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical Creativity","review":"Tera Leigh's book is a very accessible guide to discovering your own creative talents.

On the Limp Bizkit song, I expected to hear the sound of someone walking and hearing the Undertaker say \\"Dead Man Walking\\" and then go into \\"Rollin'\\", but all I hear is a motorcycle sound. The only reason I didn't give this album 1 star is because there are some songs on this album that I do like. I like Drowning Pool's version of \\"The Game\\", the Disturbed song, and the Creed song. That's pretty much it. In my opinion, not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"The WWF's musical team never fails to produce some of the best rock songs to listen to.

Laurel & Hardy take it back to their room despite the \\"No Pets\\" rule and wackiness ensues. This 1929 comedy directed by Lewis Foster from a story by Leo McCarey with one day legendary film director George Stevens working the camera, has the distinction of being the last complete silent film by Laurel & Hardy.

I love many of her recordings. In her prime, she was magnificent. This is a SAD performance. Quite frankly, this is pitiful. This was a cast that was marketed on the fame and abilities of years past. Nilsson's voice is strained and off pitch (some reviewers will acknowledge this was sometimes an issue in her prime as well). The high notes are not there.I challenge any serious critic to present this performance blindly to a listener familiar with the opera, but not necessarily the cast. With the cast being anonymous, I guarantee you this performance will be judged as being substandard.Further, Nilsson was never a great actress. No one here can tell me that a 62 year old woman is \\"throwing herself\\" into the role.Anyone who claims this is a magnificent performance simply calls his or her credibility into question."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment....","review":"Evidently, Mr. Morris from Toronto, Canada, and I are the only ones to get the bad DVDs in this forum. Moreover, the only female voice to even SOUND decent was Mignon Dunn's, most probably because she's a mezzo and the engineering is less difficult than with high (and often, bigger, voices). The best of part of the DVD was watching and hearing the hysterical audience. Since I can only hear/see opera canned, it's no wonder I to often have a warped idea of who sounds like what. So I have never gotten the benefit of adoring certain singers, if you see what I mean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Genius Betrayed","review":"A brilliant production of a work of genius rendered hopelessly and utterly useless by unbelievably inept engineering. Imagine having to strain to hear Birgit Nilsson's expression of towering rage and despair in her powerful 'Agamemnon' monologue? (BIRGIT NILSSON of all people!!!) Barely audible enough to hint at what must have been a truly awedome and spine-tingling performance in the flesh. Left me hanging for more and very dissatisfied indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"opera looking for singers","review":"I was just watching this and I had to turn it off.

Nilsson's involvment in this role is overwhelming too such a degree that you can ignore that her voice sounds a bit worn. The public roars - and rightly so. If you want to experience Nilsson as one of the truly great actors of the operatic scene, buy this DVD at once. I was deeply moved and cried at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Episode","review":"I think that The Ghost Next Door is a really good episode.

It arrived in good condition and looked good. My bad review is not for the movie itself, but for the DVD options.There is an error on the packaging. It states that the DVD has captions.However, it does not and I could not turn them on at all. If you look at the screenshot of the back cover on here, you can see that it says, \\"Captioned.\\" However, even this does not work because there is no menu option for the captions and remote access does not work either. This DVD was unwatchable as a result and I had to return it.The difference between subtitles and close captions are that subtitles can be turned on via menu access or remote. Closed captions should be the same, but most DVD companies often forget to put the closed captions on DVDs or do not include them in the menu, so they cannot be turned on.Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A movie that tried to become scary, but failed","review":"A movie that tried to become scary, but failed. Yep, that's what the Ghost Next Door did. It is a rather odd movie. The thing with Goosebumps movies... They never follow the book. Never. It is about a twisted child named Hannah Fairchild. She see's this black ghastly ( to her. But not to me) image. She dials September 11 ( 911). The phone doesn't work. She stupidly runs outside. A kid says boo. She screams. That's the movie.

For the price it isn't bad at all. Mea Culpa: Everything the complainers say is true. The frets are sharp and it's tough to keep it in tune. It's made in China, do the math. But you know what, you get what you pay for. This is not a performance instrument. This is the perfect low-risk purchase for beginners and players like me that are ready to get their playing chops back. Reviewers will tell you if you want the true experience, spend a little more. Parents (weary that it'll go into the closet after two or three plays) don't want to hear that. Price is everything in these tough economic times. The quality is totally acceptable for the entry price.

After lots of planning, trenching, and backaches I fired the system up to awe at the beauty of hassle-free watering. To my surprise and chagrin, I have not been able to enjoy the fruits of my labor, as every day I have had to fiddle with a head or two. One will get stuck on return, while another (a 360 degree uninterrupted cycle) will inexplicably stick. All told I will be replacing 5 of the 36 Toro heads I installed (probably with Rainbirds or Orbits) in an effort to achieve my goal.

For sure the print edition is a hulking load. But navigating the kindle edition is a big headache. I never know where I am in the text. Jump to a text note, then try to get back. Sure you can click to go back, but the pagination will be different when you go back. Try to jump to a new spot in the bible using the grab bar at the bottom? Good luck! Your chances of landing on a page of text notes or cross references are higher than landing on the text itself. Location 3256 out of 178,008 is meaningless. You have no idea where you are in the book unless you navigate by way of the table of contents. There are no page headings to let you know what book chapter and verse you are looking at. Sometimes you have to scroll back a page or two to find the next chapter heading.

In addition, to move the slider to a specific location, what book/chapter/verse are you going to if it says \\"location 340800 of 391179\\"? Very disappointing for those of us that know how quick electronic Bible indexing can work. [If you own an iPhone/iPad, look at Paul Avery's excellent \\"Holy Bible\\" App...wish it existed for Android].Finally, while I have enjoyed the NIV translation for 32 years, do some research on this 2011 rendition of the NIV (vs. 1984 and prior)...in my view, this is no longer an accurate translation of the original texts and there are better ones out there.Having said all of that, it may or may not be worth the $8+ for you depending on how you will use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left-hand letters chopped off","review":"I found several sections that had the first letter on the left-hand margin chopped off.

Also, provide an icon (or other tool) to skip past App provided notes and explanations usually found at the end of the book. i.e. When trying to read the bible through from cover to cover and you get to the end of a book, you have to scroll past several pages of notes to move on to the next book.Overall: I am very happy and satisfied with this App. Just want to make it even better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in the lack of commentary","review":"Bible is OK however the commentary is lacking.

That might be an unfair comparison (although I don't know why when you have Douglas Moo as the General Editor of the NIV2011 translation), but the ESVSB is now the mark of what we should expect from from all study bibles. If you are not going to be at that level, why even bother?For those who love the NIV, I would not recommend this SB at all.

Remember this is a \\"study Bible\\" so there is a TON of extra information and maps. Almost too much but definitely better than not enough.Back to the leather. It is top-grain so we are not talking plastic here; however, it does not have that look and feel that would develop that well-worrn patina that a fine leather acquires over years of use.

Like the others, my husband (who is a born engineer who has missed his calling) was the only one able to figure out how to open the clock door, we think the phone cord is WAY too short, the letters/numbers are too difficult for a 30-year-old mom to push through their respective slots, and overall the toy is colorful but very BLAH. We also would have spent more on an expensive activity cube that will last as well as entertain. This toy sits in the corner and is rarely used by my daughter or any of her playdates.

I agree with everything everyone else has said about it. It came with no directions. Someone finally figured out how to open the door to the clock. My kids ripped the door off and it disappeared. The beads are too big for the maze. The shapes only fit into the sorter if you have a mechanical engineering degree. The twirly thing doesn't do anything. And, we can't figure out how to make the music start. Sometimes the thing makes music, and sometimes it doesn't. I put it away for a year and just brought it out for the kids to play with. They were so excited one hour ago and now are already frustrated with it and are throwing it off of things. Also, I opened the door to replace the batteries for the very first time, and now the screw won't hold the door shut and I had to tape it shut.

It's a space hog, and the kids play with it enough that they would notice and be disappointed if it just disappeared. The paint is chipping off the letters, and they aren't a great fit into the holes anyway. The parts where the bead-like things slide on the tubes (sorry, I can't describe it well!) are too close to one another for my son to manuveur them easily. The phone cord is too short to really use it as a phone. (A friend who has an older version of this toy said that there is no cord attaching their phone, so I'm thinking about just cutting it.) Parts get stuck all the time, which is usually when my kids get bored with it.We love other toys from Parents (whose name is on this) and it's a good magazine, but this one just doesn't measure up.

First, it presents in English the Pirke Avot, the Chapters of the Fathers, an ancient collection of the favorite sayings of the great Talmudic Sages. Second, it presents selected commentary on these sayings. The commentary is very helpful and ranges in date from 200 C.E. to more than 1200 C.E. (common era). Although these are the sayings of famous Jewish sages, almost all of them will be appealing and sensible to Christians, Moslems, Buddhists, Hindus, and Confucists. This is a must for students of comparative religion."},{"rating":"1","title":"This simply is not Judith McNaught!!!!","review":"I just cannot believe that the same woman who wrote Paradise and Perfect could have wrote this book.

Did I miss something?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book lacked the basic requirement needed: passion.","review":"I have read several books written by Judith McNaught, however, this book did not live up to the standards. The storyline did not start until the middle of the book. When the plot started to unfold it was very weak. It did not captivate me at all. The love scenes were very short and dry. This is not what I would have expected after reading Paradise and Whitney, my love."},{"rating":"1","title":"This novel did not focus on the characters.","review":"It was my idea that this novel would focus on the emotions of the characters. Instead, it detailed the business aspect of their lives. The best part of the book is the beginning, when we are drawn into Diana's life. The latter part of the novel loses the depth of the characters as it details the superficial aspect of their lives. The repetition about how Diana and Cole became successful tends to emotionally distance the reader from the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"a somewhat disappointing read for a J McNaught fan","review":"First time readers: Her other books are MUCH better.

I kept checking if it was written by Ms McNaught, it was THAT bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not McNaught's best...not even mediocre!","review":"This was not a romance. It was too much detail about the secondary characters. She wrote so much about everyone that you did not have time to really like any of them, especially Diana and Cole. Everything worked out too easily for them. It was not like Perfect or Whitney, My Love! It was not worth purchasing the hardcover. I will be more cautious the next time"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definatly not one of her best","review":"I read this and was shocked that McNaught could produce such a low quality of writing. This looked like something a highschooler might write, but not Judith. What usually gets me about McNaught books is that I get really mad at them. During this one, I didn't. Her books usually make me feel like I've never felt before, but I have felt the emotion this book made me feel... bored. My first McNaught book I read was Perfect, and that's turned out as my favorite. If any of you have read that book, you've probably gotten very mad at it. That's what I love about McNaught. You can be mad one minute, and extremely happy the next. This book didn't give any of that out. I was VERY dissapointed. Where did her creativity go?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid and boring","review":"I can't believe this is one of Judith McNaught's works. There was no tension, no top of the action, everything was flat and went on and on ... and nothing really happened. Too much space wasted on secondary characters, no chemistry between Cole and Diana, no romance - I still don't know why, when or how they fell in love. Sometimes I had a feeling the translation was shortened, because I found so many things missing (Cole: \\"remember when I said ...\\" and he DIDN'T say it during the plot!), but after reading all reviews here I understood McNaught had written this book this awful way. I thought I wasn't going to finish it. I did and now say: please miss this one and if you want real McNaught, read some historical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clearly her worst yet.","review":"This book was so boring it took forever to finish it. It lacked the passion and energy found in her other books. Not one to be bought for keeps."},{"rating":"1","title":"J.M.'s worst ever!!!!!!!!!","review":"I absolutely loathed this book. It was awful. Don't get me wrong, I love Judith McNaught and have read all of her books (Paradise is my all-time favorite romance), but there was just no redeeming this book. Diana was okay in some ways ( she was a bit wimpy for my taste), but I found Cole to be completely reprehensible. He was arrogant, domineering, and just downright unlikeable. Most of Judith's heroes usually display an arrogance and ruthlessness that can make them quite disagreeable at times, but they are usually given a wonderful quality that redeems them (in Matt's case, it was his sensitivity and understanding; most of her other heroes have similar qualities.) Cole did not. He came off as cold and ruthless to the end. I just never warmed up to him. Judith could have done much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remember when McNaught used to.........","review":"write romances of quality? This definitely was a major disappointment for me! I used to read romances till I got tired of all the same plots with their oh-so predictable endings. I decided to give romance another try when \\"Remember When\\" came into the market. Needless to say, it will be a long long time till I pick-up another romance novel. This book was such a big disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Something Wonderful \\"Remember When\\" Is Not!","review":"Shame on the publisher for letting this go to press! Is this the best that McNaught can produce after several years? Readers willing to invest the money in books deserve the highest quality from a writer. This book was mediocre at best and failed abysmally to evoke any emotions toward Diana and Cole. Their young years took up a major portion of the book--who cares? when it isn't evident that Cole reciprocates Diana's feelings then"},{"rating":"1","title":"New readers- Do not judge Mcnaught by this book!","review":"Remember When was an extremely disappointing read. I have been a die hard Mcnaught fan ever since reading Something Wonderful and Perfect. This author is one of the most incredibly talented romance novelists ever but Remember When was not up to standard. The plot was slow moving and the characters annoying. It was impossible to care about the romance because Diana and Cole fell in love without any explanation at all. Similar to other reviewers, I also felt the description of Diana's family and the running of Foster's Home Living got boring to the point of being tedious. I would not give such a harsh review if I had not already experienced the spectacular quality of Mcnaught's earlier writings. I am just waiting for Judith Mcnaught to write another mesmerizing tear-jerker that I know she is capable of. First time readers should definitely check out Something Wonderful, Almost Heaven, and Perfect!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Exception to the Rule","review":"I have only been reading Judith McNaught books for a short time... although in that time I have read almost all of them. They are like yummy candy for the heart. I don't know what happened with this one, but Remember When was aweful. I thought I was reading another author. Boring beyond measure. I forced myself to finish it but it wasn't worth the time. If you really must see for yourself, get it from the library... you'll be glad you did. If this was my first McNaught novel it would have been a real shame because I wouldn't have read anything else. As it stands, this book is the exception. Everything else I have read by her has been amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Complete, Enjoyable, and Fullfilling","review":"This book left very little for the reader to complain about. Simply put, the book kept me turning pages in anticipation of what was to come. I enjoyed the story immensely.Diana was a charming heroine and it was refreshing to read about a ladylike girl who trusts her man, her instincts, and herself. I didn't get the impression she was \\"too perfect.\\" She was who she was. There ARE nice, good-looking people in the world. I enjoyed Cole's character more as a cowboy than a CEO of a huge corporation, but I still enjoyed nearly every aspect of the story. I agree with another reviewer who said we waited throughout the novel for Diana and Cole to get together and once we reached that point it was almost anti-climatic. I would have preferred more scenes, detail, and dialogue between the two.The only other book I read by this author was PARADISE. I like REMEMBER WHEN better but they were both great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Pleasant Read","review":"This is my second Judith McNaught novel. This is a very good book I really like the way the book explores family relationship between Diana and Corey and Cole. Then traces the characters as adults. I was pleasantly surprised it had me moved to tears. I highly recommend to anyone. Cole coming to Diana rescue was priceless."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Judith McNaught book","review":"This is the first novel by Judith McNaught that I've ever read and I highly enjoyed it very much. In fact I still reread it whenever I can. This led me to read other Judith McNaught's book such as Paradise which I recommend greatly. I loved Cole and Diana."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST BOOK OF ALL TIMES!","review":"How could anyone be this hateful to Judith McNaught! The characters are wonderful and keep you interested. Cole is a dark and handsome man who keeps you loving him because you know what he thought of Diana from their childhood. Diana is melted by every word that comes out of Cole's mouth, and who could blame her. He is a very sexy man. This book is great, and I recommend it to every reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABOUT AS ENGAGING AS PLAIN OATMEAL---","review":"Rather like a bland puzzle with a few pieces missing. This story seemed to drone on and on without really saying anything. Certainly not up to Judith McNaught's usual standards, more on the line of a generic harlequin-type romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super Boring.......Yawn","review":"I love Judith's historical romances such as Whitney My Love and Once & Always, so I thought I'll give her modern setting romances a try. Boy! So disappointed!The story was super boring, with characters that were flat and forgettable. The writing and dialogues made me nearly fell asleep. It just went on and on talking about the characters' businesses blah blah blah. Hey, this is suppose to be a romance, not some 100 ways to run business or get rich self help book! Talking about romance, there was hardly any sparks between the characters. Theirs was just so simple, so convenient, so smooth, so dull.The only reason I forced myself to finish this book was because I've paid for the rental of this book from a book rental shop, and wanted to get the full worth. This book has really diminished my interest in her other modern romances."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT start here...","review":"As you all know McNaught is one of; if not my number one author... So with that said I have to give this book a low rating. I felt like \\"Remember When\\" was a lazy write and it mirrored (almost exactly) one of her other books. I will say it started out as a \\"could not put it down read\\", but somewhere around the middle it fell apart. I know she can bring more than this to the table and that's why this review is so negative. If you've never read McNaught DO NOT start with this one. Try \\"A Kingdom of Dreams\\", \\"Paradise\\" or \\"Almost Heaven\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really horrible","review":"I've never read a McNaught book before, but I've always wondered whether or not I would enjoy one of her books....well, now I know. This was a sad waste of my time.The characters were not well-developed at all. They were like cardboard cutouts of what romance novels characters should be...like a novel that makes fun of romances. Too much of the novel was dedicated to scenes that had nothing to do with the interaction between the main characters, as if this book was trying to NOT concentrate on the romance. Yet, this is a romance novel, so it didn't make the least amount of sense. Either write a romance or don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"She's losing her touch","review":"I was very disappointed with Remember When as well as her previous book Until You. I am really starting to worry that we won't be seeing any more stories out of Ms. McNaught that meet the standard she set with Perfect, Paradise and Almost Heaven. The romance as well as the male lead were terribly underdeveloped. I miss her longer books where the romance and characters were so fully explored."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE, REALLY. . . .","review":"This from the woman who brought us \\"Perfect\\" and \\"Until You\\"? Ugh. The plot makes no sense. And what was that \\"Rosemary's Baby\\" scene? Cole, if he were a sensible man, would have dropped Diana like a hot coal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not McNaught's best book","review":"This was not a terrible reading, but because I had high hopes for McNaught's books, it was disapointing. If you her other books (Paradise, Once and Always for example), you'll see what I mean. I didn't get me hooked as her previous books did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remember When--","review":"I used to be Mcnaught #1 fan and would buy anything with her name on it. But after reading this disaster, not anymore!!! Next time I'll take take the book out of my library first to make sure its worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writing was confusing and disjointed","review":"The first half of the book which describes Diana's childhood and the beginnings of her friendship with Cole is solid and cohesive. Alas, when the story fast-forwards a few years, the writing falls apart and the characters' actions don't make sense in many instances. From the moment Diana and Cole decide to marry for the sake of convenience, the pacing of the story is accelerated to the point where the story loses all realism. For example, Diana does and says some silly things which are never fully explained. This book gave me the impression that the author must have been very distracted while writing it because it certainly comes across in the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Judith McNaught's usual standard.","review":"Judith McNaught is not one of the more prolific writers, so when she has a new novel come out (in paperback) I eagerly buy and read it. While many people felt it was not worth the price of a hardcover, I thought it was not even worth the price of a paperback. Ms McNaught told us more about the main character's family than I really cared to know in the first place, but then she kept telling us more and more of the same information about this family. When she finally got the two supposedly main characters together, almost three forths of the way through the book, they fall into bed togther and guess what? All their problems were solved! I think McNaught developed the relationship between Diana and her stepsister more than the relationship between Diana and Cole, the hero. And frankly, by the time she finally got Diana nad Cole together, I really didn't care any longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of My favorites EVER","review":"I am amazed when I read some of the more questionable reviews of this book. I know we all love \\"Paradise\\" and Matt and Meredith are the backbone of Ms. Mcnaughts stories, but I loved the way this story began, with a sweet young girl, to a determined, grown woman. I do not agree that Diana is TOO PERFECT, in fact, I think she is actually flawed... which makes her more real! I believe this one is my favorite of all of her contemporary novels. It is the most realable to me personally... LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent book","review":"I've read many of McNaughts books; Regency England & modern day included. If you're used to historical romance this will be VERY different-you might not like it. I enjoy both historical & modern day. Remember When is my favorite McNaught book. She really took the time to fully develop the characters here. The beginning of the book delves deeply into Diana's teen years & Cole's college years. This portion of the book is slower reading but it's very important to the rest of the book. The main characters genuinely LIKE each other; aside from being physically attracted, there is mutual respect between them. Their relationship has more substance than what we see in MANY, MANY other romance novels. Cole is a very intelligent guy who's company is trying to develop some really cool technology-you'll find out toward the end-and these two have no stupid misunderstandings which cause them to hurt each other."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of McNaught's Worst...","review":"Judith McNaught, an excellent romance writer, has kept us on tenterhooks, waiting for the next novel to come out. Only the wait turns out to be for nothing. Remember When is mediocre compared to that of her other novels. The book pays to much detail to the relationship between younger Diana and Cole which takes up half the novel. This is unnessary since their budding friendship could be summed up in two chapters. The end left me lacking and unsatisfied. This book is not one of her better ones..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remember When? Forget it NOW!","review":"A stupid book - the worst kind of romance novel...absolutely trite. How about text like:\\" He was motorcyles and blue jeans and battered duffel bags with the need to blaze his own trails through life...She was BMWs and prom gowns and matched luggage, with a need to stay on smooth paved roads,\\" I tried to finish the book, thinking maybe it was a parody or that it would take a completely bizarre twist. I couldn't force myself to get past page 81. Don't waste your time reading this like I wasted mine...there's simply nothing there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow! I didn't think a book this bad could ever be published!","review":"Is this really the same author of Paradise and a gaggle of great historical romances? Or is an evil, synonymously named doppelganger polluting the bookstores? The characters were pathetically one-dimensional and the relationships were poorly developed and written. Oh, I guess it is the same author since this book's one trait common to McNaught's previous works is the annoying habit of idealizing the lifestyles of the rich and famous. Unfortunately, this book lacks both the characterization and wit to fill the glittering void."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing! Expected much more","review":"I was very disappointed when i read this book, i was cravingfor another \\"Paradise\\" and instead read a book that had noneof the passion and love that was in Judith's earlier novels. The main character \\"Cole\\" didn't even come close to \\"Matt\\", and I can count the number of pages that was dedicated to the leading characters only. I'll say it again, if you want to read a great book read \\"Paradise\\"!! my all time favourite, i suppose i should stop comparing other books to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!!!","review":"This book was terrible. I bought it at the cover price thinking it would definitely be worth the extra money. It wasn't. I kept waiting for things to get better, but i was gravely mistaken. The characters and the plot were mediocre at best. The love story, drama, and suspense were not even worth commenting about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe she has set the bar too high for herself...","review":"First let me say that I am a big JM fan. She is my favorite romance writer. I love almost all of her books. But this one wasn't nearly as good as any of her others. The characters were very underdeveloped and they did totally bizaar things and acted as if it were the most normal thing in the world. It started out with real promise and could have been so much better. But even if she had added more the story line was just too unrealistic. I found myself skipping paragraphs just to finish it which is something I rarely ever do. I think she really dropped the ball with this one. But maybe I am judging it too harshly; I guess there can never be another Matt and Meredith..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"I have loved Judith McNaught ever since I read Whitney, My Love. She is my favorite author because she lets you see the feelings develop and deepen between her characters. None of that was evident in this novel. As a love story, it is forced and abrupt. We have no understanding of why and how they fell in love. The only saving grace of this book are the other characters that carry the book through. It does not read like one of McNaught's works at all. I wasted money buying this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"Gosh, I was skipping pages this book is so boring. The character are not portrayed consistently throug out the book. Diana Foster was supposedly this very proud, hardworking, socially graceful person yet she gets totally wasted and go get married in Las Vegas...??? Then, Cole was not looking for love but said I love you after a short time, a man who was bored with these \\"other\\" women, can't be tied down, just became so enchanted with Diana again? Just so far from reality, it's so out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT!!!!","review":"The story of the two young girls growing up and becoming women was wonderful. You could see the strength of Diana even as a young girl. And the devotion of the family to one another was very heartwarming. It leaves you with a smile and a warm feeling and has you remembering when. It was the first book I had read by this author but it won't be the last!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"remember when...","review":"This was the best Judith McNaught book I've read!! I just loved the story and the characters. Although it lacked the passion and intensity that her other novels had, this one had a tenderness that the others lacked. I especially liked how *Remember When* began with Diana and Cole as teenagers with a slowly developing friendship, despite their differences in lifestyles. (For those who wonder when the two fell in love, maybe you should consider re-reading that first part.) I have to admit, Diana was a bit weak when compared with the heroines in McNaught's other novels, but paired with Cole, they were just perfect! This book wasn't passionate, but it was sweet. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that Cole never tells Diana he loves her even once. Some of my favorite scenes were those during the White Orchid Ball when Cole comes to Diana's rescue. Chivalry really does still exist! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"it's not ...WOW!... but a ok read","review":"This was my fourth Judith Mcnaught book, while reading it I thought it was ok a good read its not like that WOW! feeling you get when a book is mind blowing like her other books PARADISE, PERFECT and WHITNEY MY LOVE. I'm not saying it should be like those books because if all her books were the same with the same plot it would be boring, for me personally it was a simple, nice cuddle in bed read.The characters were great as always in her books, because as i said before you get to know her characters and you get to feel like your apart of their life and Diana's family was just so wonderful. Cole and Diana together it was fun growing up with them and having them finding each other some years later REMEBERING WHEN........If you decide to read this book i hope you enjoy it, it maybe ok but its still a good read and well written as the author shows her signature style writting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anita blake series","review":"I always read vampire novels growing up, then age hit me and a baby as well and you know life kind of gets in the way. Long story short a friend of mine suggested i start reading the Anita Blake series from Laurell K. Hamilton. OMG i fell in love, Anita kicks butt in this series and wow i can just imagine the soft dark curls of Jean Claude...this could be a movie in the future. I will buy tickets!! I highly recommend these books, i just could not put them down. I am on the fourth book and just ordered 8 more in the series so i should get them next week! Whoo hoo! Then off to seek the merideth gentry series. I just cant get enough of Laurell she is a wonderful writer, she is able to take you from your everyday life and open my eyes to a wonderful fantasy world all about butt kicking and romance, with a little gore in between. LOL Thank you Laurell! Please keep them coming!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Series Sucks (Pun Intended)","review":"Of all the vampire series this one is not worth the money I spent on this boxed set. I hated Anita Blake. Anita is not someone worth wanting to find out about. So I didn't. She doesn't measure up to heroines in other vampire series.Stephanie Meyers' Twilight Series - FAB, the book that started it all. Edward or Jacob? Both for me.L. J. Smith's Vampire Diaries - Pretty good. Good enough to have a TV series.Melissa De La Cruz Blue Bloods - Excellent. The most unique twist on the vampire lore that I have read so far.J. R. Ward's Black Dagger Brotherhood - Exciting. Who wouldn't want one of these brothers to have your back.Charlaine Harris' Sookie Stackhouse - Quirky and fun. Even better than True Blood (although some would disagree).Then there is Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake - truly bites (in a bad way). I could not get past the first 50 pages. If you don't have my attention by the first few chapters, its not worth reading. Sorry, just my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snoozeville","review":"Before I went out and bought this set, I decided it wise that I borrowed the books from the library. THANK GOD I DIDN'T WASTE MY MONEY! These books are so boring. The woman (Anita Blake) is so manly I can't stand it. I'm not one to read romance novels, but geez this is ridiculous. It's like she's just this manly-gun-carrying-constantly woman that doesn't even give a second glance to men until the 3rd or 4th books. It's just full of chaos up until those books. If you're into guns and constant action these are the books for you. I must be a girly girl because it seemed like too much and wore me out.

I wasn't disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining, And The Series Continues to Get Better","review":"The first four books in the Anita Blake series define the main characters that will continue to be highlighted in her later books. These four do not have the wicked eroticism of her later ones, which are blushingly descriptive. I urge anyone into the horror/mystery/romance genre to read all the books she has published in this series. Hamilton's writing style improves with each one and she does not disappoint with her plot twists and character development.

Items of interest are noted in the text and on the map with a circled number, so it is really easy to find items on the map.

It is his style of presentation, and his relish in clever turns of phrase, that has put him into a Canadian human rights commission's kangaroo court.

Awareness of what Islam represents and what the dangers are to the free world escapes most citizens of the USA. The author holds back no punches and his analyses of the coming effects on European cultures is in-depth, to the point, and extremely clear. Having travelled to Europe (France, Sweden, Romania, Lithuania,and Latvia)in 2007 I can look back now and realize I saw evidence for many of the various predictions he has made. He's right on when he says most Europeans and many Americans are so caught up in pursuing government hand-outs that they fail to realize how this dependancy eats away at the very fabric of our western civilization.

Slowly, but going nonetheless.I already knew that, but I didn't know how bad it was getting around the rest of the world. Statistics are statistics; they just are. We in the West are not reproducing. We are below replacement rates. It IS funny to hear folks complain about overpopulation when there is none, at least not here.

We are in the midst of the free world (the infidels) vs Islam, and it's not a war that we easily see. It is far beyond Bush and Iraq. Non-Muslim people are scared to be in their neighborhoods unless they are dressed in full Muslim attire. Why is the media scared to admit the \\"youth\\" in France were Muslim?

If you appreciate the choices and freedoms we have now, you will read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fraud, propaganda","review":"Steyn does not give his sources or statistics for obvious reasons : his statements on the actual birthrates of European Muslims are fabrications. The Muslim population in Europe is slightly more than 4% and its fertility rates are similar to the \\"native\\" Europeans at the second or third generation. Immigration in Europe was brought down to much more controlled rates in recent years. Real demographic data that completely invalidates Steyn's thesis can be found at Princeton (Religiousness and Fertility among European Muslims by CHARLES F.

As some may know, Schmidtt was influential (especially in his critique of liberalism) in both National Socialist circles and in neo-conservative circles.This is a re-hashing of Huntington, only Steyn is even more alarmist and pessimistic (who could have thought it was possible) in his 'prophetic' (read sarcasm) judgments.

These pages should have been summarized and many more pages should have been devoted to expanding upon the the excellent list of 10 things we can do to counter the various threats we face. The list takes up only two pages (205 and 206).

If what he predicts comes about, we are in for some terrible times. However, accustomed as I am to short term thinking I realize that what he predicts will probably not affect me personally. We seem never to be short of people ready to make predictions of terrible things to come but history tells us that we usually address these problems prior to the event. I'm old enough to remember when Charles Lindbergh and Joseph Kennedy decided that we could not defeat Hitler and we, as a nation, were destined to live as Fortress America and would be foreced to abandon all of our western european allies. Wait and see. All these countries Mr. Steyn is concerned about will pass laws regulating the influence of religion, especially Islam, before they take over. I do recommend this book.

Please take the time to read this book!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Facts and Figures, Coolheaded Panic","review":"Mark Steyn names names, dates, and places, and delivers boatloads of grim statistics. This is an apocalyptic book that is probably right. Since he can back it up with good factual information, he can afford to be coolheaded, erudite, and wry -- even funny -- whilst predicting the demographic, economic, sociopolitical tsunami that is certainly going to crash into Europe. It is his wish that America will respond, demographically, before the tsunami hits us."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMERICA.....watch out ....ISLAM is coming here and it's scary","review":"Mark has written a unusually candid portrait of ISLAM as it is spreading throughout the world, especially among those who feel weak, the \\"havenots\\", and jealous of the \\"haves\\", who will be converted.

His vision for the future is both worrisome and visionary. The demographic data indicates that our Euro friends have gone a little too far metrosexual and are not keeping up with the more productive groups, perhaps too much tv and too many video games for the real thing.His vision of America Alone is not that of the \\"rogue nation\\" that some talk of but rather America as the surviving bastion of Western Civilization.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye-opener","review":"America let's wake up!

This is a great quick read and I really enjoyed Steyn's writing style, in spite of the alarming information."},{"rating":"2","title":"america alone","review":"This is a wonderful book, very well written and with just about the right amount of humor to make demography and politics and the shoddy islamic politics seem interesting. Plus there's enough immediacy to take the current state of affairs seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pulls no punches!","review":"Steyn presents an honest and factual description of the world-wide growth of fundamental Islam, presenting the demographic data in a clear, if not comforting, manner.The message is, at least to me, the fact that what Islam could not achieve by warfare against Christian Europe during the Middle Ages, it is now achieving by a substantial differential birth rate. Only the United States is (barely) holding its own in this respect. Future projections appear bleak for all of the Western powers.While Steyn does an admirable job in describing this situation and all of the related consequences, his suggestions for positive actions that can be made by democratic governments are few, primarily related to the elevation of the status of Moslem women in some manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Objectivity and Insight","review":"A real, honest and objective look at the future of this country.Read this along with a phenomenal book called \\"How The Left Was Won\\" by Richard Mgrdechian and begin see the world for what it really is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep Thoughts to Ponder","review":"\\"America Alone\\" brings the reader to bear deep thoughts and contemplations on our role in the 21st century. While the first half of this book is resplendent with statistics, the second half is lighter reading with an eye towards unabashed optimism. I enjoyed the statistical renderings by Mark Steyn; most do have a bottom line. His writing style is reminiscent of Ring Lardner; humor can convey a deeper, more serious underlying form of communication to the reader. Although parts of this book are laugh-out-loud hilarious, the reader must remember that there is a grave danger to our great country that is now present in Europe and Asia. I have recommended this book with great acceptance to my friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scary is Right!","review":"I bought this book from Amazon on the advice of a friend whom I thought was fairly enlightened and then I read it with horror - horror at the simplistic and ignorant text before me. I didn't find his \\"facts\\" scary. I found the reviews scary. I had to read the first 50 reviews, all 5 star, until I came to a wonderful review by a person who actually knows the Moslem world. He gave it one star and came close to vilifying Mark Steyn, something I am willing to do.If those positive reviews are how America thinks, no wonder we have enemies. They are scary, scary. And war mongering. Apparently they do want to end the world as we know it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Standard neocon drivel","review":"He rambles on about Germany as typical of technically moribund Europe. In 2006, Germany's exports exceeded those of the mighty US by more than $100 million. And Germany's were machinery, electronics, chemical products, etc, not corn and soybeans.He offers no solutions except maybe a return to the Crusades where we slaughter Muslims right and left, not to mention getting tough with Iraqis. He didn't identify which of the factions there, or all of them, he wants to show who is boss. Steyn, Rummy, and Bush - we won't have an asset left with them in charge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding ! 10**** on a scale 1-5","review":"This is absolutely the best book I've read on the subject of the threat of the Middle East. It's mind boggling to think what's been going on in Europe, but it's more provocative to realize the same thing could happen here. Wake up America! ~ That's what Mark Steyn's trying to tell us. The fact will remain whether we've become so politically correct that we'll fail to pay attention to the message and end up with no freedoms at all! Thank you, Mark Steyn, for writing this wonderfully enlightening and entertaining book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BRILLiANT!","review":"You don't have to agree with Mark Steyn to enjoy this book. This was the most entertaining political book I've ever read. The writing is witty, inciteful, and addictive, and just for entertainment value, this book is well worth it. But that's not all! You get some brilliant observations on the state of our world today. And you have to laugh at the lame reviews who simply label him a racist. Clearly they never read the book and have no interest in its actual contents. But this politically correct, multiculturalist dogma which has reduced political debate in the west to name calling and labels will be the death of us. Like Mark Steyn himself says, radical Islam really doesn't threaten conservatives. Just get a few more wives, grow a beard, and life goes on. It's the pot-smoking bi-sexuals in Holland who should really wake up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Put down whatever other geo-political book your reading, it can wait till after you've read this masterpiece","review":"Stunningly succint. The insight and original thoughts per paragragh is mind boggling. The guy is amazing.He labels, characterizes, and dissects all that is suicidal for Western Culture.The primary impulse vs secondary impulse for governments is spot on.His demography breakdown is in-depth, and yes, scary as hell, especially if you have kids. You thought Mayberry is gone now, you ain't seen nuthin.His humor is great too, as well as the brit vernacular which every American finds endearing. Heh.I already have a small waiting list of people ready to read this book after me. If you're not on a waiting list, order and read asap."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"This book is a must read for all those concerned about our freedoms and our future- a real wake-up call.

There are no convoluted pretentious ramblings in this book--just straight to the brain common sense that will shock you with its honest clarity. And soooo hilarious!!As fuzzy-wuzzy therapists say: Do something nice for yourself. Read this book--reads like suspenseful fiction, and your mind will feel more detoxed than after a gallon of green tea and spring water. But here's my advice, we all need to get our self absorbed heads out of our rear ends and learn the truth about what will happen to us if we don't grow up and get tough---so buy this book--you will not regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wake up time for the United States - We WILL be alone","review":"This is a view of the likely future based largely on demographical trends in the Western World.

This book will appeal to anybody who belongs to a local militia who think that the Federal Government , Canada , Europe , 1.5 Billion Muslims and basically anybody who is not a paranoid hate filled American sterotype are out to destroy their freedoms .It is so far to the right that it just dumps reason and goes with everybody is against us , so lets kill them . Solve the problem of insurgents crossing into Iraq from Syria by planting bombs in Syria there by teaching them a lesson .What is really frightening is that a lot of the hate is ' read between the lines ' .

Take shopworn conservative dreams and dogmas, spice them up with fahionable (Islam-)hysteria and oversalt it with delusions of grandeur and hyperbolic patriotism - and this is what you get. Excites the taste buds, but leaves a stale aftertaste: does he really mean this seriously? I am afraid, for some part he does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inflammatory, poorly reasoned, not worth time to read","review":"In my opinion, this book is racist, misogynist trash wholly unworthy of any thinking person's reading time. Steyn premises this book on fundamentalist theocon generalizations and stereotypes about Middle Eastern peoples and then invents wildly improbable \\"demographics\\" to bolster his conclusions. Johann Hari put it best when he said \\"Europe cannot defeat the far-right poison of Islamic fundamentalism by turning to a parallel far-right mythology of its own. Once before we logged the race of babies. Once before we invented conspiracies like the Protocols of the Elders of Mohammed peddled by Steyn.

Likely not, because Romans slid into their collapse mostly asleep at the wheel. We (the West), though, have this brilliant man to keep pinching us into lucidity, so perhaps we'll make a longer go of keeping the monsters of the Middle East out of our lands.

Myles, if you're going to write a book on the Kingdom of God, use the Bible as research material. It clearly teaches that NOT all religions are \\"a result of man's attempt to respond to his desire to find some type of meaningful, and possibly intimate, relationship with a Supreme Being\\" (pg. 18), instead, the Bible teaches that Judeo Christian religions were initiated by Jehovah God.

As another user mentioned, you can create playlists of related recordings that can later be burned to CD-Rom.Two drawbacks for me are the volume level of iTalk's speaker, which I find too low for adequate playback even at top volume on my iPod, and the lack of a carrying case to protect and identify the iTalk in my purse.Would I buy again?

Unless you hold your iPod directly up to what you want to record, it picks up virtually nothing. The external mic jack is nice, but if I plug my headphones into it, the playback quality is dreadful even on existing songs & whatnot.

A direct line recording from my line out would be stuttered and useless. I never got a good recording from this device. Both the microphone and line in jack would record at the same time, filling my clean line recordings with noise from the mic. Finally, after just a few days, the iPod borked out.

It was drawn out and boring. It is about a young man who is obsessed with a married woman. Werther is whiny and unlikeable in my opinoin. The book is a collection of letters he has written to his friend. The letters consist of his bellyaching about his unrequited love. I found Werther to be irritating and was quite apathetic to his plight. Thumbs down. I do not recommend this book, but apparently many others do."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best translation of Goethe's Werther","review":"If you want to know why Goethe became so famous - well, read this book, because this is the small novel that created his fame throughout Europe within just a few months.

It really is that good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marred by poor OCR","review":"I bought the Penguin-branded Kindle eBook, paying a premium over the other, cheaper editions, and got exactly what I feared from a cheap product: poor typesetting (it's not clear where blockquotes begin and end), frequent errors in the OCR (\\"diick\\" instead of \\"duck\\", \\"litde\\" instead of \\"little\\"), and no table of contents whatsoever.The text is readable, if requiring of some riddle-solving (Oh, \\"sympadiy\\" is \\"sympathy\\"), and has the obligatory footnoting from the print version (most of which are mere cross-references than actual, helpful notes). I don't know what the cheaper editions are like, but I'd take the risk next time, since the Penguin brand apparently means nothing in Kindle books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Werther teaches what young men strive to learn","review":"When The Sorrows of Young Werther was first published, young men threw themselves to their death over beautiful girls. The impact this novel had on the perception of love and romance is no mystery to one who reads it with an open mind and heart. The modern reader hears the term 'classic' and shudders. IF it is not appropriate 'beach' or 'airplane' reading, the novel becomes a relic - confined to the dusty basements of our interest. Werther transcends time with his undying eccentricism. He takes romanticism to its exmplosive, eccentric limit. He is the struggling poet in us all, brought out by forces we do not understand - by a visage of beauty so stunning it blinds us to our own good senses. Who hasn't felt this? Who has not desired to feel this? We could do far worse than to pick up young Werther as he embarks on his travels. To accompany him is to accept a part of ourselves that is not 'contemporary' or 'modern.' A part that simply: is."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"I must be missing something.

We find that it is NOT A TRAGIC LOVE STORY, but rather a story of a depressed, diluted individual completely disconnected from reality. Werther is too full his own virtue and cannot grasp the reality of his relationship to Charlotte. Werther's reaction to the events of his life are too emotional and over-dramatized. As we would say in German, ER IST VERRUECKT!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my gosh.","review":"This book is absolutely BORING!! I can't believe almost everyone (or is it just everyone?) rated this book as 5 full stars! First, I don't get it, second, Werther is somewhat pahychotic, and third, this book has no plot. Therfore, no climax, which is the most important part of a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best German love story","review":"Gothe's \\"The Sorrows of Young Werther\\" is not only the best German love story, but also an excellent criticism of the society of this time. He shows the stiffness and decadence of the nobilty in the 18th century, nestling among a wonderful love story. No wonder, that so many young commoners of this time made suicide after reading this book. Allthough the time has changed a lot, the basics of cristicism of the German society, especially about the German petit-bourgeois and inflexibility, is still relevant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad and anger inducing","review":"This is the only work by Goethe I have yet read. While the story was very interesting and you can't help but feel for Werther I found myself angry at him in the end. Doing what he did and then orchestrating it such that others have to live the rest of their life feeling guilty for it (I am trying not to give away too much here) is horrible. He fell in love with someone that wasn't \\"available\\" and then he spirals downward and ultimately blames the other person for their unavailability. Like all good works of literature the story doesn't necessarily tell you how to feel. It doesn't raise Werther up as either a hero or a villain (though I get wafts of the former). I walked away feeling like he was a villain, but enjoyed the story nonetheless and would recommend it to anyone who likes well written literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much","review":"The ideals and romanticism of Werther are so exaggerated that they're almost unbelievable. I thought Britain's 19th century Romantics were emotional . . . Goethe, in 1774, is 'worse'! I could not sympathize with Werther in the least; he was quite annoying with his incessant tears and sighs. Werther seems to me merely a kamakazi-like lover who opts a coward's end. Also, _The Sorrows of Young Werther_ denies the reader a full portrait of characters like Wilhem, Lotte, and big-man Werther himself. A quite disappointing novella for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow~","review":"This book is absolutly fascinating; I could'nt put it down when I started it...because the storeyline is so interesting but also tragic..Well, I just really enjoyed the book~"},{"rating":"2","title":"Citizen fan","review":"Keeps great time.

The eco-drive attracted me (no more batteries and I have sworn off kinetic) but the looks on this one are great. The stainless steel really shines and the overall look is very sharp.

It is one of those shows that perhaps should have been filmed while being performed live (ala Sweeney Todd, Into the Woods, etc.). The magic of this show while seeing it live in a small space is that it creates a world out of nothing, and the audience gets totally caught up in it.I couldn't wait to see this film when I heard it was made. It was the first show in which I ever appeared, and I have designed costumes and seen many productions of it. Even the worst ones came across better than this film. I'm crushed.If you have seen this musical on stage anywhere, keep the memory of that magical time and don't bother with this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Fantastick Disappointment","review":"Viewers of films the likes of \\"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum\\" and \\"A Little Night Music\\" will see the trend continue in \\"The Fantasticks.\\" The entire script was reconceived for the screen by the play's original off-Broadway writers, but in this case the script is not at fault. Good performances by stars the calibur of Joel Gray and Bernard Hughes are squelched by director Michael Ritchie. Not only is the intimate charm of the story lost, but the disjointed cutting from locale to locale within single songs left me feeling like Ritchie was severely rushed in slapping this piece together. \\"The Fantasticks\\" does not bode well for the future of the big screen musical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy it!","review":"This vision/interpretation of the beloved Fantasticks is a complete travesty. They've managed to ruin not only the dialog but the music as well. I foolishly ordered the DVD before viewing it. I have since donated it to my local library because that choice marginally outweighed the waste of throwing it in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fantasticks movie version","review":"This is a terrible version of the well known OFF BROADWAY production. The simplicity of the stage production which invites the audience to 'remember, then follow' is completely destroyed by the inexplicable transformation of the characters of El Gallo, The Mute, Mortimer and Henry to performers in a traving circus side show. There are also changes to the music, in an attempt to be 'politically correct', which insult the intelligence of the theater going audience.The copy that I received is flawed and freezes irratically necessitating fast forwarding to the next 'chapter'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could the original have been this bad?","review":"The film version of the Fantasticks was replete with darkness and dullness that only heightened my interest in having it end as soon as possible. I found it hard to believe that the original show, which I had seen live in the 1960's, could have been so lacking in charm and uninteresting. The songs rang out for more intensity, but it never came. And muffled dialogue made the inconsistent staging almost incomprehensible. I am unable even to give it a \\"C\\" grade for cuteness. Too bad they didn't film the stage production."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Nominee for worst movie musical of all time.","review":"A complete and utter stinker. Totally lacking in charm. This show has only one good song: Try to Remember. The other songs are the worst show tunes you will ever hear. The clue should be titles like Plant A Radish and The Rape Song. The cast is dismal. Joe McIntyre has no appeal whatsoever. Where did they dig up this guy? I hope to NEVER see him again. There really isn't a plot: two fathers pretend to have a feud so that their children will get together romantically. The children get together but immediately begin fighting. Something vague happens to them and they wind up together. Huh? Boring! It is sad to see a talented performer like Joel Grey completely wasted in a production this pathetic. The Arizona scenery is kind of nice. Avoid this one like the plague.P. S.

I can't find a way to contact you and get it replaced."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't understand why this is so popular","review":"I have been hearing about this show for many years, about how it is the longest-running off-broadway production ever (just closed last week after 42 years), and the most-staged musical ever, and and the most popular high school production ever, and so on, but I've never managed to actually see it.Now that I have seen it (on DVD), my only response is \\"What on earth does anyone see in this?\\" The story is lame, the music is bad, the lyrics are boring and frequently make no sense, and the characters are practically nonexistent.I'm very happy for the people who love this show, but after seeing this mess, I really have no desire to suffer through it onstage.I would give this 0 stars if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FANTASTICK...","review":"While Michael Ritchie and friends obviously were looking to retain the sweet simplicity of the classic stage play by placing this fable in the open mid-West, with its pure vistas and uncluttered focus, this movie is often terrible. None of the actors are able to convey, through the book or the music, which is badly sung, the magical feeling of the stage show. Nor do they have the empathetic qualities they need. And this musical, which is propelled at all times by its lush, complex and near-perfect musical score and its poignant lyrics, is done a great disservice by the fact that virtually every number has been reorchestrated, cut, butchered and staged in an almost manic look that renders them unintentionally funny when they aren't merely distracting. Run to New York and see the charming little show, which I guarantee will be better sung, full of heart and wistful in all the right places."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have any respect at all for The Fantasticks...","review":"I just finished watching the movie version of The Fantasticks, and I must say that it is among the worst adaptations I have ever seen in my life. Set in middle America, the opening intrigued me... then, after about five minutes it took a turn for the worst and plummeted downhill at an increasingly rapid pace. Many of the songs were either botched or cut completely, along with my favorite character (I'm a little partial because I have played the part), the Mute. Joel Grey was highly enjoyable, along with Jean Louisa Kelly, though they were unable to redeem this completely inadequate version of a wonderful show. In this movie, every shred of quaint theatricality that IS The Fantasticks was removed. If you have any respect at all for the show itself, do NOT bother to see this movie. It will forever taint the memorable style and beautiful simplicity that the show carries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely Evokes the theatrical mastery of its namesake.","review":"I saw this video a few weeks ago and I was astonished. Of course, being a fan of the musical, I should have realized that THE FANTASTICKS is not a property suited to film adaptation. Everything charming and adorable about the Off-Broadway show--that still charms after so many years--has been pushed to the side so that the directors \\"concept\\"--oh so reminiscent of ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN ARE DEAD--may take centerstage. The power of the stage show comes from the actors talking to the audience and inviting the audience into their own little world. On film, that world is thrown at us muddled and uninteresting. And the characters are reconceived! Oh, the horror. Trust me, if you are a fan of the stage show, do not waste your time here. If you have never seen the show and wish to be initiated, it is a toss-up, I guess, but I would not recommend this movie to anyone with taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not \\"Fantastick\\" in the theatre, either","review":"In response to Mr. Haas' review, I saw THE FANTASTICKS in the theatre, and it was no great treat there, either. The idea of setting an extremely intimate in the middle of the prairie, thereby robbing it of its intimacy, is absurd. The script has been completely overhauled, losing its poetry and rhythms. The score has also been slashed, dropping verses and songs (the Fathers' PLANT A RADISH going by the way; a rewrite of lyrics for METAPHOR that manage to drop the metaphors altogether) with abandon. The best parts are Jonathan Tunick's marvelous orchestrations, Joel Gray, and Teller's death scene. All else is faintly embarassing."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Try to Remember\\" the stage play","review":"this dismal little retelling of the charmingly witty off Broadway musical (that ran for over 40 years) fails on all accounts.

The performances here look and sound pretty good, but give you little to love. Superficial. Go find it on a stage, and hope the performances reach beyond camp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"The charm of the play rests in it's intimacy- a pretty, simple metaphorical tale of innocent lost and love realized. This movie destroys the spirit of the play. Old men sport giant plastic breasts, slapstick tries to take the place of witty dialogue and visuals try for \\"updated realism\\". In the pivotal role, Jonathon Morris's hair does more acting than the rest of him. This movie has many sins (cutting the role of narrator, switching and deleted songs, cinematography similar to any number of lifetime movies) but by far the worst is being boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimate Primer on how NOT to bring a classic to the screen","review":"The Fantasticks strength is in the intimate and very theatrical presentation. With a small band and a small house it is at its best. However, when making the move to the screen almost all of what made The Fantasticks the longest running musical is lacking. It is unfortunate, for the location and house sets are almost perfect for the show. But the characterizations are skewed and lacking, and changes made for this movie almost always moves it away from the charming stage classic.Musical numbers are eliminated, and the shows best known song, Try to Remember, is included briefly at the end as an afterthought that it had to be represented.There are some things that work here, and if you have not seen the show you may even enjoy it. But don't expect The Fantasticks that launched a young Jerry Orbach on a long career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some bombs never explode","review":"The film version of this play has so much wrong with it that it's almost easier to say what's right. Here's what's wrong1. Musical cuts make no sense.2. Costumes...Matt looks like a nerdy college professor in a cardigan for half of the film and Pee Wee Herman for the other half.3. The actors playing Matt and Louisa are too old for the roles.4. The first half should be in the moonlight, the second in the light.5. The innocent freshness in the play is completely missing from this version.6. The \\"Bawdy carnival humor\\" adds NOTHING to the story. The only thing that I can think of is that they were afraid of a G rating and wanted to bump it up to a PG13.7. Brad Sullivan CANNOT sing!I look forward to the day when someone will do a film version of the play. This DVD was a complete and total FLOP and disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantasticks butchered","review":"Other reviewers give essential information on the editing of this film. Here's my review: Coppola butchered the thing. The narrative has been stripped of any sub plots, any minor characters, any scenes that would flesh out these few characters and their story. The two lovers acquire the needed hardship to make their love meaningful in so few minutes it's difficult to see before and after differences. After seeing the thing straight through, I went to the deleted scenes and watched each one; many were very short; all were needed. Deleted and shortened songs: unforgivable. Yes, the cinematography is beautiful, casting works, etc. Someone needs to get control of the original of this film and restore its guts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad editing","review":"Release the movie the way the director originally filmed it in 1995, instead of the chopped up version finally released on dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"However enchanting, rather confusing","review":"I have heard glowing reviews about live performances of The Fantasticks, yet when I saw the DVD, I couldn't see the true magic. I suppose you have to see it on a live stage to actually have a thrill, otherwise, I'd never look at it. The movie version must have lost some sparkle in the transfer to the screen. I suggest you see the musical live (which I have never done), and if you truly enjoy it, try the movie. Don't buy the movie and then go see a live show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not 'Fantastick' At All","review":"This movie is in no way \\"The Fantasticks\\" musical theatre fans have come to know and love. With a different cast of kids, an absolutely no cuts, this movie might have been successful. Grey and Sullivan were perfectly cast and should have played the roles onstage together. The role of El Gallo was miscast, but it's Hollywood. The rewrite of \\"Mystery\\" was absolutely horrid and should never be heard again. I thought it was a bad joke. Maybe with a little imagination they could come up with a more suitable \\"Fantasticks\\" for film audiences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shockingly Bad","review":"There was a reason why this film played in theaters for about 5 minutes, people stayed away in record numbers!! Goes into the \\"What Were They Thinking?\\" file. Terribly done, a misguided mess that ruins the score and plot,is totally void of charm. The performances are mediocre , at best. Transposing The Fantastiks to a realistic setting was a huge mistake and robs the audience of it's imagination, which is the key to The Fantastiks success.

Without spoiling too much, Nichols sets up questions that ought to have easy answers, but by playing on the audience's sympathy makes them realize that there are no easy answers for such a difficult topic.Not everything is pitch perfect - the character of Sheila in particular can at times come off-key - but the overall effect is both personal and sublime.

The principle character, Tiffany, reacts to the attentions of her unusual young man with a mixture of natural pleasure and rare good sense. Pratchett weaves this typical teen subject into a beautifully crafted fabric with ancient pagan tales of the progression of the seasons. I bought this book for my daughter with the full intent of reading it myself as I'm a long-time fan of Pratchett's work. Neither of us was disappointed.If you're a Christian parent, as I am, you will definitely want to read Pratchett's work with your children, as you will not agree with everything he says. Tiffany and her friends are witches--I consider this acceptable fantasy, but you may disagree. Aside from that, this book is fairly inoffensive in my view and offers much scope for both laughter and discussion.

In true Pratchett style and humor, the author manages to pull the reader in for remarkable entertainment and read about characters who are developed in even more detail than before.

Granny Weatherwax features prominently in a tale of coming of age, the cycle of the seasons and what it means to be live, die and love. A kid's book for sure. Of course it is. There's stuff tucked away here that people in their 30's wouldn't quite get ... This is more Wicked than Harry Potter with just as much to think about and smile about.If you've given the Wee Free Men a pass since it's for kids, take another look.

I loved the first two books so much, even though they are technically kids' books, but this one doesn't quite work as well as the first two, perhaps because there is a little bit of a sexual subtext to the Wintersmith's pursuit of Tiffany, and as she is only 13, it is a little weird.There are some great plot lines, though, and I have re-read it already, so it is another winner from Terry Pratchett, even if it doesn't reach the sublime heights of the first two books in the series. Would I buy it in hard-cover, knowing what it is like? Yes, as Tiffany is a great role model for young teens, and Pratchett can be so incredibly funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great series. Not the best in it though","review":"Tiffany Aching is one of the great characters in the Terry Pratchett pantheon. While everybody around her is off in that delightful Pratchett kind of way, she is incredibly normal: though she is a witch, and does the most extraordinary things. It's her practicality and intelligence that get her through. She has to be one of the great female characters in young adult literature, though for the life of me, except for the fact of her age, I have no idea why this is considered young adult writing. The series is as brilliant and funny as any of Pratchett's other discworld books: incisive and smart. Unfortunately, this is not quite as funny as the previous two books in the series, but still a very enjoyable read. I look forward to Tiffany's next adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little visits and More little visits with God","review":"When my boys were young and My wife and I were newly born Christians, we purchased these two books. They were loved by our children more than anything else we provided for their Christian growth. Those two books have since disappeared from my library and I am so glad to have found one and I will keep looking for the other. I want them for my Grandchildren and friends. I want them for myself as well! I have never found another pair of books with a short story and devotional thought for each day that fits in so well with a childs everyday living and learning experience. Everyone can relate to each story. Excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book","review":"My mother used to read a story from this book every night before bed from the copy that she had as a child. Now that I have a daughter, this is the first book I went looking for so I can share the same experience with her as I did with my mother. This book is wonderful on teaching lessons, exploring feelings and using stories to show the teachings of Christ in our daily lives. They also have questions to discuss with your child after the story plus many scriptures from the bible to read with them. I can't wait until my daughter is older so her and I can enjoy this book together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Resource!","review":"We used this decades ago with our kids and have recently bought a few copies for the grandkids. As a retired teacher and youth pastor, and parent and grandparent of 7, I have no hesitation in saying it's one of the best resources for family devotions I've found. The discussion questions and prayer make it easy for any parent to be a success at family devotions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feed your sheep","review":"My beautiful wife and I have reviewed dozens of children's devotionals and this is far and away the best.

I put the handset against a speaker so the people in the other room can hear what is being said. The sound quality is quite good for a low-tech device. Since it doesn't use a battery or wall power it doesn't fail during long telephone calls. It's so simple to use the set-up team has no trouble with it. Although I'm intrigued by hi-tech sometimes low-tech just works better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid, Reliable Corded Phone","review":"I have had this corded phone for a couple of months now. I have not had any problems with it. It has dropped onto the floor a few times and still works as well as it did when I first bought it. It seems to be solidly built. The sound quality is excellent (much better than on my much pricier cordless phone). It doesn't have caller id, or a speakerphone, or other such amenities. But if what you need is a basic corded phone that is solid, reliable, and has excellent sound quality, my experience is that you won't go wrong with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Basic Phone","review":"If you want a basic, no frills, inexpensive, nicely designed phone, this phone is for you.

I brought this phone to use with my plantronics headset. For some reason my expensive phone when used with the headset was not giving a good quality audio. I always assumed it is an issue with the headset.Finally after some experimentation and trial and error I figured it out that it could be a phone issue. When I started using the headset with this phone, audio was clear both ways.I recommend this to anyone who needs a simple yet inexpensive phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"great cheap phone","review":"Your basic feature-free, corded, land line phone.

That left me with no phone service, Cox platitudes notwithstanding.

It does not appear to support a basic older style telephone headset that does work with other telephones without issues.

All of the other phones in my home are cordless. Since my neighborhood is subject to power outages during incliment weather, all of the cordless phones lose power. Nothing like having an old standard corded phone to come to my rescue. Its also great for conducting business whenever private information, like credit card info, must be given over the phone. There's less chance of interception. This phone has a good quality sound and is well made.

It really looks like Spider-Man swinging over a city. Fans of Spidey are treated to the original song from the old cartoon series on the opening track.Track 2,\\"Hero\\", is wonderful, and really fits the feel of the character.Aerosmith's rendition of the old Spider-Man song is also well worth listening to.The rest of the music ranges from adequate to mediocre. Still, this is a good buy. And it's got some extra enhancements that you can enjoy on your computer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good soundtrack but not what I expected.","review":"There are a few songs that are missing in the soundtrack. Thank god they have the parade song on there. But where's the cool song from the trailer. I'm not looking for E.S. Posthumus - Pompeii but I am looking for the other trailer where no one talked in it. It just sounds like the trailer from The Matrix not The Rollercoaster song but the other one the one with no words. If anyone knows please reply. I want that song.

The other song [is horrible]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Even a hero can't save you from this","review":"The song \\"hero\\" without a doubt is the most generic stuff to hit rock radio since the era of Warrant and Poison. Anyone notice how blatantly it copies Seal's \\"Kissed By A Rose\\"? It doesn't get much lower than that.Sum 41 for some reason decided to donate the most annoying and retarted song ever recorded for this soundtrack. Thanks guys!! (P.S. your 15 minutes were up a year ago, please go away :)The rest of the album ranges from bad to decent, but the first two tracks are the equivelence to everything that is wrong with popular music, so thats why this cd gets the big 1/5 rating in my book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the score?

Most of you will know him from his scores for Tim Burton such as \\"Batman\\", \\"Batman Returns\\", and \\"Edward Scissorhands\\" (those are just 3 examples - he's done over 60 films). As it goes, there's a touch of \\"Batman\\" in this score, but Elfman is obviously trying to move away from old style and motifs. \\"Main Titles\\" and \\"Farewell\\" are beautiful themes and will (hopefully) earn Elfman another Oscar nomination. This album is just a teaser for score fans like me, and there will most probably be a full score release, but until then we must put up with this. Don't listen to anything else on the CD except tracks 17 and 18."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to put back in the case!","review":"Normally when it comes to soundtracks I find my 13 year old likes the rock and I only like the orchestrated music, but this soundtrack is very different.All the music is good and over half of it is fantastic, even though the only group/artist I recognize on the whole thing is Aerosmith.Highly recommended, I'm glad to have it in my collection and not worried about the kids listening to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!!!","review":"If you are looking for a soundtrack of the excellent Elfman music heard during the movie, you will be disappointed.

But after listening to my CD for a few days, I found two songs I liked a hundred times better...Corey Taylor's \\"Bother\\" and Black Lab's \\"Learn to Crawl.\\" God, I LOVE \\"Learn to Crawl\\". I could blast that sucker up for five hours and never tire of it.Sum 41, even though I usually hate that punk [junk], did a good job of making a cute rendition of \\"What It's All About\\".

The only exceptional tracks are the \\"Main Title\\" and \\"Farewell,\\" both of which are by Danny Elfman. These two tracks are what make this movie great. Including stupid rock music into movies to promote them is just stupid. I would rather buy the Original Score for this movie than this garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT","review":"This soundrack rocks--literally.

My favorites are: \\"Hero,\\" \\"Spider-Man theme\\" (60's version), \\"Spider-Man theme\\" (Aerosmith), both Danny Elfman songs, and many more. Do not walk to the music store, crawl or swing to it as fast as you can. With a holographic cover (which is sure to be a collectors item,) it is the best soundrack in the last 5-10 years. What are you waiting for? Go Get It!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tangled Web","review":"As has been brought up to me by a guy I work with, music that is \\"from and inspired by\\" is usually a mixed bag. More often than not, first of all, most of the music on a soundtrack is used to run over the end credits. I have no problem with this; however, unless there is some planning involved, the music tends to be pasted together haphazardly over the end credits. If you are lucky, some of the music may be used during the course of the movie. I would safely say most people bought this CD for the song Hero. Anything else is incidental. I like most of the music on this CD as it seems to relate to elements in the movie through its lyrics even though it appears nowhere in the film. Probably my least favorite is the song by the Strokes. Music like this requires an open mind to enjoy. If you are a purist about the music being in the film, then 90% of the songs will not interest you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the score?

I don't even remember most of these songs in the movie. If I wanted rock, I could pick up a rock album. It is a shame that people can be duped into buying a \\"soundtrack\\" that contains less than half of the soundtrack. THe movie was awesome, and so was the music.

I would like to see a Spiderman soundtrack that appeals to someone with a maturity higher than junior high."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I bought this CD and can't say enough good things about it. I'm not a big Nickelback fan, but Hero was very well done, and Saliva's Jorsey Scott singing along is an added bonus. I thought I read it wrong when I saw Corey Taylor on the back, I said something like \\"Slipknot Corey Taylor?\\" He does an excellent job on Bother. Every song is really good, but I must say that Pete Yorn's song stands out. It's actually better than several songs on his debut. Check this one out.

I was pleasantly surprised to hear the theme to the 60's cartoon as the first track. Hero and Bother are extremely strong songs and they made it even more tempting for me to buy the CD. The two Danny Elfman tracks were a little derivative of his Batman score but different enough to leave me wanting more. (Any chance they'll release a score along with the soundtrack?) The clincher though for me was Aerosmith's cover of the Spider-Man theme. Wow!I haven't seen the movie yet but if it's as much fun as the soundtrack, I know that I won't be disappointed. The soundtrack is edgy without being caustic. It's fun without \\"bubble-gum pop\\"ishness. The word \\"alternative\\" is over-used in music. Instead, I shall say merely that the feel of this music was right for my vision of a Spider-Man movie. Exciting, hip, at times touching and even some geekiness mixed in."},{"rating":"1","title":"what?!?","review":"how can you call this a soundtrack? these songs aren't in the frickin movie people...get a clue these are compilations made to hype new bands by slapping a name on the CD that will get people to buy it, not saying the songs aren't good, but it has nothing to do with the film, if I want the Spider-Man soundtrack, I'll wait for Elfman's score....you know, the one in the film...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was it even neccessary to make more than 6 songs?","review":"If you can get this album for 2.00 its worth it.

For those who have insulted people's maturity levels because other people might like this soundtrack (read another review by obiwan48), that truly shows how intelligent that certain person is. Let's just say it doesn't take a rocket scientist to look at the titles and bands of this soundtrack and figure out it is not the full original score.

I like the original Spider-man theme, the version by Aerosmith, and Hero."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jump on the bandwagon","review":"Performance wise - good, but get out your cookie cutters and let's make a soundtrack blatantly formulaic in substance. Then again, what isn't in today's modern music business? The song \\"Hero\\" is the flag bearing single although, I still think Seal did a better job the first time. \\"Hero\\" has so much in common with \\"Kiss From A Rose\\" from the Batman soundtrack that I couldn't believe my ears...of course, the masses probably won't ever notice, nor care for that matter that they're being tricked!

Liked the soundtrack. By far the best tracks are Pete Yorn, Greenwheel and Black Lab. The originals by Danny Elfman are typical of his darker style.

Frankly, whenever I think of super-hero movies, I think of the music that will make the cartoon I loved to read as a child come to life, i.e. John William's Superman, and Danny Elfman's Batman. True to that, the only songs I enjoyed listening to in this soundtrack were Elfman's. Not to dismiss the talent of the other artists in this album, but listening to Aerosmith singing the original 60's cartoon theme song only added to my disappointment that Elfman was not hired to create a full score for the entire movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pictures, very good sound","review":"I use this monitor for my computer.

It is by far the best children's CD I've heard, and we listen to a lot of music. The songs are upbeat and catchy without being frenetic or shrill. There's plenty of banjo and acoustic guitar. The lyrics are folky and outlandish, my favorite thing about kids' music. But by far, the best part about this CD is that the songs are so singable. They're pitched perfectly for a woman with a lazy-to-average range to sing an octave above, the words are easy to learn, and they're so much fun to sing. We've added four or five new songs to our playtime repertoire within the past 10 days!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh... these are cheap, bare-bones, wimpy straps","review":"I'm seldom willing to write a review for an Amazon purchase, but every once in awhile something is so great--or so awful--that I can't help but take the time. This is one of those times when the product is so awful. These straps are cheaply constructed, have very lightweight webbing, and look like they are likely not to last all that long. If it wasn't such a hassle to return things, I would definitely do so. In short, I highly, highly recommend that you look elsewhere.

Attacking the Spanish with his beautiful lover and buccaneer allies, Ned shows his skills as a commander against a background of tropical nature, sailing, treacherous politics and dangerous but declining Spanish Empire.The characters are fairly likable, but there are no interesting villains, and few true challenges, which make the successes in the story less than exciting. The overall lack of suspense, and lack of a motivating cause on the part of the heroes (other than love of excitement and need for money) prevents this book from rising above a mild entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid choice, great value!","review":"After having used the tripod in a couple of photography sessions, I can attest that this tripod has what it takes to shoot in a stable manner.

The 128RC head is pretty good for the occasional video and allows for very smooth fluid panning. If you buy this tripod, don't forget to buy a strap for it or a bag to carry it around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Letters sent after Karen Blixen returned from Africa","review":"This amazing, huge volume contains a large number of letters sent from Karen Blixen to friends and family, as well as letters sent from friends and family to her after her return to Denmark from Africa to a life that she tried to make the best of. It touches on many subjects, i.e. her situation during the II World War; her platonic, yet disturbing relationship with a young married Danish author, her grave illness, her trip to the US, her nominations for Nobel, her family and staff, and much more.The book gives us a fantastic view into her life and a better understanding of who she was and how she came to write some of the best literature ever seen. I highly recommend it to anyone who loved the first set of letters written while she lived in Africa as well as people who have taken an interest in her works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is This An AC/DC Tribute Or Johnny Guitar Watson CD?","review":"I've got nothing against the art of Johnny \\"Guitar\\" Watson.

It's important to experiment with speaker and transmitter positions to find spots where there are no bursts of static (drop-outs). Once I found a good place for the speakers (as close to the transmitter as possible), I heard music with no static.The speakers sound pleasant - mellow in the treble, full but not tubby in the bass. To reduce excess bass, simply place the speakers on chairs or shelves away from the floor and room corners.When you plug the transmitter into a sound card's line output, you must unplug any powered computer speakers from that same output. I got a Y- cord at Radio Shack so that my sound card could drive both the transmitter and my computer's speakers.

Unless your receiver/amplifier has LINE outputs specifically for the REAR SURROUND signal, these will NOT function as rear surround speakers, in direct contradiction to the technical description on Amazon. Just got off the phone with Tech Support who immediately acknowledged my conclusion. You can hook them up to a TAPE OUT, or even a headphone jack, but you wont be getting surround sound...just more of the regular Left and Right signals.

It is very nice to be able to put a speaker anywhere in your house and listen to music. However, despite following all the manufacturer instructions, I could not position or tune the speakers to get noise free reception. There would periodically be a quick hiss or whoosh similar to bad FM reception. I was surprised that the transmission mode between the base and speakers is analog and not digital, which would have provided a noise free sound output. These speakers would probably work fine as part of a surround sound setup where the speakers are in the same room as the base. Anyway, I returned them to the store I purchased them from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste Of Money!","review":"I recently purchased a pair of these speakers and I am VERY disappointed with them. First of all, the range is supposed to be up to 350ft. I had the speakers placed approx. 100 feet from transmitter and every few minutes the sound would crackle, break up, then stop. After several minutes the speakers would turn off. I was told this is what happens when the transmitter loses contact with the speakers. Second of all, the sound quality is VERY poor. I believe a clock radio from 1984 would probably sound better. I plan on returning these speakers immediately for a refund. It is definitely worth the extra effort just to run speakers wires, spend half the money I paid for these, and have better sound. Acoustic Research should be embarrassed for even selling these!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Home Music System","review":"The AW-871 allows me to use our home computer as the base for our music system. The broadcast antenna can be located anywhere near the computer. The speakers can be located anywhere in the house. If only one speaker is to be used in a room, it can be switched from Sterio L or R to Mono. The sound quality is very good. However, at a distance, the single push button tuning on the speakers may combine audio from another source with your audio. The further the speakers are from the source the more patience is needed to lock in on your audio. A tuning dial would have been more practical."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of junk","review":"I bought a pair of these brand new 1 year ago. They worked fine at first, but as time went by, one developed a static-like buzzing in the bass and I eventually had to stop using it because it ruined the sound.

I'm stunned that in this day and age a product can be so poorly made that they go bad in less than a year.

I have a really expensive 5.1 Marantz receiver, but I've never connected rears because having the wires run the length of my living room was always a hassle...trying to mold the wires along the wall or under the carpet was such a pain. So I held off for the last 4 years, relying on the center and left and right speakers for my main source of sound. I thought of using wireless speakers for rears but was skeptical because of all the interference and sound quality problems. But I thought todays (2006) technology would circumvent all those interference and sound issues. After some research I settled on these AR AW-871's. And man they are awesome!!! Easy set up, no hassle and the sound they produce thoroughly compliment my mains and center which are really expensive BOSE speakers! I was really surprised and thank you Acoustic Research!!! I I finally have surround sound!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good, as surround speakers","review":"I bought these solely to serve as the rear channel in a home theater system, where running wires was impossible. The speakers are decent for that use; I didn't try them for anything else. The speakers are about 10' from the transmitter, sited with the home theater's Sony amplifier. I have had no problems at all with their being able to receive signals, or from popping or other problems mentioned by other posters...probably because they are so close to the transmitter, and there are no obstructions to the line-of-sight transmission. Overall, I'm pretty happy so far. They take 8 C size batteries each. I bought 16 alkalines for my first batch. If they go through those pretty quick (I only turn them on for movies), I will buy nicad rechargeables (around $60), since the speakers' power adapters will charge them inside the speaker without having to remove them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good with Batteries","review":"We bought the AW871 speakers and did not see the warning that you cannot have the speaker pluggged in WITH batteries. The batteries expoded and leaked all over. The speaker is ruined. I, along with other customers, did not see this small warning in the instructions. We were using our speakers inside the house (plugged in) and then wanted to use them for outside use (with batteries). Who wants to take time to use a screwdriver everytime we bring them back into the house? Frustrating! Although the product does work fine if using with an outlet. But one of the reasons we did buy the product was for the battery use."},{"rating":"1","title":"They sound like an amped-up transistor radio","review":"I got these to play music in my back yard; they couldn't even fill up my kitchen with anything but a hollow, tinny sound.

They are tempermental to position to other electronic systems. And, the feedback displays on the wireless transmitter does not make it any easier. Basically, the instructions say if the light is blinking, but not more than half the time, it is okay. If they light does not go on or it blinks too much, then you get no sound.

Upon reading the instruction manual, you will see on pages 3 and 4 that you are to plug these into your RCA jacks or headphone jack of your receiver. This will give you stereo but not the signal for the rear channel of surround sound.On the top of Page 4 it clearly states,\\"Warning: this product is designed to work with line level outputs or headphone outputs ONLY. DO NOT connect it directly to speaker outputs, as it will permanently damage the tranmitter.\\"After calling the toll free line at Acoustic Research, and explaining my situation to their technical advisor, it was comfirmed that these speakers are not to be plugged into the speaker outputs out the amplifier. This would destroy the transmitter. I am sure these would sound great if you only needed stereo, however it is wrong to say these can be used as rear channels."},{"rating":"1","title":"For what its worth","review":"My buddy, who used to manage a Cambridge Soundworks, would call this a boomerang product since it and others like it were so often purchased then returned. However, I think it is worth the price I paid. I was concerned that it operates at 900 megahertz...same as my cordless phone but, so far, no problems there. Just be careful that there is a fairly direct line of sight from transmitter to speakers as the signal does not do corners or walls all that well.

The one speaker that did work had to constantly be fine tuned to negate hissing, popping and static. I live in a metropolitan condo which may have contributed. The 300 feet range might be achieved if you live in a house with no walls, no electrical fields in the middle of nowhere; of course no electrical fields would probably mean no electric, which means that you'd really be out of luck.

They have a well balanced tone, automatically shut off (5 min delay) when the transmitter is shut off, automatically lock on to the transmitter after pushing the volume button, and are moderately loud. However, you trade off volume for high frequency range. The higher the input level to the transmitter, the less high frequency tones that get transmitted, and the lower the hiss from the receiver. I have chosen a lower drive to the transmitter, which gives a good high frequency response, but limited volume, and some noticeable hiss in a quiet room. The transmitter goes about 100 feet (through four walls).

Also, probably the biggest failure in my opinion is that they appear to be line of sight - that is, they fade in and out when you walk around the room.

He was a man who loved life--wine, women and philosophy, but after the death of his father he retired and began these meditations on life, seeking solace in the great record of human experience found in the classics. Montaigne wrote during the bloody religious wars of the Counter-Reformation--one of his essays describes his near death at the hands of Protestant marauders. The combination of the highly civilised culture of the France of his day and the seething and pitiless violence that was also a fact of life was also a subject that drove him back to the classics. These profound meditations, eternally relevant, will assist anyone who continues to reflect on the wonder and the pity of human existence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Asi asi!","review":"I love Marc Anthony's vocal range and passion, and I've been waiting to hear the follow-up to his outstanding English-language debut CD. \\"Mended\\" doesn't come anywhere close to what he delivered the first time.

The album may sound impressive (from a production standpoint), but in terms of being truly interesting... not a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album for the summer","review":"I love this album because Marc integrates pop and latin beats together in almost every track. My favorite tracks off the album would have to be \\"Tragedy\\" and \\"I've got you\\" because they both display Marc's powerful voice. I also love \\"I Reach For You\\". It sounds cool because it's a ballad with latin rhythms in it. Some of the lyrics could've used more work, but I find it very enjoyable to listen to, especially in the car driving to work. Great job Marc! I look forward to seeing you in concert."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Utter Bore","review":"It's amazing how slick, soulless production and lazy songwriting can sidetrack even the best vocalist. Unfortunately, this is the predicament that Marc Anthony finds himself in with his second English-language effort MENDED, which frankly is no better or worse than his uninspired debut. In the process,the lackluster production and songwriting has managed to quell whatever passion is usually found in his music. He's managed to surround himself yet again with a batch of boring, cookie-cutter AC babble('I've Got You' is the best you're going to get here,I'm afraid)--it seems as though he's threatening to become the next Michael Bolton. And I think we all know what happened there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have For the Summer.","review":"There is no doubt that Marc Anthony has one of the best voices in pop music today, and his second english language album proves it once again. There is nothing new on his second effort, its basically an exact replica of his debut, but why mess with a good thing. Where Marc Anthony shines is his ability to deliver a gorgeous ballad with a lot of power and emotion. Songs like I Need You, Mended, and Everything You Do are stunning. His voice sounding better than ever. Of course there are the latin flavored dance tracks like Tradgedy, I Swear, and the first single I've Got You. Songs that need to be played at full volume. They are funky and exciting. Marc Anthony fans won't be disappointed, and hopefully new fans will embrace him and learn to appreciate his superior voice.

Clearly mended was made in a period he was in love of his ex-husband, so if you are in love, you will enjoy a lot this album, especially songs like She Mends Me, I Need You and I've Got You. Even there are a new version of the song Tragedy (I like this version, but I prefer the radio version). In general, the album is good, and if you are a Marc fan, you will enjoy the power of his voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mended - not to be missed","review":"I am a great fan of Marc Anthony and this is his second english album that I have bought.

My tastes are genre~less so i had no preconcieved requirements but it was just too boring to pay attention to.. i couldn't even make it thru each song without skipping thru to the ends. It's not even good enough to let play in the background during a mindless task. I truly disliked it. I think he's got a great voice and he takes a pretty picture, but the bland sameness of every song was mentally too much to take for me. It was torture. I'm sure he'll do much better next time.

THE BOOK MADE ME AWARE OF THE K9 SITUATION SINCE I NEVER HEARD OF THIS BEFORE. IT WOULD BE NICE IF A PORTION OF THE BOOK WENT TO BUYING VESTS FOR THE K9 BOOKS. GREAT WRITING KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK FERN MICHAELS"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plain Jane","review":"Don't waste a perfectly good summer day reading this one. It's \\"for the dogs\\", literally. Between the huggy/kissy dog stuff, and the haunted houses and ghosts, this book insults the intelligence of anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dogs and ugly duckling","review":"It will help if you REALLY like dogs before you start reading this book - likeThe Searchby Nora Roberts. Because dogs are a very big and a great part of \\"Plain Jane.\\"I liked the down-to-earth personality of Jane. I especially loved her godparents, Fred and Trixie (I want them to adopt me). I love dogs so the many dog scenes were a plus for me.I thought Michael, the love interest, could have been developed a lot more (Jane deserved better). And some of the scenes weren't too believable. But I read fiction for the simple reason that it is fiction. And I enjoyed this story."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth finishing","review":"How did this book get classified as a romance novel? This book had no sizzle at all. The writing and characters were flat and uninspiring. I couldn't finish the book, only got about one quarter of the way through and had to quit I was so bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"This book was not at all up to the standards of previous books by this author which I have enjoyed. The writing style was totally different.I was uncertain about whether I was to treat this very serious plot as a joke due to the inclusion of every trite phrase or cliche I have ever heard in what I presume was supposed to be a breezy style of writing. Where could the editor have been?This read as if it were by a totally different author from previous books by Fern Micheals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring ! ! !","review":"What was this book about? Where was the romance? This is the first book by Ferns Michaels I have ever read and definitely the last. Is like a collection of unfinished thoughts. The characters are vastly undeveloped and the plot is lost under piles of unrelated events haphazardly throw together. What I keep wandering is, how exactly did this book make it to the Best Seller list?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried, but..........","review":"I just could not get into this book. I did not find any of these characters interesting. The plot is boring (if you can call it a plot) and just plain stupid. Don't bother!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I must be missing something...","review":"This was my first Fern Michaels book. I really wanted to like this book, the back cover sounded so promising and the clincher for me was that the book was a NY Times bestseller. How could I go wrong? While I like Miss Michaels' writing style, I didn't bond with any of the characters. Some of the subplots seemed too far-fetched and almost silly. (The dog barking on cue after the main character makes a statement or asks a question was particularly tiresome and a little too Disney-like for me.) I had a very hard time making it through the book but finished it anyway. Since Fern Michaels seems to have a legion of fans out there, I must be missing whatever it is that everyone can't seem to get enough of in her books. If you are one of these diehards, you'll probably enjoy the book, however for the first-time Fern Michaels reader, I'd advise you to skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plain Jane","review":"I really enjoyed Plain Jane ...It has a great love story as well as a mystery ...as always Fern has great characters & several wondeful dogs in this book ....I love the animals !! They make the story . I also like the ghost in the book !!! When I fifnsh reading any of Fern's books , I feel like I have learned a lesson in life ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"This book had a lot of potential, but boy was I disappointed. First of all Ms. Michael's writing style was not for me. It seemed to be all conversation, the whole book was in quotation marks practically. There was little narrative by the author. Therefore, you had little insight into what the characters were thinking. This makes for very one dimensional characters and I didn't enjoy the act of actually reading the book--it was awkward. Also, it seemed very hokey to me. As another reviewer has said, you can tell the author is older. The writing was not very current, a little cutesy for my taste. On the positive side, however, I did enjoy the characters of the godparents, Trixie and Fred. They were much more interesting than Jane. Also, I found it commendable that Ms. Michaels wanted to spotlight the hard-working K-9 police dogs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good......","review":"First of all do you know any man who would use the phrase \\"flopsy-doodle\\" to describe a hat? My husband would have to relinquish his manhood if he ever said that. My biggest problem with this book is the dialog was not realistic. You could tell the author was probably older and all of her characters sounded like someones Great Aunt Penny, even the men. The plot seemed to meander quite a bit too. One hundred pages into the book I was still wondering what it was about. This book was so smarmy I couldn't even bring myself to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry I wasted my time","review":"Story starts out interesting and then goes downhill from there when ghosts start appearing and her elderly god parents decide to train K-9 dogs. The shrink sessions are pretty good though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ditto","review":"Well folks, I have to agree with most of you. This book was unbelievable. As a mystery, it left you wondering. As a romance it was seriously lacking. As a ghost story, it was benign. No redeemable qualities at all. How can someone's best efforts miss the mark so far?That's about all I have to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely read","review":"As always Fern Michaels was a delight to read. It just feels good to read her stories. This one had some beautiful sentiments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plain Jane","review":"Very good book. I would recommend it to my friends and family.

I purchased this book on my kindle at Amazon.com."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not bother to finish","review":"I read anything and everything, but this was so horrible I couldn't finish it. Characters must be believable even in fiction. Not even the dogs could save this book for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plain Jane","review":"As always Ms Michaels has written a good story. I recommend it to anyone who likes an easy way to relax and enjoy some pleasurable hours.purchased from Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started off with a bang!","review":"A first time reader of this author, I was highly pleased with the interesting, well-written opening, however, things went rapidly down-hill. Jane was a total contridiction. Either she is ugly and mousy, or confident and beautiful. The ghost scenes were great, but the the interaction between Jane and her mom left a lot to be desired. There should have been more suspense, I kept expecting the rapists to go after Jane, but that storyline just faded away. I am all for happy endings, but appreciate the characters working harder to achieve it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"That's what friends are for","review":"Poor Jane was the chubby nerd of LSU when on one night she comes to the aid of a woman that is her total opposite. Jane hides the secrets of that violent evening for twelve years when she finally realizes that she has to overcome her fears and her ghosts. Plain Jane really gives a reader a beautiful tour or rural Louisana and of course Ms. Michaels always has an array of colorful character and their even more colorful dogs. The one thing I love about Fern Micheals stories is that the main character's dog are the \\"rock of Gilbraltar\\" in their lives. They characters conversations with them as if they were humans themselves. I would love to see one of Fern Micheal's stories on the small or silver screen because the characters are life-like and readers can really related. And I'm sure there is a Jane Daniels walking on every college campus right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth my time","review":"Really enjoyed the way this ever present topic of self worth was treated. An easy to read style although plenty of emotion in it to keep you reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of her good ones...","review":"I normally enjoy a Fern Michaels story, but this I did not care for at all. Not just because the horrific events at the beginning of the book, but the additional cramming of just about every romance novel story thread into it as well. To wit: the aforementioned Revenge/Recovery from a Tragedy/Crime; the Handsome Co-Worker Who May Be a Love Interest; the Crazy/Eccentric Relatives Who Mean Well; the Animals Who Seem to Know More About What's Going On Than the Humans; and finally, the Heroine Communicates With a Ghost Who Needs Help... I think there are one or two more in there as well. It's like there was some sort of deadline where she had to turn in one of each type of story, and ended up shoving them all into one book. Any one of these themes, perhaps two, should have been more than sufficient, but all together they were very distracting. There are much better Fern Michaels stories out there, much better than this one..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the Characters \\"Trixy & Fred!!","review":"Fern Michaels is such a superb writer. The characters are very well written, which draws the reader in, and you can't help but become immediately emotionally involved with them and the story.Jane had Some issues in her personal Life She needed to Come to terms with But once she did things turned out GREAT for her! I ENJOYED this book Alot!Two Thumbs up Ms Michaels!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plain Jane is Plain Bad!","review":"I have to agree with most of you. This book is one of the all times worst written book. The story and characters are all lacking. From the beginning pages it was painful to read. The plot lines are so ridiculous that nothing is developed - not as a romance, not as a suspense and not as a ghost story. Jane is supposed to an intelligent woman who overcomes much but I am not seeing anything to recommend. Jane as the h has little redeeming character traits. This book insults the intelligence and is a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK Read","review":"I actually ended up liking this book more than I thought I would. I really enjoyed the dog interaction. I must say, though, the book definitely fell short in at least one area...Jane finally found the guys resonsible for the crime, which the majority of the book leads up to, but then their punishment wasn't discussed in detail. Overall,I enjoyed the book, and would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable read...","review":"I would recommend this book to family and friends. By the end of the second chapter I was hooked and really wanted to find out 'who did it'. I believe in spirits (not spooks! lol) and I'm a animal lover.If for some reason you don't like animals and are not interested in the spirit world, then the book wouldn't hold your interest. Though I just can't understand why someone wouldn't love animals! They would have to have a steel heart, right?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read...","review":"This book touched on all of my emotions. It takes alot for me to get interested in a book and this book had me on the first page.I wanted the book to go on forever. I would reccomend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The House on 92nd Street","review":"This is an excellent movie of it's time & style.Most assuredly it is a bald face propaganda film but in the context of what was acceptable in the 1940's & 1950's, when I grew up it, is very entertaining.Today with what we know about J. Edgar Hoover it is even more interesting. What propaganda! Just look at all those people in Washington DC FBI HQ who today are all replaced by computers. Check out the 1945 version of NCIS and CSI forensic investigation.Signe Hasso is stunning though quite evil in this film. I would like to see something else she may have done in english language films.Great shots of NYC when there were few, if any, towers on the upper east side. Just imagine what the rent would be on The House on 92nd St. at todays rates.I thoughly enjoyed the move."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine WWII suspense/espionage/thriller","review":"The treacherous villainous woman in this thriller is really excellent around which the film twists. She will surprise you guaranteed and for the gents, she's quite a looker too.Great supporting cast, high suspense espionage and just what your looking for. Based on documentary intelligence records and really excellent first of the realism photoed movies shot on actual locations. First of the post WWII noir-based genres. Good curling-up entertainment with Lloyd Nolan also who is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated Wartime Artifact","review":"This film won on Oscar for best screenplay in 1945. This is probably more of a reflection of the attitudes expressed in the script than any artistry contained within. I can see where the film would strike a chord with wartime audiences with it's portrait of Nazi agents operating freely within our borders. Today, however, the film is just incredibly dated in it's depiction of an omnipotent FBI and cartoonish Nazis. I would rate this film higher but it moves at such a snails pace that it borders on the sleep-inducing. William Eythe as Dietrich, the American double-agent, has to be one of the most wooden actors ever to star in a major motion picture. He was definitely competing with the coat rack in the magnetism department. If you must see this film see it as a wartime propaganda relic. And remember, you can purchase your war bonds at the theatre."},{"rating":"2","title":"spy movie","review":"This was an enjoyable recounting of an actual spying event. I enjoyed the mixture of documentary footage. The ending was interesting. It was amusing to see how old time equipment was used in protecting the US."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cat's Game","review":"My seven yr. old got this as a present. The game itself is attractive and well constructed. However, it drastically lacks any strategic challenge. The game says for ages 5 and up. But, my seven yr. old was way too old for it. At least with tic-tac-toe there was some challenge until every game became a \\"cat's game.\\" With Topitop EVERY game was a \\"cat's game\\". It would be more appropriately used for teaching a two yr. old to stack, but,the game pieces would be a choking hazard. It baffles me to read that this game has won awards. You are better off leaving this one on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"The big named songs here are all remakes, pretty good remakes at that.

Today, when the Holy Scriptures are under an unrelenting attack, these essays are truly a breath of fresh air.From tracing the history of Higher Criticism, to Christ verifying the OT, to the ONE author of Isaiah, the authenticity of the Book of Daniel and much, much more, I not only highly recommend this two volume set, but you do yourself a great injustice if you don't have these essays.These essays are devastating to the arguments of all these unbelieving \\"scholars\\" that have, over the years, tried to make the Scriptures out to be nothing but myth and fairy tales.Just one essay out of the entire set, is more than worth the price of the complete set.Please, read these essays.

I expected the type to be small. That would not be a problem if the type were at least darker. I don't understand why they could not make the type as dark as the subject headings. At least that would have made it more readable. The red type is even worse. It is so faded that it is almost impossible to read. I am returning this bible and will have to look elsewhere for a small study bible. BUYER BEWARE: Because I opened the book to look at it, Amazon charged me 50% on my refund for \\"obvious signs of use\\".

The phone simply stands up on your desk, and you talk to it. The sound is excellent.The only complaint I have is with the answering machine. If the caller doesn't speak fairly loudly, you won't be able to understand them very well. Still, it seems good enough.The shape of the handset might feel funny at first but now I really like it.

After four months of using it we are again searching for a good phone, but this time we won't buy anything we haven't tried out first. One of the big features are that you CAN download any song of your choosing as a ring tone, but only 7 seconds of it, and then you can barely hear it when the phone rings. It saves hang ups as messages. It is often difficult to understand what someone is saying on messages. When you hear a message then push delete you often end up deleting the next message which you haven't even heard yet. When you get a call waiting call the screen doesn't light up so you can't tell who is calling in. It's nearly impossible to hold the handset between your ear and your shoulder when you're trying to write something down. And, the list goes on and on. We truly haven't really found ANY redeeming qualities to this phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"This phone is horrible!","review":"The first several months with this phone was okay, and I liked that you could buy additional handsets. But after a few months, things went downhill. There would be random times when the caller would be unable to hear me, even though I could hear them just fine. I had my phone line checked, and it was fine. Then we even switched to a cable phone line, and it still happens, so I know it's the phone itself and not the service provider. Now I have buttons that aren't working. So between the non-functioning buttons and calls that blank-out, I think it's very much time to start phone shopping.

I had to come back here to say that this is one of the worst internet purchases I have ever made. The songs were slow & overly simplistic, as well as dated. I listened to this with my husband and our 5 year old daughter. There was one song on here that our daughter liked, the rest about bored us all to tears.

He related several job-related incidents of working in the coroner's office of New York City, and then switched to the upheaval of 9/11. At this point, he seemed to be a one man savior for the identification process, and never missed a chance to question his superiors, or note the time he personally spent. With the exception of mentioning a very few co-workers, which he recruited, he barely mentions the huge staff effort to accomplish the identification of 9/11 victims."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted to hear more","review":"Very disappointing read.

It was somewhat informative, and the descriptions of the work itself were moderately interesting. However, the author spent so much time regaling the readers in his expertise, his compassion and his many talents that it became almost a farce. Over and over again, we were subjected to the details of his magnificence. I was very disappointed as, given the subject matter, this had the ability to be an outstanding book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-serving, go-nowhere book","review":"I thought this book would be about how the NY Medical Examiner's office reacted to the events of 9/11. But it isn't. It is about the author's journey to becoming a medical examiner, written in the first person, and it is poorly written, pendantic and over-arching. The first chapter(s) are spent letting us know of his personal career journey, which as far as I can tell consists of him trying to make a doctor's salary without being a doctor. The rest of the chapters then tell us about how we, the general public, could never do his job because death is something we really can't deal with. Only one chapter chronicles 9/11. Sorely disappointing book clearly written to captialize on 9/11."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading... This book is about the author and his ego...","review":"One of most boring books I have ever read. The book's cover leads one to believe that it's about all the behind the scenes stuff at a Medical Examiner office, matter of fact, it says exactly that. Unfortunately, this is about the life of the author, his rise to be a coroner's \\"investigator\\", with very little in between about the real goings on in the medical examiner's office. There's a lot of paperwork shuffling in his office, but not much about the real down and dirty stuff.If I were you, I'd pass on this one.

There are a number of interesting details and glimpses of the author's personal life and the toll his job takes on it.There is some discussion of forensics as it relates to the medical examiner's office. My chief complaint is that these are superficial. The author rarely seems to touch on the complexity of some forensic determinations and the controversies over some of the accepted wisdom in this area. Thus, it is a good guide to procedure, but those interested in forensic details may wish a more specialized book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Healthy pill","review":"Not the best flavor but it is awesome off immune system and digestion among other things.

Everyone is either too noble or too villainous. The plot requires characters to behave like idiots. If they didn't, the novel would much, much shorter. Because the characters are one dimensional, it's impossible to feel anything for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"What am I missing??","review":"I have just read this book for our Book Club and found it a struggle to get through. I slogged through it until about half way then skipped to the end just so I would know what happened and be able to discuss it a little at our meeting. I found the writing style pedantic and the plot to be unrelentingly dismal and bleak. And, no, I don't need to read about happy people and happy things--I just want some characters I can believe in and root for! Richards' symbolism was so obvious--come on: the villians' names were, and I'm not kidding, McVicer, Devlin and Pit. Give me a break! I definitely don't understand why this book continues to get 4 and 5 stars from readers. What on earth am I missing here?? For brilliant writing style and insight into the human condition go find a Michael Ondaaje book."},{"rating":"2","title":"held my interest","review":"Not a perfect novel IMO. I felt for the first 2/3 especially as tho it was set in the 30s, rather than relatively modern times.There were some smallish things that bothered me like 9000 people gathered in the town hall of a community that sounded from the way the story was written, as tho it might have been a community of about 200 people at most. And it was more than a bit repetitious on some details.But, the book was very big on \\"I wonder what will happen next?\\" so I didn't get bored and quit it.If you enjoy books about situations that seem for most part hopeless and bleak, (as I do) you'll like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Misfortunes of biblical proportions","review":"If I was rating this book on the writing alone, it would certainly be worth five stars. However as the other reviewers have stated this book is ripe with painful almost unbearable material, and the sheer difficulty of slogging through the misfortunes of the Henderson family makes for some mighty depressing reading. You will likely find yourself saying \\"Enough already, how much more can these poor people take!\\" That said this is still an excellent book, and well worth your time to read. Just remember if you are looking for a \\"feelgood\\" read this is probably not the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"My New Favorite","review":"I got this book for Christmas, and after reading the first few pages, which were pretty dull, I was ready to put it down. But I kept reading, and am I ever glad I did! The story is about a poor family in the Maritimes, and is told by the oldest son, Lyle. His family, especially his brilliant and gentle father, is subjected to extreme injustices almost unrelentingly, as others see Sydney as an easy target. Despite it all, Sydney insists on helping the very people who hurt him. Lyle becomes a very bitter and angry young man, and his solution to life's problems is to fight back, something his father refused to do. This story is outrageous and depressing, and the ending is bittersweet at best. Not the kind of book you'd expect to steal your heart, but the overriding grace and goodness of Sydney Henderson did just that. Richards is an extremely talented writer whose characters seemed almost more real than real people. I'd definitely recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I was disappointed in this book. I fail to understand how it could have been given the Giller prize. The characters are flat and the main character (or author) spends most of the book whining about the misfortunes that have befallen his family. I thought when I started the book that the characters would learn something. Unfortunately they didn't. We are left with a sense of dissatisfaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"For masochists only","review":"The thing is, Richards is a superb writer. His sentences flow, his images are wonderful. There is not a false step in his choice of words. BUT: it doesn't work, for me at least. I found the story absolutely stupifying, boring, and depressing - I did not want to find out what happened to his miserable characters, nor was I pulled in to the mysteries of Nowhere, New Brunswick. It confirmed, however, all the prejudices I had about the bleakness of that part of the country. I found it similar to watching those sleepy Canadian movies from the 70s, experimental and bravely non-Hollywood, but finally unwatchable - you could tell within 10 seconds that you were watching a Canadian movie just by the texture of the film, and the same thing happens with Richards. Why must all Canadian prize-winning novels be set in small towns? Let this be a lesson to all aspiring writers: you can be a master with words, but that doesn't mean you can write a story."},{"rating":"1","title":"¿Why they call them \\"phase coated\\" if its prism is not phase coated?","review":"Phase coated prisms are very expensive.

BEWARE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very believeable... it's sacry!","review":"It seems to me that many fictional computer books are written as if the computers were actually alive... the exact thing the main character in Host, Joe Messenger, is trying to achieve. The subject Peter James writes about is very thought provoking in an age where medical medical sciences are advancing quickly, and maybe this book isn't as outragous as one would typically be inclined to think. The elements of this novel do exist, and computer scientists in the field on AI are advancing... maybe someday this will happen... but chances are not in my lifetime. Off of the subject matter of this book- the way Peter James creates his characters is remarkable. Throughout the story I felt I had connected in some way with these characters through nothing more than Peter James' writing style. I'm going to look into more books by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb series of performances.

The book explains things in a non-judgmental way. It's clear and practical.

It's one of those die-hard breastfeeding books but, there's not much to help if you do have difficulties."},{"rating":"1","title":"Discouraging","review":"I found the book to be very vague and condescending. I felt the underlying message of the book was that if you do not succeed at breastfeeding, you have failed your child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough detail , not worth the money","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. I had already made the decision to breast feed before buying this book, so I was bored reading the lengthy text about why I should breastfeed.Breastfeeding is tricky and frustrating in the beginning. You will have a lot of questions about what you can, can't eat, how often you need to breastfeed, what signs you should look for to determine if your baby has an allergy to food, and how to start weaning if you are going back to work. The book doesn't provide enough detail to answer these questions. Also the organization of the book didn't make sense to me and the index is not helpful.I found the website kellymom.com much more helpful in terms of providing breastfeeding tips and answers to breastfeeding questions."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best breastfeeding resource available","review":"I purchased this book randomly and feel that I hit the jackpot on the first try! This is perhaps the best and most informative book on breastfeeding available (I've read others and although many were good they all seemed to fall short in comparison) and it did much to boost my confidence both before my baby was born and in the challenging early weeks of nursing. The information found within the book is stated in a very clear, positive, orderly, consise, practical, and descriptive manner and the format makes it very easy to flip back and forth to clarify points and to answer questions. I assure you that you will refer to this book over and over again and it help you to be a success as a nursing team."},{"rating":"2","title":"review","review":"I am a nurse and I bought this book hoping it would tell me something I didnt already know, kind of like a last ditch effort for me. It was helpful, and I believe someone who didnt have the opportunity to follow a lactation consultant around during clinicals would find it very beneficial. I have since quit putting her to breast but continue to pump. She just doesnt like to latch or suck right, she kind of flutters her tongue gets ticked off when nothing comes out then starts to chomp. But I would buy this book again and would recommend it to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, a must have!","review":"I received this book as a gift from a friend. It has been so helpful since I had my baby. I highly recommend this to anyone even considering breastfeeding. I still find myself referring to the book occasionally. Buy this book before you have your baby and start reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for pregnant mothers!","review":"This comprehensive book covers all areas of breastfeeding. It includes pros and cons of nursing for both mother and baby. Mothers uncertain about whether or not they will nurse will learn the important benefits and get practical advice. Those who are certain they want to nurse can use this book as a guide from pregnancy to weaning. It is a quick read but contains important information on an important decision."},{"rating":"1","title":"too vague","review":"No matter what problem I was having, when I looked it up in this book, I still wasn't sure what was going on. For instance, when trying to wean my baby, I was experiencing soreness and pain. I would think that is a common problem that needs addressing, but there is only a vague mention in here. Or, when I was wondering what effect my diet had on the baby, or if I was sick, how would that affect him? I feel these are basic things that all women would want to know. If you compare this book to \\"What to Expect When You're Expecting\\" and it's sequel, \\"What to Expect the 1st Year\\" it pales by comparison. I never had to refer to any other source while those were around. If you want a handy resource while you're breastfeeding, keep looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Profound Influence on My Relationship with God!","review":"Perhaps it is because Watchman Nee has not been compromised by the cluter of today or the prevalence of sin in the US, for his simple insiights into the Word have changed my life.If there is a book through truly addresses the difference between \\"religion\\" and \\"relationship\\" and what God has done for each of us personally, this is the one. I thought Yancey or Chambers were great and they are, but perhaps it's his cultural perspective that add's a freshness I have not known.Chap 4. Based on Galatians 2:20 was especially meaningful.

It is excellent!","review":"As I read the beginning of A Hero of Our Time, I became bored with his descriptions of modern settings, and a man on a journey. However, I was fortunate enough to have the good sense of reading further. The characters bacame more scandulous, and the plots thickened to an eventual overtaking of themselves. This book brought insight into my life, and hope that I was not the only person that has dreaded the society and some people in it. Lermontov's genius is displayed perfectly as each character unfolds. His depictions of these people were more realistic than any other novel that I have ever read. Please read this novel and seek further into the plot. Instead, look into the characters, and the truth behind their actions, as they display human behavior."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ah, the Superfluous Man","review":"For those of you who are interested in 19th Century Russian Literature, and are even more so interested in the notion of the \\"superfluous man\\", look no further. Having read this years ago in college, I guess I didnt grasp Lermontov's mastery of imagery. Pechorin, the main character of this series of novellas, is on the one hand quite a complex character, but yet on the other hand, a prototype of the superfluous man. I have been told that Pechorin's character is on par with that of Pushkin's Evgeny Onegin, but I haven't read that yet, so I will withhold comment. However, the humor and drama in this short book will certainly reward the reader. 5 Stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A literary landmark","review":"This book is ignored much more than it should be in America. Pechorin is a must know literary character in my opinion. This book is an unbelieveable work of Russian literature at its best. Everyone should read this book just for the amazing psychological character of Pechorin."},{"rating":"2","title":"A haunting, lyrical novel","review":"This novel describes the life and times of Pechorin, a rogue-ish officer of the Russian army, through his journals and interactions with narrator. He is a confusing character, sometimes dauntingly aloof, at other times compassionate to a fault. In all cases, he is utterly fascinating as a truly amoral character who is both haunted and invigorated by an innate need for adventure.One of the interesting aspects of this novel is its unusual structure, which skips back and forth in time and which gives us several different perspectives of Pechorin.Another bonus is the fact that it is completely accessible to any reader, whether they know anything about Russian literature or history."},{"rating":"1","title":"This print is not a proper book!","review":"This print is not a proper book as one would expect! It is a floppy magazine-format booklet that is apparently printed on-demand from the freely available e-book text. (The date of print in the back is identical to the date of purchase.)

I'm glad I did, because it is a very interesting and entertaining read. I know of few other novels, especially from this period, that manage to cover as much ground both in terms of narrative action and thematic exploration in so few pages. The novel's themes of love, death, and fate clearly set a precedent for later writers like Dostoyevsky and Turgenev, but Lermontov's voice and style are his own. I give it 4 1/2 stars since it is somewhat rough around the edges. I wonder what Lermontov might have written had he not died so young (and in such romantic fashion!). I look forward to reading his poetry, if I can find it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Russian Lit!","review":"I am no professional. I don't even read all that much but, this novel should keep anyone interested. I am a college student and this was one of the novels from my Russian Prose and Drama corse. I think the way Lemontov writes is very forward and clear. I laughed out load at Max in the first chapter (laughing from a book was a first for me). I really liked this one and will read through again. The only bad thing I can state is that all of the characters can be confusing.

The vitamin Shoppe's standard shipping was 99cents. It took a couple of weeks to finally receive my order and it was only the orange flavor. On my receipt from the seller in said that the cherry was on back order and I saw that they doubled my shipping rate to $1.98 when it was supposed to be 99cents. When I emailed them twice about the shipping they ignored me both times and I also cancelled the back ordered item with the seller but still received it in the mail a few weeks later and still no comment from the seller. I know it is only 99cents but it is the principal of it and I don't trust \\"The vitamin shoppe\\". Plus when you cancel a back order item doesn't that mean for the seller to 'cancel it'! I will never order from them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comments on Exit into History: A Journey Through the New Eastern Europe","review":"As a frequent visitor to Eastern (Central) Europe, I found the book full of insights into those countries,with accurate cultural comments.

Hoffman describes her journey through some Eastern European countries in excruciating detail, which made it difficult for me to find any major relevant themes. It's basically a travel journal. Hoffman is a good writer - her descriptions use an interesting range of words, and her sentences are pleasantly structured. I would recommend it to people who have a major interest in Poland, or who are like Hoffman herself: immigrants from Eastern Europe to North America. It's not a story type of book, so you have to be interested in the topic beforehand."},{"rating":"1","title":"a glossy no-starter","review":"A glossy book, tourist-type pictures, little practical information, and very limited sicussion of the Galapagos"},{"rating":"2","title":"As advertised","review":"Microcote really does dries your nails fast.

The first thing I noticed on the CD was a switch from mostly male vocals, to mostly female vocals.The songs also seemed to have a different style, at first, it really didn't sound that good to me. It wasn't to catchy, and sounded a bit plain and repetitive.After about two weeks, and a few re-listens to the CD, I found myself in love with it. It grew on me a lot, and now I listen to it all the time. Songs like \\"The Line\\", \\"At the Borders\\", and \\"Leaving This Town\\" Quickly became some of my favorite songs.I don't really know what category this CD would fall into, but, if you like punk, rock, emo, indie...

The bedding itself looks good on the bed as you can see from the picture. It is a little rough to touch, but I believe if it is washed 2-3 times it should soften up pretty nicely. My son absolutely loves it. He doesn't mind the feel of the fabric. It hasn't been an issue with him sleeping on/in it. I gave the item 4 stars because it pleased the child it was purchased for. I believe that is the important factor. If you are looking for something of great quality, this is not it.

And to add insult to injury, the elastic edge on the bottom sheet started to unravel and create a 4 inch hole.I'm no expert on thread count when it comes to sheets, but I would guess that these are around 100.

The writing is skillful, and the text benefits immensely from extensive quotations from Wright's voluminous letters. Wright's voice is lively and witty and she makes very good company for the 7 or 8 hours required to read this book.In the eyes of history, Wright has been overshadowed by her older sister Lucretia Mott and her contemporaries Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony. But her central participation in both the woman's rights and anti-slavery causes secures her a place as one of the giants of the mid-19th century. Wright believed strongly in the benefits of free expression and complete tolerance even of shocking views expressed by others.

I guess the reason I gave it 1 star is that these two clowns wear their rabbit costumes throughout the entire film, even after they are fired from their jobs as Easter Bunnies.

I would have liked some ties that were longer than the orange/white/black ones but a little shorter than the very long black ones. But all in all, this was a very worthwhile purchase, and this is a great deal. The ties are easy to use and are sturdy.

I continued using the other side, until the same happened, and I noticed the sleeve stuck on the probe. After, the sleeve refused to stay in the clip. So, I switched the whole setup to removeable probe tips, so now the clips I use slide on in place of the probes.

I have alot of dangly & hooped earrings. I had to pretty much skip every other row & I put all my large hoops on the bottom, to allow for maximum room. I've put 30 pairs of earrings on it & there is still room for a few more pair but not many.

That all changed when I filled it with tea. It is quite heavy and the handle is on the small side. The lid fits and seals as advertised. The thing I detest most about this pitcher is that while pouring and after you stop pouring, it runs down the outside of the pitcher. The only defense is to hold a paper towel under the pouring lip to catch the leaking fluid.I would not recommend this pitcher."},{"rating":"2","title":"So hard to find!!","review":"I absolutely would purchase this again. I bought two and love them. I was concerned when I unpacked them and it seamed there was a flaw in the handle but turns out that is because the glass was shaped causing what looked like a crack.

Easy to store but the Lid is too loose. Had to hold the lid when pouring liquid"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than plastic","review":"I got this to replace my old plastic pitcher. I am happy I did. The handle is good for my petite hands. The lid seals tight. I have no problem opening it. It is a bit heavy, especially when full. And the pour spout could be more defined. It dribbles a bit down the front when poured. But I like it overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't love it","review":"I'll keep this short. I'm a grown man with grown man hands, and this handle was very tight against the base and short. Very uncomfortable to pour when full. You can't pour with the lid on. Liquid frequently ran down the side of the pitcher when it did pour due to the infinitesimal spout. And mine cracked within two days of putting tea into it to cool down in the fridge. I left the tea out for a good hour after it came to boil, so the liquid was warm but not excessively so. My cheap crappy $1 store pitchers can take it. But not this.I bought this pitcher to look nicer in my fridge for company, but nothing about this pitcher was fun for me. It's bulk in my fridge for it's size, tough to pour, and cracked where far cheaper pitchers held up. It is pretty though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly as critiqued by other reviewers","review":"The handle is a little short; the stopper works well once you figure out how it works, and it fits perfectly in the door of the refrigerator. Would have preferred it a little taller and not quite as wide, but it works well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pitcher but a little bit heavy","review":"This is a great jug. I am all about the ease of cleaning. I like this jug because of its wide opening. I can hand wash it easily with my hand all the way in it. Or put it in the dishwasher knowing that the water will be able to reach every spot. The only downside is that it is very heavy. That's why I gave only 4 stars. I will still purchase it again though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"I bought this pitcher at William & Sonoma because it was glass and had a top. I wanted to be able to shake up lemonade before pouring. The top (at least on the one they sold at William & Sonoma) does not do a good job of keeping in liquid. What's worse, the pitcher's tiny spout makes it very difficult to pour without spilling. It's hard to believe that a simple pitcher could fall so short of my expectations, but this one has done just that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good pitcher","review":"I wasn't sure if I wanted to get this pitcher because the reviews were so varied. I decided to get it because 1. Glass pitchers with airtight lids are hard to find in stores. 2. I needed the airtight lid for my kefir. 3. I didn't want a huge pitcher taking up space in my fridge. So far, it's just fine. I used a dish brush to wash the inside. I wear medium cleaning gloves and can't get my hand inside with a sponge. No big deal if you soak it first. The lid is easy to use if you take a second to figure it out. The handle is a bit on the small side, but I don't mind. Overall, it's what I wanted so I'm happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent quality and attractive pitcher","review":"This pitcher is an excellent addition to my existing of Frigoverre 1-liter pitchers. The handle is comfortable and holds the pitchers securely in your hands. The lids all seal perfectly, but you have to get the hang of them or they won't seal tightly. The trick to sealing these is to be sure it's fully open when you put it on, then screw it down firmly and it's 100% sealed where you can shake it vigorously without a leak at all. It has to turn farther and go tighter than you think it ought to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reccomend","review":"Good pitcher. Seals tightly. Cleans easily. Only drawback is that the dimensions are not quite accurate, so it did not fit into the space in the door I wanted to use, but did fit on another shelf in the door.

The handle is not a comfortable grip; it's like it is too short for the weight of the glass. The pouring spout stinks; it doesn't pour exactly where you want. The lid is a very nice feature and I wish other glass pitchers had lids like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"No stars","review":"The lid did not seal - it was a waste of money and I threw it out rather than go through the hassle of returning it.

The handle is absolutely the opposite of ergonomic (unless you have tiny hands) and the lid is a marvel of opaque function. Lots of reviews discussing how impossible the lid is to operate but these folks must not be very bright. The lid is simple to operate, just non-obvious. Even so, the lid operation design is terribly overwrought. I could think of a press button mechanism that would be much simpler (probably used on some Tupperware jugs).In summary, it's a work of art in some Italian designer's eye, just not very useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to glass","review":"I always keep instant milk on hand and have been using tupperware pitchers and trying to switch to glass. This is a perfect fit in the fridge. My only complain is I have really small skinny hands and I thought this hand would would perfect for me but even I can barely slide my hand between the handle and container. Why so tight? Just a hair more room between would be more useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"Great little pitcher. Lid does not leak when you tighten it properly. Use it for tea, lemonade and juice. I want another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIP OFF","review":"Why pay $18 when you can get the SAME THING for $11.75 on Amazon titled \\"Frigoverre by Bormioli Rocco\\" -- SAME SIZE TOO. Beware of the warnings by others about the handle and lousy plastic top that doesn't work well; they're right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic. Exactly what I was looking for.","review":"I've always used Britas, but where I live now has great tap water. I wanted a pitcher that I could keep filled with water in the fridge, and this pitcher is exactly what I was looking for. The top seals on top very easily.It was much smaller than I expected it to be when it first arrived, and I was pretty disappointed, but looks are deceiving. It holds about 5-6 large pint glasses worth of water for those that want a reasonable metric."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really like it","review":"When I broke the last of my \\"old style\\" Luminarc 2 liter glass jugs, which I've used for cold water for years, I was dismayed to discover that the new ones have a different lid (at least the couple I bought locally did) - hard plastic instead of the old softer one, they don't seal properly, and the old lids don't fit the new jugs. What to do? After reading the reviews on Amazon for this product, I decided to try it.I love it. Tight sealing lid (easy to use, thanks to instructions in previous reviews), it fits in the awkward space between the vegetable bins and the meat/cheese drawer in my fridge, and I have no trouble with the handle, probably because I have slender fingers even though I have big hands. A bit of practice and I can pour without spilling. Also, seems much sturdier than my old Luminarcs, although that remains to be seen. Either way, from now on, this is my cold-water jug of choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for sun tea","review":"I bought this product to make sun tea and it's perfect. I like that it is thick glass with a locking lid and fits well in the dishwasher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally... A compact glass pitcher!","review":"I liked this pitcher so much that I bought a second one. I use it for my brewed tea. After reading the reviews warning against pouring boiling water in it, I let the kettle cool for about 5 mins before pouring the hot water in. The water is still hot enough to steep tea. So far, so good! I haven't had any issues. Thick glass, great lid. LOVE IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to pour without spilling","review":"It takes some patience and care to pour with this pitcher, without ending up with some spills on the table.However, my wife seems like this pitcher (mostly because it's glass).I found that if you hold the cup on one hand, pitcher on the other, and hold the cup up so the rim is touching the the pitcher below the lip, with the pitcher touching the rim of the cup, pour slowly and lift gently when finish, then it might not spill. Oh, keep a towel ready too. :-)Oh, it's on the heavy side too especially when filled with water."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't even get to use it once!","review":"I poured hot water (not boiling, hot) into the warm pitcher, and the damn thing broke into pieces. When I grabbed the handle to clear some of the mess, the top of the pitcher broke off, leaving the bottom lying in a puddle of hot water and glass shards. A complete waste. Not sure what all the super fans are doing differently, but a pitcher with such good reviews should be able to handle the iced tea process. The $5 pitcher I was trying to replace held up better. Since I can't put no stars, let's say the one star is for the shape. It's nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks at high temperatures","review":"I bought this pitcher 4 years ago. It worked like a dream. I tend to make hot tea and at the time on a gas stove. Little did I know that on an electric stove I would have this problem but when I make tea, the temperature is so hot that it shatters the glass. I bought another one and the same thing happened this morning. Low temps it works great, higher temps it breaks be warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Glass Pitcher!","review":"I love this pitcher. It has a wide enough top and not so deep that I can wash the inside easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for everyday use!!!","review":"I bought four of these to store filtered water from our portable RO filter to replace our plastic jugs (and get more away from using plastic). These work great for occasional use but I would not recommend for daily use. The pouring lip is small so you have to be deliberate and careful when pouring liquids or they will pour down the front side of the jar and makes a sloppy mess. The top MUST be completely removed for use but works great in sealing the jar.I only recommend using for storage and occasional use. Also, each jar only holds a little over gallon and I wish they came in 1-gallon size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"This is a well constructed jug and it has worked very well. It would be even better if it had a slightly larger spout so that I could pour faster."},{"rating":"2","title":"bormioli rocco frigoverre glass pitcher","review":"it is a nice heavy duty glass pitcher with a lid to keep out other fridge odors. very easy to clean comparred to plastic ones that get stained over time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Pitcher","review":"For all those who are sick (no pun intended) of chinese plastic, this is the perfect answer! Top is not a problem and pouring for most (I guess) is just tilt and pour."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pitcher","review":"This is a great pitcher. It's compact, therefore, doesn't take up too much space in the refrigerator. Perfect for making sun tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boom","review":"Boom it's the BOMB! Ya, if you looked forever for a pitcher (for me to fit between shelves in a new bottom freezer fridge) this is the pitcher for you. The lid should be hand washed and it does seal well by the way and I haven't had any messy issues with pouring the spout seems to work well. I should note this isn't tall enough that I would want it to put in a door bin but the low height makes it perfect for my juices on a regular shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like this pitcher a lot","review":"I really like this pitcher. It fits nicely into the door of my fridge and has a nice air tight seal. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the lid must be taken off completely to pour. It's not that big of a deal but some people may prefer to be able to pour with the lid still on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I love this product. After breaking the first one (Completely my fault -- I poured a hot liquid into the sink with the jug after pulling it from the refrigerator. Not my smartest idea.), I didn't hesitate to purchase another. It holds a lot of liquid and the seal on the jug keeps things fresh. The only downsides I've noticed is that the handle is a bit small compared to the rest of the container and it does get a bit heavy when filled."},{"rating":"1","title":"DANGEROUS","review":"DANGER! Unsafe product -- do not use with hot liquids! I wanted to make iced tea so I took this pitcher off the shelf, put some tea bags in, and poured in hot water (to brew, and then cool down and ice later). The pitcher literally exploded spilling 42 or 50 ounces or whatever it is of boiling water all over my legs and feet. As it was a hot day, I was in shorts and no shoes, so it all went straight to skin. I got a significant burn on my right leg, the tops of both feet and a small burn on my left leg. Zero stars -- unsafe product, definitely not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 liter jug","review":"Love this jug and the lid is great. It pours nice also. Couldn't have ask for better.

Save your money and get a bigger one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy and Air Tight!","review":"I love this thing. It is important to be able to put liquids in the refrigerator and not have other odors invade the beverage. This does the trick.

Lid works well and is easy to clean, there is a little dripping after pouring, but that seems to happen with glass, also a little heavy because it is glass, but so much better than platic..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pitcher but wish it was taller and held more","review":"This pitcher is a little small - but then the manufacturer probably wanted to keep the weight down. It is easy to open & close (hold the outer rim of the plastic lid while turning the part in the middle) & it has a gasket inside to seal the lid. The gasket is REMOVABLE - I remove and wash it each time I wash the pitcher, so I don't have to worry about any liquid getting under the gasket and growing mold.I did notice that one reviewer had two of these and both of them cracked. I'm saving my receipt and if that happens I'll be very disappointed. Hopefully that was caused by a bad batch at the manufacturing plant.I prefer to store food and liquid in glass rather than plastic, and this is the only pitcher I have found that is glass and has a tight sealing lid."},{"rating":"1","title":"The lid really is annoying!","review":"When I read the reviews for this product, I was skeptical of the people who criticized the lid. But, it really is annoying to the point that I don't use the pitcher anymore. We figured out how it works - it is tricky because you kind of have to hold the outside ring of the lid in place while you turn the inside. I don't have a problem getting a tight seal (except that it can be hard to push in), but I struggle with getting it open. I still can't figure out if you're supposed to be able to pour with the lid on (obviously after opening the spout part of it) or if the lid has to come completely off in order to pour things. It seems to work differently every time we use it. If you tend to have issues with opening things (like pickle jars), this is definitely not for you. All things considered, while I can make this pitcher work, it really shouldn't be this difficult, so I am going to get rid of it and buy a new pitcher that I like better."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect Frigoverre Pitcher","review":"Very pleased with these Frigoverre Pitchers. The tops are different than the set my mother had 15 or so years ago in that they will seal tightly. The feature of the tops was important to me. Very handy size and shape fitting into the door of refrigerator too. Highly recommend anyone to purchase these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"Our pitcher arrived unscathed, however we were never able to pour with the lid on. We tried everything and were only able to pour with the lid removed. A few days after purchase and the lid broke the plastic handle snapped right off and will not turn anymore. Nice glass pitcher...terrible lid. Very disappointed. Not the usual high quality We have come to expect with our Amazon purchases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks nice but the lid doesnt fit","review":"Looks nice. I like the square shaped base. However, the lid does not fit. It's supposed to increase in diameter when twisted so that the rubber seal will push tightly around the mouth, but even at the widest setting it doesnt come close to fitting properly. So the lid is basically useless except for keeping bugs out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't cram 78oz of water into this jug","review":"Glass appears ok, haven't tried it with hot water yet. However, the capacity listed at 78.2 oz is MIS-LEADING. Only 72oz can be placed into this jug. And, that volume brings the water to the bottom of the lid. I'm tired of company's ripping off consumers with false descriptions, they shouldn't be allowed on amazon, let 'em go over to ebay to sell their junk. Also, the handle is very close, narrow fingers might be needed to hold the pitcher, just before you return it!If you're looking for a true pitcher, capable of 78oz+ capacity, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"lid that requires instructions? pour spout that dribbles? never again","review":"it doesn't pour properly, and it doesn't seal properly...the only 2 reasons i bought an italian overpriced pitcher. if these are the basic requirements you have of a pitcher, then don't buy this one. save your money and buy anchor hocking. i'm now using all frigoverre pitchers for dry goods storage only. i'm also disappointed about my frigoverre food storage pieces----you can't use them in the oven! pyrex and anchor hocking are WAY better quality, way better lids, and MADE IN USA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived Broken","review":"My order was fulfilled by Westview Traders. Unfortunately I cannot find any contact info for them because I would have liked to have given them a chance to correct my order.

I would have been happy with just a replacement but the option wasn't available for me since my order was originally fulfilled by Westview Traders. From all the other reviews, I honestly think this pitcher would have been great. Just don't buy it if it's being offered by Westview Traders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glass broke with boiling water","review":"This pitcher broke when I tried to make iced tea in it.

You literally have to pour with your finger tips."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not airtight","review":"I bought these containers because I buy the 3 liter bottles of soda from the dollar store and the bottles are so big they don't fit in my fridge. These bottles do not keep the carbonation in the soda. I was very disappointed and now it is past the time I have to return the products on amazon. These are fine as just glass pitchers if you want to put water in them or something but don't work for soda or other things where you really need a tight seal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Pitchers not the thin stuff","review":"These are good pitchers I was afraid that these would be thin and easy broken since I can not see them up close. I read one review that said they was thicker. I have been using these for some time now and love them they are thicker so they wont break by getting dings, not real tall so they fit in the fridge better, and have a wide mouth, and glass. They will be used for a very long time. The cap is made of rubber and plastic but thats it. One day you hear of bad stuff in plastic then they remove it and say its safe ( no BPA ) just read in Mens Health that even the BPA free plastic has several health risks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Pitcher","review":"I like the pitcher!

Now I'm looking for a bigger one for 48 oz. of orange juice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Jar","review":"This is an amazing jar. I use it to store my juice for my juice fast. Many of the reviews I read on Amazon are not fair to this amazing jar! They confuse the opening and closing process which is very simple: Once placing the top on the Jar you hold the outer part of the top while turning the center piece in the top clock wise toclose and lock the airtight jar, to open ityou do everything the same way except you turn the center piece in the top counter clock wise! It's that simple and because of this little jar I've bought a whole set of Bormioli jars ranging for 2 to 4 liters. Again, a great jar, ignore any review that tells you otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's the fuss? They're great.","review":"I ordered the 68 oz pitchers and I can't imagine what the fuss that's been kicked up is about...They are FANTASTIC. The handles are fine.

We plan on buying the whole set, or most of them, they are made really well too something that is hard to find these days... For the people that had trouble with the lid, stop eating paint chips..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have read more reviews....","review":"Glass needs to be properly tempered, which helps protect it from breakage, including when using it with hot or cold temperatures. From reading more of the reviews it appears that many people found that this product is not tempered well -- breaking all the time. And I should have read these.Instead when I opened the package, I got cut three times from a shard of glass, about the size of half a penny, that was hanging off the spout. Painful, but I thought it was just a left over piece of glass from the mold. But it turns out it was a piece that had pulled away from the spout leaving sharp edges. Yikes.Amazon came through and refunded me, but I won't buy from this manufacturer again, which is too bad since I was thinking of getting more jugs in this and other sizes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I really looked long and hard for the right pitcher for my rice milk, I did not like keeping it in the cardboard box that it came in, I wanted something that fit in the door of the fridge. fits great and I like that the opening is large enough to clean out. I only wished that it did not dribble down the front after pouring from it. I also love the seal works great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this pitcher","review":"I love this pitcher! I recently decided that I was finished with plastic storage containers. I was concerned with how much plastic may have been leaching into my orange juice? So I searched for a glass pitcher that would fit into my refrig and cleanup easily either in the dishwasher or sink. When I got it in the mail I read the directions....but I don't remember reading about how the cover can totally be taken apart for cleaning. There is a narrow plastic piece that snaps on the top of the cover and holds it together. When I was cleaning it in the sink for the first time, I somehow unsnapped it and I thought I had broken the cover. What a delight to discover it wasn't broken the cover totally disassembles so you can clean it with ease. I am going to buy another one for my RV.Some have said that the handle is small....yes it is a little tight to the bottle but I don't have large hands so it's not a problem for me.Awesome product! Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really nice pitcher","review":"Seems sturdy, well made. The lid seals tightly enough that you can tip it or turn it upside down without spilling a drop.

But after only a few weeks, it will no longer seal. I've washed it only by hand, I tried removing the rubber ring to ensure it's clean underneath, my husband tried it...it just will no longer seal. If someone explain this and tell me how to fix it, I'd be glad to upgrade my rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pitcher that can't pour!","review":"When I saw this product, I was ecstatic. Finally a big GLASS pitcher with a lid! When I got it, I immediately made fresh lemonade. I poured. Lemonade spilled all over my linen tablecloth. Hmm. Just carelessness? I tried again. Spilled again. It turns out the shape of the pitcher's lip is just not suited for POURING. Go figure. Now I use it to store grains and beans--DRIED stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lid does not fit!","review":"I purchased this for my husband for christmas along with a high power juicer. I wrapped it up and put it under the tree without inspecting it much. I sure with I had. The glass part of the jug is great but the lid does not work. You are supposed to turn it and the rubber gasket moves to \\"close\\" and \\"open\\". The one I got stay open no matter which way it is turned so the lid just lays on top and does not seal. Very disappointed that I can't return it because it has been over 30 days since purchase and my husband opening it for Christmas.

This isn't as complicated to use as everyone claims, and mine DID come with instructions.

I like the shape, but sadly, I found this guy leaked on me fairly often. Not my fave."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lid breaks easily","review":"I love everything about this pitcher except for the lid, which kind of ruins everything else. I like how it looks, I like the thick glass, I'm fine with the handle. THE LID: I understand it's supposed to seal and then you take it off to pour. Mine broke (something in it snapped) within the first two weeks of use, so there is no sealing anymore. Also, most people who are not used to using it (like guests) expect to pour it with the lid on, which creates a disaster (lots of spilled liquid) if someone besides yourself tries to serve themselves with it. If it had a different lid, I would buy this again. My spouse hates it, but I've learned to live with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great practical glass pitcher","review":"I love this glass pitcher! It's big enough for me to put green tea and leave it in the refrigerator for my fiance. He likes it nice and cool.

This pitcher hasn't met that fate yet, and it is better than other pitchers I've used in the past for two major reasons. First, lemonade and ice tea and other beverages don't leave lingering smells (a problem I always had with plastic pitchers, even after washing in the dishwasher). Secondly, the vacuum seal lid keeps the liquids fresher longer, and the fridge doesn't smell like whatever is in the pitcher. It also looks pretty classy.

The plastic top is a clever design, and the you can tighten the gasket enough to make it spill proof. But, after using it for a week or so, I'm inclined to just leave the top off completely--it's really not necessary for my use and it's just more trouble than it's worth.The form is kind of smallish and squarish, which I figured, but \\"in-person\\" it still surprised me. It does hold 2 liters though and it fits nicely into the refrigerator without having to use one of the tall shelves.

I grew up watching old movies on tv and love films that depend on character development, dialogue, and good actors. This film filled these criteria well.I was especially intrigued by Eddie Redmayne. I had seen him in BirdsongMasterpiece Classic: Birdsongand he didn't overly impress me, but he really excelled in this part. He plays the goofy young man so effectively. He immersed himself in his portrayal of Gordy so much you would never guess that he was educated at Eton and Cambridge.The other two primary actors were very also good. William Hurt always performs to a high standard. I found his protrayal of Brett to be sensitive, compassionate and strong. And no other actress plays the conflicted young woman as well as Kristen Stewart.It's unfortunate that this film isn't better known. It is a touching story, well acted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romance and Road Show-Good Stuff!","review":"Was not certain about this movie after reading the Amazon review---fortunately went through all the customer reviews and bought the flick.Am a long time fan of WH and have seen several of Kristen Stewart's films but Eddie Redmayne and Maria Bello was not familiar with.This cast a great ensemble, they portrayed their roles and interacted well in giving us a view of the charactor traits in this story.Good flick, and perhaps the second best portrayal Ms. Stewart has given us.Twilight did not challenge her, this role did, along withWelcome to the Rileys.This is a good flick--"},{"rating":"2","title":"A rare treasure","review":"Composer Charles Koechlin, 1867-1950, one of the underrated geniuses of modern music, has written some of the most challenging, thrilling and interesting music for the modern flute. The dynamic range of his music, from passionate lyricism to explosive, angular motifs has been a great gift to the modern flute, extending its range and expressivness. Fenwick Smith plays this music with great finesse and conviction on his self-made Powell flute, accompanied expertly by Martin Amlin, piano; Leone Buyse, flute; and Jayne West, soprano. Recorded in 1988 and 1989 on the Helios Hyperion label it is a timeless treasure for all adventerous music lovers and flute players. This CD is a bargain at thrice the price.

All ads say that it can wash, \\"Wash a shirt, slacks, shorts and a pair of socks in one load\\". I have not found this to be true. It's great for socks and underwear, but groans if I try and put anything more than a couple of shirt or one pair of slacks/jeans in a one time.

You still have to either hand rinse the clothes or run them thru the machine again a few times in clean water.This washer is great for doing last-minute items, stained clothes that need to be washed NOW, if you can't scrape enough quarters together for the laundrymat, or if going to the laundrymat or having a regular size washing machine is not feasable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scratchy fabric","review":"This comforter was a Christmas gift for my son and he couldn't be happier with it.

Instead it seeks to build public sympathy for five young men referred to as boys or children throughout the film. These \\"boys\\" have been convicted and sentenced for attacking two other \\"children\\" in their own back yard, stabbing them and killing one. The premise of the film, that the convicted \\"boys\\" serving life sentences for the homicide have been railroaded through a miscarriage of justice, is never given legs.

I however, experienced \\"hot flashes\\". Phenomenal performances by all. Opera lovers must hear and see this and shouldn't be prudish just because the executioner is a bloody naked mess - you would be too if you had to behead someone; and at that, a radical who unbeknown to himself seduced princess Salome and has remained immortal in religious history for a few thousand years.

Soprano Michaels, sometimes off pitch, performs a better Salome as an actress than as a singer. Volle performs a wonderful Jochanaan and the rest of the cast is ok. Stage design is really powerful but a dissapointing regie, specially at the seven veils' dance. The orchetra directed by Phillippe Jordan makes this Salome almost a masterpiece after Solti's Salome (with Nilsson, for me the perfect Salomé.)I have two other Salome sung by Malfitano but this ie better than both of them.

Not just an entertaining action adventure story of one man against the sea but a story that will get you thinking; and not always comfortable thoughts.

It's not that it's poorly written. Had it been, I'd have stopped with one try. No, my trouble with the book is that its every character is so incredibly unpleasant. Stone would appear to think the world is made up of nasty, self-absorbed, unhappy, manipulative people.I don't consider myself particularly optimistic about the human race, but if Stone sees his fellow humans in such an unremittingly negative light, I pity him."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disillusioning Waste Of Time","review":"Nicely drawn characters; good writing; different and compelling story.

In most stories, there is at least one character that you can identify with - even if it isn't the author's intended goal. In this book, they are all pathetic losers on a fast track to Nowhere Land.

Otherwise, don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"A total waste of time","review":"I've never read a book like this before. And I hope I never do again!

I appreciated his ability to make words work hard for him. Having spent quite a bit of time in many of the places mentioned in the writings, I had a personal connection with the book; he tackled the slums of Calcutta and the burning ghats of Benares with the utmost ease, and I found myself reading with a mix of wonder and bittersweet reminiscence.Sadly, his daily drug addiction casts a shadow over spiritual nature of the journey, and even he seems to allude to the fact that he is clouded and limited in his insights because of it.

If he made it up, he's a traitor to his own people, spreading lies about Americans. This book will surface somewhere, and show him to be the two-faced person he is.

So, for any doubting Thomases--yes, I read the book!This thing is an atrocity in the world of literature. First of all, it is reminiscent of a bad Time/Life collection piece. If anything, Kerry's portion was probably written by an underpaid speechwriter for the political wannabe. It is biased propoganda, and except for those purchasing an oddity for their personal shelves, should only be read by those society misfits who would not be able to afford the $595 pricetag anyway.

And here's the caption the right wingers evidently didn't want anyone to see:\\"It was Thursday night, after the candlelight march, when the guys came back and were on stage with the flag. There was this spontaneous feeling of pride. I sort of drew a parallel with Iwo Jima. I guess you had to, because it was with the same type of pride that they put up the flag in Iowa Jima. And when it was done - instead of burning the flag, they took it and they folded it up because as Phil Lavoie, one of the vets with the flag said, 'We love America, we're not here to destroy it.'\\"Now, why wouldn't they want you to know that?"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great book","review":"I really like this book a lot.

One deranged person, maybe, but not a dozen or two, in a book that will be around for generations.I would never have been aware of this old snapshot of the past, if those so offended by it had not made such a stink about it. Carrying the flag upside down? Horrors! Everyone should know that that is a signal of distress.

It paints the entire Vietnam war as American troops torturing, killing, mutilating, raping, civilians. When there not doing that, they are shooting babies. Not much actual war fighting, just a lot of massacres. You really must read this book. Its scary. Kerry could be the future president. You should know what you are in for. Don't listen to the picture tells it all viewpoint. It would be like being in 1930's and you could read Hitlers book MEIN KAMPF and find out his plans for war.

The model is not all that different from simply taking a 10 year average of year-low P/Es and multiplying that by expected earnings or most recent earnings. See pg. 68 & 69. As for the flimsy prose: it's an obvious rush-job, with cute bios of the Dow companies, multiple spelling mistakes, and errors and obfuscations in the data which even Mr. Lee's admirers at the Fool site were quick to remedy. Basically, this is a first draft of what could, with a little effort, be a first rate book. Mr. Kee has been extremely generous, modest, and balanced in his appearances at the Fool discussions -- I hope he will apply the same dedication to improving the second edition -- for this book deserves a second edition.

The in depth discussion of the history of each Dow stock is useful although somewhat boring to anyone but a real blue chip fanatic. There are two irritating limitations to the method in the book, namely there is no guidance on when to sell, i.e. when a stock becomes too overvalued and should be rotated into a new stock. The other flaw is that the 10-year average price/book is calculated incorrectly. However the method is the method and if it works, it works! Calculating the average P/B correctly merely has the effect of giving lower (more conservative) target buy prices for high growth stocks. Using this method as a screening tool for large cap value stocks is a useful investment tool to have, and keeping the above limitations in mind, the book is well worth having."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trouncing the Dow Big Time in 2000","review":"FYI...the benchmark investing strategy introduced in Trouncing the Dow is living up to its reputation thus far in 2000.

Discussion of these methods would have made a good feature length magazine article in a $3.95 magazine but fall short of justifying writing a $24.95 book. Most of the book consists of charts and detailed analysis of Dow stocks over a period of two decades to show that the method works. A single page summary would have sufficed.

An obessive desire to interpret virtually every fable or fact of hinduism using freud's psyco-analytical theories brings to light truely ridiculous conclusions. It is a well known fact that the Manu-smriti is not the final say of indian laws and opinions.

I found the characters boring along with the entire story. Definately not one of her best efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Thsi story was not good enough to follow the beautiful love story between Courtney and Chandos(Casey's mom and pop). Damian just was not sexy enough, and I liked Casey but there comes a point when she is just too headstrong and she stops focusing on her goals. Lindsey is one of my favorites, but I will stick with her older stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"This book just does not have the spark of Johanna's previous books, particulary those from the Malory Series. The characters don;t have any depth, the storyline is unbelievable and most importantly there is no anticipation and excitement which I expect from a romance. I was very disappointed in this book - don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"good read","review":"Johanna Lindsey doesn't disappoint you with this sequel to A Heart So Wild, although I will admit to enjoying the parents story more."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING, lindsey has disppointed me again!!","review":"Lindsey's last two novels have both been published first in hardcover. What a rip-off!! I have totally enjoyed her previous books--both of these last works \\"say you love me\\" and this one work better than tranquilizers as far as putting an insomniac to sleep. Come on Ms Lindsey, you can do better than this. Please bring back the charisma associated with previous characters and the electricity between the hero and heroine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"Rarely am I ever disappointed with Johanna Lindsey's books, but this book is a rarity! The characters were shallow, never allowing me to get to know them or understand them. The subplot of Casey Stanton's parents relationship, and I am being very generous calling this a subplot, was the most interesting element. I thought I couldn't wait for this to be in paperback-I should have! After being thoroughly pleased with her last book, I have gone from one extreme to the other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quickly Lost Interest","review":"I was very disappointed with the book. It quickly lost my interest and I found myself skipping several pages at a time without losing anything out of the story. Johanna Lindsey has written much better stories than this one. The story was boring, the characters were boring and there didn't seem to be any reason for their attraction to each other. I wish I had waited for the paperback, this one was definitely not worth the price of a hardback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to her old standards","review":"I thought this book was going to be lots of fun. Unfortunately, the characters made big mistakes that distracted from the fun. The heroine comes across as childish. And the hero acts like a know-it-all, even though he's a tenderfoot.Even worse, the last part of the book is anticlimatic. After Casey and Damian solve their main problem, the book starts to drag.If you want to enjoy a Lindsey, reread one of your favorites instead of buying this one. I gave this one a D+ at All About Romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"another Lindsey pleaser","review":"I loved this, but I love all of Johanna Lindsey's books. This was a great read. Casey is an amusing and thoroughly real heroine. Her struggles and minor character flaws endear her to you and create a believable atmosphere. The description of her travelling on her own as a bounty hunter give you a truly detailed glimpse into her nature."},{"rating":"1","title":"could not finish it","review":"Yet another disappointment! I believe this will be the last Lindsey book I ever pick up. I really liked the concept but again, poorly written. The characters are irritatingly one dimensional. They are constantly bickering and without the sexual tension that makes a romance novel tick. I couldn't even finish reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not worth the time it takes to read","review":"I would like to say that I've been a fan for years and have always paid to have one of Ms. Lindsey's books as soon as it came out because I knew I could count on a wonderful read. Well, she can't expect me to buy on her name alone anymore. She has been cranking out too many disappointments. Ms. Lindsey should take more time and give us a worthy book to read. (Especially if she wants to keep us paying for hardcovers)."},{"rating":"2","title":"I guess it was O.K.","review":"It wasn't as good as: \\"Man of My Dreams\\" or \\"Once a Princess\\", but it was much better than \\"Say You Love Me\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad Sequel","review":"I was very excited when I saw that this book was coming out, as the story of Courtney and Chandos has been one of my favorite JL stories (reread many times). What an absolute disaster this book is. The chemistry, romance and fire of Courtney and Chandos was lost on their daughter! I had never been disappointed by a JL till I read this one. I still reread the old ones - and hope that she can recapture that style in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, rambling plot; knuckle-headed heroine","review":"This novel had a boring, rambling, largely unbelieveable plot that consisted mostly of characters wandering on and off trains and in and out of saloons. The heroine seemed not so much feisty and independent as knuckle-headed; the hero had little depth and his shallow character simply changed to fit the plot's demands. Especially annoying was the fact that, had the two central characters cared enough about each other to actually talk to each other--even once--the numerous contrived misunderstandings would not have occurred. The novel's saving grace is the small subplot involving Chandos and Courteney. Despite the little space they are given in this novel, their relationship is tender and honest, and the author clearly cares for them. All in all, I believe that if this had been the author's first novel, it would have been a tough sell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho hum","review":"I agree with one of the other reviewers. Every time I pick up a Lindsey, in my heart I'm looking for another Captive Bride or Fires of Winter. This one was a VERY boring and vastly unbelievable story. But, when your're listening on cassette while driving to work, even marginal stories are OK. I was quite glad it was only 3 cassettes, however, so I can go on to better things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a keeper, that's for sure","review":"I just finished this book and must say I'm glad I checked it out from the library instead of shelling out $22! This story was dry and uninteresting, and like another reviewer, I found myself skipping pages merely to get to the end faster. I have read better Lindsey books, and hope that her last couple of novels are not an indication that her good writing days are over."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want good Lindsey, go back and read her first books","review":"Lindsey has fallen into formula hell with this book. The characters were cardboard cutouts and \\"typical\\", people Lindsey never would have included in her earlier works. Where are the glory days of \\"Captive Bride?\\" and \\"Fires of Winter\\". Lindsey has been replaced in her spot as innovator in the romance world. Her characters are no more developed than those of the weekld made-for-TV battered woman movie. After collecting Lindsey's novels for more than ten years, I have now come to the terrible conclusion that she has become a shadow of her former self. Maybe she should wait even longer than one year between her books. Maybe she should wait until they're worth reading. Those who do (Laura Kinsale, et al) are those whom I'll be spending my $$ on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I love Johanna Lindsey, and was anxious to read her most recent.

It brings back all the memories from late 60's/early 70's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It","review":"One of the first songs I learned to play on guitar was I'd Love to Change the World. Had it on vinyl and hadn't heard it for years. Still stands as a classic guitar riff. If you enjoy going back to some of the old stuff, this is a great recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ten Years After, A Space In Time. Very good but it took more than one time listening to it to really appreciate it.","review":"The first time I listened to the album I thought the album was alright. I love \\"I'd Love to Change The World\\" and that song hit me right in the heart and the rest of the album was alright. By the time I listened to the album about three times I came to the conclusion that the album was great and now I do not understand why it did not hit my fancy at first like it does now. I would fully recommend it to anyone that like rock and roll music. It is good and could be cherished by anyone that likes music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated Talent","review":"Alvin Lee and company shine again.. Terrific classic album..

Good music from a very talented musician!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good collection.","review":"Overall I liked this short story collection. Most of the stories are clever and well written.There are a couple of stories that consist of their authors getting up on a soap box and whining about how horrible the human race is, but for the most part the stories range from decent to excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what is represented","review":"This is a fine film about running breaking seas over inlet bars in planing boats. If it were marketed as such, I would give it four stars. It is NOT about heavy weather boat handling. If you think this dvd will help teach you to survive bad weather at sea while cruising offshore, as the title and description suggest, you will be disapointed. If you want to learn to safely cross a breaking bar in small-medium size outboard skiffs and power catamarans, you will enjoy this dvd, in the unlikely event that you order it, given the misleading title."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing.","review":"This album is absolutely worth 19 dollars. After watching the movie, I knew I'd have to lay my hands on the score as soon as possible. All the tracks are fantastic, although I don't think that the track 'Mass Vehicular Carnage' has anything to do with the rest of the CD, because it's basically a rap song.My favourite tracks are 'The Island Awaits You', 'This Tongue Thing's Amazing', 'Mass Winnings' and 'My Name Is Lincoln'. I'd say that if you like Hans Zimmer's music, this CD is definitely a good buy for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Minor Possibilities","review":"Most of the music on this CD seems disjointed, however the track \\"My Name is Lincoln\\" seems to fully convey the theme of the movie climax, and along with track number 10, these pieces of music are quite beautiful. Also track 11, has some possibility too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only one decent song","review":"There's only one coherent actual song on this CD. The rest is just a collection of sound effects and short music bits. If you want that one song, the nice one at the very end, fine, but it's too bad there aren't more like it. I think they could have done better. I remember liking the movie soundtrack a lot - I don't think it translates very well to CD, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Track 14 / Worth the price of the CD","review":"I agree with other reviewers here -- much of the music on the CD is simply supplemental to the film, is forgetable, nothing really stands out, there is a lack of melody. Only one track (# 14) \\"My Name is Lincoln\\" -- stands apart, offering a theme, melody, choir and resolution -- it is a signature bit of composing that, for me, is really worth the price of the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I primarily bought this soundtrack for the song, My Name Is Lincoln and I've fallen in love with the whole CD. I've been listening to it on my MP3 player ever since I received it, a week ago. I can't stop listening to it... the majestic ambience is awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated entertainment.","review":"A very sudden and uplifting soundtrack, modern, even a little metallic but not too moody. The movie itself was underrated entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I absolutely LOVE the Soundtrack. The first time i watched the Movie, i was so drawn into it because of the music. Yes, there are some songs that wern't on my \\"A\\" list, but then with some others, it just takes my breath away.The orchestra is strong and intense. At times you can say that its my \\"meditation\\" music, because I relax the most when I listen to it.To me, it was an absolute enjoyment, to others it might not be, because they only like the music cause it \\"went well\\" with the movie and that was how they came to get the soundtrack.Because I am a devoted fan to the movie \\"The Island\\" I loved it :)My most favorite song out of the whole sound track is \\"My Name Is Lincoln\\" as well as \\"This Tongue Thing's Amazing\\" are my most absolute favorite!"},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars for two great songs","review":"I love this version of Pallet. I think it is MJH's best version of his best song. Can't get enough of that guitar pickin'.Coming in Glory is also great. Sounds like they are in the room with you.Five stars for each of those two.

From my perspective they are much easier than the regular Polly Pocket clothes - my kids can change the clothes themselves - without my having to do it for them.

Then, the mechanism that slides up and down (to do the \\"magic\\" of dressing the Polly Pocket) jammed in the \\"down\\" position... for good. Our daughter was quite distressed. She was using it VERY carefully (I was watching her when it died), so it did not fail due to misuse. I have worked on this thing for a couple of hours, without taking it apart (yet), all to no avail. There is no visible cause for why it's jammed, but at this point, it's nothing more than a frustrating piece of junk. If I get it fixed, or Mattel sends a replacement, I'll update my review if I can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous tiny magnets!","review":"The tiny magnets embedded in many of the small accessories fall out!

Otherwise, steer clear of this unsafe product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun for a short amount of time","review":"When I got this toy I figured it would be a blast. It was at first.

Well we were sadly disappointed. We put the doll into the dressing room and placed the clothes onto the spots where they belong. We pulled the thing to make the doll come out dressed and the clothes did not go onto her like they showed on the commercial. The dolls cannot stand up or bend. I wish this toy was made alot better. I must say on a positive note that the pieces to dress the dolls with are really cute and I love how they go onto the hangers. I would not have this toy around when small children are present because some of the pieces are REALLY TINY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not fun","review":"Lots of problems. First, the dressing elevator doesn't work, for the Polly comes out undressed ever time, and her feet do not fit in the shoes. Second, the clothes rack can only hold three outfits, for if you put more on they stick together. Don't buy this toy, and just buy the basic pollys."},{"rating":"1","title":"why did I get this?","review":"Hi to start I hate this toy! On the commercial it moved so quickly that I had to get it but now I wish I hadn't. It took me forever just to figure out how to load the clothes. And you have to move it so slowly when she comes out of the curtiuns. Very rarely does she come out with all of her clothes on! and Polly is stiff. The magnet came out of one of her pigtails and one of her hair flowers. Well anyway it's a really bad toy so don't get it!!

The kids were excited to try the toy out right away, but soon discovered that it was not as easy as the commercial makes it appear. (is anything?) Polly's clothes hang rather precariously from the \\"changer\\" by two very weak magnets. It can be difficult to keep the clothes in place long enough to push the changer into position. Polly has to be carefully adjusted into her shoes before pushing her into the changing room. Sometimes it takes a couple of tries before she comes out dressed. The kids didn't seem to mind the trial and error phase at first, but eventually gave up and just manually stuck Polly's clothes to her. Also, this toy doesn't work with the other Pollys you have at home. It requires the special magnetized doll.All in all, this seems like too much fuss and bother just to dress a doll."},{"rating":"1","title":"yuck...","review":"This doll is a rip-off! My little sister got this for her birthday. There is only 1 doll that can wear the clothes and get them on. She cannot move! She can't sit in the car, stand up, or wear most of any of the other Polly clothes. The Quik Click thing is just stupid. It takes a less amount of time to just put the clothes on manually! And more than 3/4 of the time the clothes don't go on! The commercial is a lie. The clothes don't go on so fast and you have to reload-it doesn't do it itself.

From time I put these shoes on I knew that I was going down hill. But the reviews from other customers was so wonderful, that I thought well maybe it's just me. So, I decided to were them to a day long festival. I would have walked barefoot back home,if i could have. These shoes are so very uncomfortable and they feel that like they were not properly made. However I did not return them in the 30 days and reading other customers complaints I realize that I am just out of luck.

This is the only shoe I buy - white and black."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really pleased with these shoes","review":"I was very hesitant to invest this much money in a pair of shoes, but I'm glad I did. I work in the ER and I am sometimes on my feet a lot. I had tried New Balance for several years, but even those shoes that were designed for arch support were inadequate. With the Spiras I no longer have to use arch support insoles. While I can't say that all of my plantar fasciitis pain is gone, it is very much improved. Don't expect an improvement immediately, it's taken a month for my feet to adjust to the shoes and for my pain to improve. Also be aware that these shoes run a little wide. I ordered a wide width shoe, however Amazon mistakenly shipped me a regular width shoe. After a month, however, the shoe feels fine. Initially my right pinkie toe was feeling a little squished (apparently the right is my wider foot), however now the shoes fit very comfortably."},{"rating":"1","title":"they don't flex at toes","review":"Great except for one very important problem: They don't flex at all in the toe region.

I decided to purchase these Spira shoes based on online reviews in May 2010. My initial impression was very good and I rated the shoes this way. However, I was recently wearing the shoes and the left one became very noisy. I thought I picked up a little stone in the shoe. Kept walking. Then the shoe started a low pitched squeek. When I got home I discovered a 3\\" x 1/4\\" hole in the sole of the left shoe, exposing a metal plate. I have never experienced this problem after wearing walking shoes for such a short period of time, and have returned them for a full refund. Perhaps my shoe was defective and this is not a reflection on Spira. But I will not purchased this brand again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what they're cracked up to be","review":"They are nothing more than any other shoe that I've bought at a local shoe store for half the money. They really aren't anything special to warrent the price. Although they fit my narrow feet well, I can't be truely happy with them. My knees still hurt after work every day and the inside isn't as comforting as they were promised to be. There is no spring action that I can feel, but I can surely hear the squeek with every step I take. My advice is save the money! These shoes are not worth this price!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Good Looking Shoe","review":"I ordered this shoe for a trip to Ireland. I was disappointed because it didn't look like the picture. It had no heel and look like an orthopedic shoe. I'm sure it was comfortable but it wasn't appealing to me.

I am now spoiled; putting other shoes on feel like walking on a brick, whereas these are flexible and cushiony."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Crime","review":"This is a very worthwhile read for anyone who is interested in the Depression era, particularly in gangsters of the period. The fact that it is a \\"graphic novel\\" may be distracting to some, but nevertheless, it is a well crafted story that tells the events of of the massacre at Kansas City's Union Station that allowed J. Edgar Hoover to gain the publicity and clout he needed to fully arm his G-men and be given a free hand in law enforcement from that day forward. FBI men even today will still swear that Pretty Boy Floyd was at the scene, despite a good amount of evidence to the contrary. IF one is to nitpick, the only failings of this book is that by creating fictional characters and putting some real people in places they were not (which the author Ande Parks admits in his notes), it undoes the very thing it seems to set out to do, which is do an authentic, factual retelling of the true story. Overall, though, very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK read but not much insight into becoming a trader.","review":"By turns humorous, vulgar, scatological and even touching, I found that I learned more about the author and his love for his wife that I did about trading.

He goes into some great personal stories about trading.

It covers many aspects of the trading life of Marty Schwartz. This includes how he moved from writing research reports, on to trading options, then to trading S&P; futures. It includes numerous useful anecdotes and trading advice, and you know that he's not a \\"snake oil salesman\\" because it's well known that he actually was/is a master trader that's made many millions. If you are interesting in the work and process that goes into trading, check out this book.Nick WroblewskiWindy City Esquire, Ltd."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true inspiration for the independent trader","review":"Marty Schwartz has always been one of my favorite Wizards from the Jack Schwager series. He has shown that it is possible for a determined individual to work hard and develop their own trading plan and be very successful at it on their own. The guy is super-aggressive and has balls of steel to beat others in this hypercompetitive world.The book does have a bit too much of superflous details about his personal life that have more to do with his ego than his trading success. And regarding his daily routine, does one really need to know about his 'plumbing' schedule? Regardless, this is a must-read not just for the entertainment value, but the brutal ups and downs that any big-shot trader faces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to Read","review":"A good way to describe this book might be to say that it is what /Reminiscence of a Stock Operator/ would have been like had Philip Roth written it.Many times while I was reading this, I had to look at the back cover and reread Ace Greenberg's quote: \\"Buzzy Schwartz is a winner....All else is nonsense.\\" Because this book is so full of insipid nonsense, you might forget Schwartz is, in fact, a winner.I suggest checking it out at the library and reading only the last two chapters, which actually have something in them that could be called \\"lessons\\". (Please note the title of this book.) Forget the rest, it's nonsense. Like many other reviewers here have said, there is no system on a silver platter. Take what you can find and do your own research.Whatever you decide, realize that no great trader would ever \\"need\\" this book, certainly not for its \\"psychological insights\\". Buzzy wouldn't have, at least."},{"rating":"1","title":"A egotist says \\"Look at me! I am great\\"","review":"The title is deceiving. The book reveals little to the reader about how to be a better trader. It's a catchy title, but the real purpose of the book was to satisfy the immature ego of this admittedly great trader.For someone who had $ as his single target, he protests and cries aligator tears when the investors in his hedge fund pulled out because they were concerned about the safety of THEIR money. \\"They abandoned me\\"... like we're supposed to have sympathy on him because an illness prevented him from achieving his fantasy of being \\"the biggest and the best\\". He compares himself with George Soros!I hated this book because I couldn't get past my revulsion of the self-aggrandizing author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lore is always exciting, but...","review":"Schwartz gives a visceral feel for his trading style and his life, and the book was exciting to read, but, if you are looking for deep insight find it elsewhere. Actually his trading style is very simple - Schwartz is a Zweig clone momentum player. He owes much of his success to a few indicators that are bound to fail one day. But his drive is overpowering, and by that time he'll have new weapons. Schwartz is not worth knowing as a person, and he talks narcissistically of himself, even offering us details of his defecation patterns. If you want a good read don't buy Pit Bull. A far superior book is Neiderhoffer's \\"The Education of a Speculator\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pit Bull Lessons from Wall Street's Champion Day Trader","review":"Not funny as some reviews state. No real inside information on trading. Certainly , no comparison to \\"Liar's Poker\\". The trade in value last week was .61 cents. This week it's .52 cents. Short this book.Harper must be a vanity publisher. And to think three people collaborated on this book.Anyone wishing to read this can find a free copy in my recycle bin this week."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth more than 5 bucks","review":"This book was mildly entertaining. His story is akin to reading an autobiography written by a drunk sailor. This guy is not much of a writer, and his story is a common one. The book is about a trader finding out who he is. He's mostly writing to himself, not you. The book is like a journal. \\"I just couldn't stop doubling up ! I...I...I was killing myself, oh no my wife wouldn't call to bail me out ! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH !!!! You must have discipline ! You need discipline !\\" hahahaha....How many times have you (if you're a trader) heard crap like that ? Same old song and dance that you read in almost any trading book...nothing profound or enlightening, and you will not learn anything. You never learn much of anything in trading until you've lived as a trader."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT - FUN READ","review":"I loved this book. The concept was excellent, the writing was clever, and I was pleased that he came to a conclusion at the end which was unexpected, made a lot of sense, and is an authentic solution to our political deadlock. Liberals (who I consider to be more thoughtful readers) will most likely agree. If someone wrote a book called Liberalize Me, I doubt if it would have the same effect on conservative readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Citations","review":"Overall, Conservatize Me was all right. I did enjoy John Moe's side of The Experiment and found it somewhat enlightening to see the what Moe portrays as the thoughts of a liberal. The humor was not always funny and many times acidic towards topics Moe strongly disagreed with (like religion). I did notice something important in regards to the integrity of the book. There are no citations. There are footnotes, but they are Moe's additional thoughts. There are mentions of media outlets and events, such as \\"The Washington Post said blah blah\\" or \\"Dick Cheney was involved in blah blah,\\" but no citations of any events, interviews, news articles, or anything. None. So in regards to being considered a valid source, Conservatize Me is not a valid source for anything. I recommend keeping that in mind when reading this book and before accepting anything in the book as truth.Due to the validity of the book I took a star off my rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, if not overly deep","review":"If you are considering this book, you have to think of it as fluff. The book is full of amusing anecdotes and interesting conversations. While I was reading it, I thought maybe I should try to lighten up about conservatives. Of course, the very next book I real was \\"Imperial Life in the Emerald City\\" and I went right back to hating the conversative movement. I guess my feeling of detente with conservatives crashed hard into the reality of conservative's actual policies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"People are always condemning the Dalyites for their \\"separatism,\\" but my feeling is that they couldn't be separate enough.

Oscie Mason is a headstrong young girl growing up around the time of the American Civil War. She lives in Manassas, Virginia. Her father has died and her mother is remarrying. Her new stepfather, Will McLean, and Oscie are constantly at battle. With the tension growing between the South and the North, this novel brings in a historical aspect to an exciting and gripping story. The characters are developed well, so the reader is drawn into the plot. I felt like I could relate with the characters. There are also personal conflicts as the characters struggle with themselves, what is right, and romance. A slave named Mary Ann causes many problems in the household, and Oscie is determined to get rid of her any way possible. With the oncoming war, Will McLean wants to move his family away from danger.

This boy, Cusi, knows little of his past, and has no home other than the mountains, no family outside his elderly mentor and his llamas.Time passes and Cusi knows he must leave the mountain, leave his llamas, leave his mentor, and go to the city to seek out his heart's desire.

And, if he does, will it be what he thought it would be?A wonderful little story of the seeking and finding of simple happiness in a big world."},{"rating":"1","title":"award????","review":"My daughter had to read this.

We also read more things about Incas which helped us to understand things like \\"quipu\\" which is a number of different colored and tied cords that Incans used to record events as they did not write.

Sadly, this rehashed Black Cherry makes a poor follow up to the smooth beauty and erie grace of FM. It probably deserves better than 1 star, but I feel obliged to bring the average rating down as 4 1/2 stars is WAY too much for what this album has to offer.

It may just be the import version - US domestics may not have the same handicap.Buy it on vinyl or buy it in the store so you can verify whether the version you have is crippled.I'd give the vinyl and non-copy-protected releases 4 stars for the music.

You do NOT have to have both on your computer.I played this set consecutively over the course of a couple of months this summer -- long after the Myst popularity faded. The Myst version in the set holds up really well, compared to other games from that period. The art is still stunning and the game remains intriguing despite the relative simplicity of program.Of course, Riven cranks the gameplay up a couple of notches with more video elements and some of the puzzles seem nearly impossible at times.

I do not use the trimmer often but when I do, it gets a tough workout. The trimmer itself is great but the on/off switch is far too light for a tough job. I estimate I get about 20 hours on a switch before it burns out. After two burnouts, I plan to install a 15 amp 125VAC toggle switch which I will probably have to jury rig.

This prevented one of the contacts from bridging the connection then the button was pressed.

I have never read an Evanovich book I didn't like until now. I literally finished the book only because Janet wrote it.The book pretty much goes like this: steal a hauler, Beans is kidnapped, follow people around, get Beans back, follow more people around, Gobbles is kidnapped, follow some more people around, Hooker is kidnapped(my favorite part, who likes a cheater!), follow even more people around, etc, etc... Wish I had a nickel for every car they tailed in this book. I also agree with the other reviewers, Beans the dog got on my nerves pretty quick.I'm still a huge fan of the Stephanie Plum series. I can't wait for the next Plum book in January. I just wish Janet would have spent her time working on the next Plum novel instead of wasting everyones time with Motor Mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I like all the Stephanie Plum books (although the Stephanie, Joe Morelli, Ranger triangle is really getting old).

Hopefully JE can still be creative and is not getting stagnant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and entertaining, a great light read","review":"Motormouth caught my attention in audio books. I enjoyed the characters and the acting done by C.J. Critt. I am new to Janet Evanovich novels and had no preconceived notions of \\"Stephanie\\". The main character, Barney, intrigued me, as did Sam Hooker. There is definite chemistry between them and the story moves alone at a healthy, but not too rushed pace. I listen to books while driving on a long commute, and am happy to hear that Barney and Hooker have established a following. I will be one of those waiting for the next installment! When I have to take an audio book inside the house to finish it, I consider it a good read, as I did Motormouth. I will be sure to check out other novels by Janet E."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Narration, Great Story","review":"I bought this book on audio and Full Scoop on audio at the same time. Unlike the latest Full book, this book is a great example of why I buy Janet's books rather than go to the library for them. I will keep this audio book in my own library to enjoy over and over again. CJ Critt does a fantastic job with the voices, I laughed so hard when I heard her do Nascar Guy, Hooker. The story is original (if a little far fetched) and fun to listen to.

She's great! I keep seeing the story as a movie. It would be great if cast & directed right. It's kinda like Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels. A hoot, I totally give it 5 stars.

Keeps the suspense needed for a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evanovich Does it Again!","review":"Even with a new heroine Janet Evanovich has proved that she hasn't lostany of her talent when it comes to writing. Evanovich has a gift when itcomes to discribing the characters in her stories, making them almostlife-like. I have no trouble visualizing the characters she writesabout. Her books are some of the few and I read alot, that make me laughout loud at either the characters or the situations that they find themselves in. I really enjoy all of her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Follow-Up","review":"I know it is hard not to compare this book with a Plum novel, but you just can't. The characters are different (except for maybe the dog), with different personalities, and different adventures. This one focuses on NASCAR and driving and solving a murder in the middle of all of that. But, the characters are still compelling people. Barney is strong willed woman and I loved reading about her shooting Hooker's sexual advances down over and over again. It just made me laugh.I enjoyed this book and found it to be a quick read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tried another","review":"Could wrap myself around this one either.

When her rereleased novels started to appear, her romance and 'full' series with charlottle i basically came to the conclusion that for me her writing skills just improve every year and that is why i didn't like any of her pre-plum novels, and so when metro girl came out i ate it up like a good obedient fan and loved it.... Sad to say motor mouth, was just one dissapointment after another. And i actually recommend to everyone not to read it and be dissapointed. but then again, i am a die hard ranger fan and once evanovich finally chooses morelli, i will stop reading the plum novels. so it's everyone to themselves but i personally hated the book. an they're, how shall i say, not so good!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it!","review":"Not sure why this book isn't getting more rave reviews...

I'll be reading any of her books and the next thing I know, I'll be laughing out loud!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor Mouth","review":"This was a fast read, but a rather outlandish plot line. The more the story progressed the more unrealistic it became. Might be a decent beach book if you are looking for something light."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing to an Evanovich fan","review":"I'm a big fan of Janet Evanovich and the Plum novels. I also usually enjoy C.J. Critt as a reader, but this one failed to capture my attention. Critt's reading made Sam Hooker more lecherous creep than sexy, though flawed, hero.I'm intrigued by the NASCAR concept and love that Barney is an engineer, but the formula isn't working. It seems like Evanovich did more research for Stephanie Plum's bounty hunter than she has on women in NASCAR, so it's harder to get into these books. There are also too many location changes, unlike the Plum novels, where Trenton, NJ almost becomes a character itself.As a fan, I know Janet Evanovich can do much better than this. The family business needs to drop this product line and stick with what they know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to read, light-hearted romp or Life with Beans","review":"If you enjoy reading the Plum series, you will find this book light and fun to read. The dialogue is not quite as snappy nor are the characters as colorful, but you can get carried away on the flow of the words and the changes of scenery. I could picture South Beach, the yacht, the luxury hotels and the concierge of \\"The Pearl.\\" I loved Beans and Itzy-Poo. Actions involving the exploits of Beans are laugh-out-loud entertainment. Sure it isn't Stephanie Plum and LuLu and don't read it expecting it to be so. This is a diversion for Evanovich and I'm sure she enjoyed writing it as much as I enjoyed reading it. Spend a few quiet hours in your recliner with a Lite beer or iced tea and chill!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I don't know who wrote this book, but they should refrain from insulting us again. I really had to struggle to get through this book. I love the Plum series; I've read them all several times over, but I could barely get through this dreck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I too am a big Janet fan.I was hoping, as the second book into this series, that it would develop more of a personality of its own. I find Barney to be a poorly written first draft of Stephanie. I tried very hard during both books not to compare the two (I can with other authors) - but there are too many similarities to Stephanie. Even when Barney meets Simon, she tells him shes a lingerie buyer, Come on!!!I will continue to support Janet w/ the Plum Series, but this one I give up on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho-Hum","review":"I'm a big Evanovich fan, or, I should say, a Stephanie Plum fan. However, the Barnaby/Hooker series is downright disappointing. After reading both books in the series, I still don't feel as if I know the main characters and at this point I'm not sure if I want to. I'm assuming Ms. Evanovich put Alex and Sam in the off-again\\" part of their relationship at the beginning of the book in order to create sexual tension throughout the book. Unfortunately, it still wasn't enough to make me want to continue reading. I almost quit several times. However, NASCAR information was interesting even though I'm not a fan. I didn't care for the disrespectful manner in which dead bodies were treated. It was obviously supposed to be silly and slapstick, but I found it distasteful. Didn't have any LOL moments while reading this book, but I guess the really good jokes have to be set aside for Stephanie and the gang. Still a JE fan, but won't be reading any more of this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forced my way through it","review":"I love many of Evanovich's books, but this one just wasn't very good. I love her dialogue, and the silly pranks throughout her stories, and this one had plenty of those. But the characters just aren't that interesting. And I agree that the NASCAR information was just over the top. A bit interesting if you're a fan, I'm sure, but I'm not. And, the characters are overly familiar as rewrites of characters from her other books. I'm sorry I bought this in hardcover -- I paid too much!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a car wreck","review":"I love Janet Evanovich, so I was excited to read another of her books. But it was a disappointment. With the second book of the series I still have no sense of who Barney and Hooker are. Secondary characters ... Felicia and Rosa are more fleshed out. I simply didn't care if Barney and Hooker succeeded in their mission.Rather than NASCAR being a backdrop to the story, the book feels more like a NASCAR documentary with a fiction story behind it. Too much information about the inner workings of NASCAR racing felt forced and not really part of the story.I actually enjoyed Janet's released novels \\"Back to the Bedroom\\" and \\"Man Hunt\\" more.I agree with reviewer, Cherise, the first book in the series seemed rushed and this one does too. I'm not ready to give up on the series, but I hope book three focuses more on character than NASCAR fun facts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, no!","review":"Thank God I didn't actually buy this one. Characters were variations of the \\"Plum\\" series, and not as funny either. While Stephanie Plum's antics are hardly credible- ie, getting her cars blown up every other day- at least her characters are loveable and funny, and are enjoyable to read. This one didn't have much going for it, so I gave it back after a couple of chapters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to like Barney","review":"The main appeal of Stephanie Plum is that she's an average woman, dealing with an average family and some not so average circumstances. Alexandra Barnaby is freaking wonder woman with bad judgment. The secondary characters seem to be two dimensional copies of the Plum characters, but with less interesting personalities.Trying to like these first person POV told stories when you hate the main voice is near impossible. This was the last Barney book I'm going to bother with, I'd rather reread Plum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"I'm getting tired of how formulaic Evanovich is getting. I really enjoy the Stephanie Plum series, but now in her Barney books we've got to have coy sex (seen it already), a big slobbery dog (yup, seen that too), and lots of come-here come-here, go-away go-away. It makes me sad because I really like Janet Evanovich's books and I'd hate to see them get to be all the same. There was a time when I liked Danielle Steele, but got so I couldn't stand the book after book cookie cutter heroine (5'1 or 5'2, blonde or red hair, blue or green eyes, beautiful with Daddy issues)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Even in the Race","review":"As others have mentioned, this book pales in comparison to the more fleshed-out Plum series. I love the Plum series and I laugh out loud reading those novels. I didn't laugh once in this book, a couple of wry smiles was the best I could muster. Some of the reasons are: Barney is no Stephanie; and Hooker is no Morelli and definitely NO Ranger! He is portrayed as a real horn-dog with very little redeeming qualities other than being an animal lover, i.e. Beans the dog. Barney even beats up some guys for him, he's a loser. I would be happy if Janet continued to pour all her efforts into the Plum series and let this one dwindle off. I am not too much of a fan of the \\"Tilt\\" series either, boring!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Evanovich Hit","review":"Although I am still not as \\"into\\" the Barnaby series as the Plum, I must admit, this one was pretty darn funny! Her books hold your interest, and they are really quick reads. I can't wait to read \\"Plum Lovin\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great book by Evanovich!","review":"I LOVED Motor Mouth! It was such a fun read and I greatly enjoyed the characters. Being a NASCAR fan, I love the theme of these books even more. I greatly enjoyed Metro Girl, but have to say that I loved this one even more! I can't wait for the next Evanovich to come out!! I look forward to each of her releases and have yet to be disappointed! I highly recommend this one for a fun read full of laughs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What!","review":"I ended up just skimming the rest of the book after getting half way through. I read Evanovich way back before Stephanie and have owned all of her books written solely by her. I suppose this book could be savored IF you are a NASCAR fan, which I am not. Most of the attention and detail went into that. I didn't laugh until after page 200 and I think it was a laugh of desperation. Much of the gags fell flat for me, they seemed too cartoonish. I like silly but too much was just dumb. Dog poop plays a major part in one. The violence in it bothered me too and it doesn't that much in the Plum books. I'm not sure why here, maybe because there's a reason in the Plum books - she's a bounty hunter. It just seemed to contain just a lot of surface writing with the two main charaters, and only got interesting when the minor characters showed up - the non grieving widow and the two friends from Florida. Finally some non-NASCAR color."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why, why why?","review":"I usually depend on Janet Evanovich for quick, funny and involving mysteries, but I'll never read another Alex Barnaby again. So much is a rehash of what works with Stephanie Plum; coy off-and-on romance, check; sassy ethnic ladies, check; sloppy dogs, check.This one made no sense. Why didn't Alex and Nascar guy call the police right away when a friend disappeared? How could they be in hiding while involving people with huge families in their problems and being asked for autographs?It was also disgusting. Who wants to read about a dog with bowel issues, nasty corpses and a dog with bowel issues having run-ins with nasty corpses? Most disturbingly, none of the gore bothered the main characters. It was like a PG-rated 'Natural Born Killers.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"It crashes on lap 2","review":"I'm a fan of Janet Evanovich and her Stephanie Plum series, I think it's laugh out loud funny. I didn't care for this story at all, it seemed sloppily constructed and I agree with other reviewers, lacked a story line or believable characters. I left off a few chapters into it, there was no point in finishing."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"after anticipating this book to be published. I rushed to the store as soon as it was out I bought it. It doesn't come near as interesting, funny, up to the usual standards of Janet's writing. It left me flat you ask yourself what happened to the interesting quick thinking brassy talking characters from metro girl? I would not reccomend this book. When I read Janet's books I usually laugh out loud. Nothing to laugh in this book all old dialogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor narrator on the recorded book","review":"I liked the first book in this series but was unable to listen to more than a few minutes of the recorded version of Motor Mouth. The narrator was horrible, using a bizarre accent that would have been out of place in a cartoon for Hooker, and a bland cleaned-up standard accent for the New Jerseyite heroine."},{"rating":"1","title":"How do you spell drivel?","review":"I am a diehard Stephanie Plum fan, and Janet Evanovich is a fantastic writer. Where, oh where do these airhead simplistic lightweight books come from and why? Such a waste of her talent! I don't know, maybe she is writing for a different audience, but I know there are Stephanie fans just like me, buying these other books of hers, just in case, like I do. My copy of this one is going on Ebay, where the last Barnaby dud went. I hope I get a buck for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak and disappointing..","review":"I never miss an Evanovich book. She is the only author I actually buy in harcover. I want my money back !!! This is a pale shadow of her usual writing. Maybe her publisher was pressuring her for a book so she tossed this one off. I don't know but I do know I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Janet Evanowich has done it again.","review":"I am a huge fan of Janet Evanowich and her Stefanie Plum novels. I was concerned that her Metro Girl & Motor Mouth series would not live up to my expectations. I was wrong! Alex Barnaby is a fun character and her story line is a typical Evanowich - crazy with turns and twists. Just like Bob in the Stephanie Plum novels, we get to meet Beans the hairy beast. This is a quick read and very light hearted. I bought this series for my sister at Christmas, and I'm sure she'll love it. Happy Reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Miami madness for the second time","review":"This is the second book in the Barnaby series. While I was greatly disappointed in the first book in the series, as I had been given the second book as well, I decided to go ahead and read it to see if the series improved. Taking place primarily in Miami, it involves a secret race car controller that can improve performance, a dead body wrapped in plastic, and a St. Bernard along with the main characters from the first book, Barnaby, an engineering graduate/gearhead who now works for NASCAR racer Hooker and is his on again/off again girlfriend, and Hooker himself. As in the first book, the plot and character actions not only strain, but completely burst any sense of credulity as the events cascade into kidnappings, hit men, and more murders. After this one, I will not go forward with this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would pass","review":"I don't usually write a review on a book I didn't finish but something was missing in Janet's latest book. It went back to the Library today - thank goodness I didn't spend money on it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor Mouth out of Gas","review":"I was so excited to get this book. Now let's face it these books arent The Kite Runner, but they are a fun fare for a plane or a beach--perfect for my recent trip to Hawaii. Halfway through the book I decided the easy Sudoku's were much more fun and amusing than this cast of characters. I rarely do not finish a book, especially an Evanovich--but when you could care less about the heroine, hero, dog, plot, story---well, time to motor into the sunset."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment","review":"I really wish I had read the book flap before buying this book. Had I read that it had anything to do with NASCAR, I would have put it down and spent my $25+ on another book....my mistake. The ONLY reason I actually read the whole book is because I did pay $25+ for it and just felt like I should. It was not entertaining and just dragged on and on. So, not only was it dull and slow, it was about NASCAR...a sport and subject that is just not my cup of tea. I love the Stephanie Plum series and will continue to purchase Evanovich books in that series, but will not buy anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Once a cheater...","review":"If you're like me and are completely repelled by men who cheat - pass this one by. In this book JE committed the ultimate taboo (in my romance reading opinion) and had Hooker cheat on Barney with another woman. Once I came to the first reference to his affair with someone else (in the first chapter) I could barely stand to finish the book (I skimmed). I liked Barney in the first book and tolerated Hooker but in this second book of the new series I couldn't get into it at all because I couldn't connect with Hooker's character at all. Buyer beware on this one - Evanovich missed the mark."},{"rating":"2","title":"This girl has a great imagination. Loved it","review":"Would read it again just to laugh at her antics.

One is terrific and one is the worst telephone system I have ever owned. The terrific system is model E5655, purchased from Hammacher Schlemmer, and the dreadful system is model E5965C, which is the model sold here on Amazon.The model sold by Hammacher Schlemmer is about half the size and bulk of the model sold here. As others have written, the model sold here, even a well-charged phone, repeatedly goes dead in the middle of conversations. I own both the system and the accessory phone, and both are dreadful. In the Hammacher Schlmmer version, the phone is perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many disappointments","review":"Others have written about this phone not holding the charge, and I agree! I can't tell you how many times a call has gone dead in the middle of a conversation, with no warning, no low battery message. I've only had the phone since November. There is not a quick, convenient way to redail numbers--you have to choose from a list of options, 1-plus number, or the area code without the 1, or no 1 and no area code. No easy way to speed dial. Range is disappointing. I'm looking for a new phone. Back to Uniden or Panasonic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware... it's another dual-band device","review":"This one looked so good, so I went to Circuit City yesterday to take a look. Right on the box, it brags about using 5.8 GHz AND 2.4 GHz to provide the best performance. Seems that all the so-called 5.8 GHz devices built by V-tech, including those V-tech builds for other companies like AT&T, are dual band. Beware, if you are worried about interference to your computer wireless network."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run of the mill light suspense","review":"This is very very light reading. There isn't much but fluff here. The love angle was thankfully downplayed because it wasn't very believable anyway. There wasn't enough time for the characters to form any kind of relationship. In general, the story just seems dated (it is the early 70's I suppose)... I can hardly believe that some intrepid police inspector failed to notice key evidence that night putting the true murderess behind bars. Or surely forensic science would have solved the case preventing the mother from going to a mental institution.Readers would be better off reading something with a little more backbone... Agatha Christie or P.D. James."},{"rating":"1","title":"Improper shipping and/or bad product","review":"I recently ordered a box of these nails along with a nail gun and hose. Big mistake. Almost every coil was crushed, many broken.

Also, it looks as if the seams on the pillow case are pulling apart and to make it more obvious, they used white thread on black material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, Polished Prog Metal Debut","review":"Degree Absolute's debut album certainly sounds like this band has been around for years. From the concise, tight and progressive riffing to the warm clean vocal style and near-flawless production, this album is top-notch for any fan of the progressive metal style.Degree Absolute lay down serious, philosophic progressive metal heavy on both atmospherics and complexity, with a very modern, polished feel and some great musicianship on display. Vocals reminiscent of the classic prog metal band Fate's Warning (which is never a bad thing), tight, intricate and heavy riffing in the vein of Zero Hour, and sublime, ambient-inspired soundscapes and mournful melodies reminiscent of Porcupine Tree. Addictive and cerebral thinking man's metal. I would like to hear a follow up....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Mature Yet","review":"After several attempts to really get into this progressive band, I have ultimately given up. Not a whole lot of melody in the songs, and the singer seems rather strained to make it all come together. If you're a fan of bands like Dream Theater or Kamelot, then look elsewhere. Thought Chamber and Atmosfear are more polished for newer bands, and I'd recommend them over this group. At the end of the day, I didn't encode a single track from the CD onto my computer. That's a first for me.On another note, the CD (when it arrived from Amazon) looked cheaply produced with poor printing quality on the label, and the whole feel of this album ultimately felt amateurish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snooze...","review":"Snooze.

I love stories that take place in Europe with vivid descriptions and lively characters and funny anecdotes. This book promised all this and more. Unfortunately, it didn't deliver. Instead, it is a stilted recounting of somebody's road trip. It could take place anywhere in the world or nowhere at all. The descriptions of towns and countrysides are two dimensional and boring, characters are stiff and shallow, and supposedly funny anecdotes are stilted and forced. The whole thing comes off like reading a really dry travel book. So, if you want vivid, colorful descriptions of lovely French towns and hilarious tales of travel gone awry, try a Rick Steves' travel book. If you want a passionate romantic tale, try any number of romance writers. But whatever you do, don't waste your money on this one. Thank goodness I checked my copy out at the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Last Time Adler Saw Paris","review":"Adler has such marvelous talent, but I found this book a travelogue with sex and no development of plot. I have read her earlier books and wonder how she has drifted so far off course. This is a work beneath her abilities and I'll be wary of even picking up her next attempt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooooooooring...","review":"The first 100 pages were ok, but then when they are in France, the book becomes so boring: \\"...and then they drove through this town, and it was so beautiful, and then they stayed at this inn, and it was so beautiful, and then they drove through that town, and it was so beautiful, and then they ate here, and it was wonderful\\" etc. etc. etc. Not worth wasting your time on. Also, too much was written in French, and it was very predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"When are we going to have strong women characters","review":"This was the same romantic dribble. Woman marries man when young, man cheats on woman when older, older woman finds solace in arms of younger man.Why do women need another man to get over the first man?Save your money and buy a tour guide book like Lonely Planet Paris if you want to read about Paris. And if you want romance where a great women meets a great man, read Jennifer Cruise"},{"rating":"1","title":"Drivel","review":"This book was so cliche-ridden and trite that it isn't worth the paper it's printed on. The characters are predictable, the plot tedious, and the book entirely forgettable. Don't waste your time or your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Elizabeth Adler novel","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. The descriptions oftravel were my favorite part of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and trite.","review":"Like so many other books -- middle aged wife dumped by husband for a younger woman. She comes out on top and with a younger man to boot. Redundant as well, wife fights with new lover, they make up. And again. And again. At least they ate well..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read a travel guide or read a bodice-ripper, but not this!","review":"While it was an easy read, as most romances are, I found the plot and the events happening therein extremely trite and redundant. A middle-aged woman escapes to Paris with a younger man after finding out her husband has been cheating on her (promising enough) but what ensues are repetitive descriptions of charming French inns, exotic food (if she mentions getting a \\"grand crème\\" one more time, I will scream!), and tepid, sentimental erotic encounters. Each chapter plays like the one before it: Lara loves the scenery, Lara loves Dan, Lara experiences self-doubt, Lara and Dan quibble, Lara goes shopping, Lara and Dan make love, Lara feels better. Ugh. Maybe a 7th grader would consider this marginally interesting, but I consider it something that would tire even the most bored, romantically-deprived reader. Check it out at your local library (at your own risk)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I hung this bird feeder this morning, and within ten minutes, I saw my first Oriole of the season! I am very happy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pictorial of TV's Golden Age","review":"This volume deals with TV in its infancy throughout the 50's. If you are looking for in depth articles on TVshows from the 60's and 70's look elsewhere. However if you are a baby boomer who remembers Miss Frances and her Ding Dong School this book is for you. Great pictorial and narrative of early TV, variety shows, dramas, soap operas, musicals, its all here. This is a splendidly well done (and long out of print) volume chronicling early TV with many photos of shows and people you will remember. Very interesting and informative. A great return to yesterday and a simpler more innocent time."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best 60's biker film soundtracks","review":"Been searching for the elusive The Wild Angels music for years. I have both volumes on vinyl, but am happy to have finally found some of the songs on this disc. Would love to see both soundtrack volumes released as well!! C'mon Mr Allen!! Strike us with the arrows."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD defines the late 1960's","review":"The song \\"Blues Theme\\" was the first 45 I ever wore out the grooves on - at age 6! This song was responsible for programming my musical tapes from day one: the raw guitar licks, the sounds of a starting chopper, the manic beat. The rest of the CD can't quite compare to Blues Theme, but it still holds up today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wild Angels CD","review":"This CD was much better than I expected. I thought that it would only be the music sound track from the movie \\"Wild Angels\\" but it was better than that. It had two pieces from the \\"Wild Angels\\", one from the \\"Devils Angels\\", the James Bond theme, the Peter Gun theme, Star Trek theme, among others. I didn't realize that this group, the \\"Arrows\\", was involved with so many movie music sound tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, this is great!","review":"I have been searching for Davie Allan material for a long time. I'm glad I got to download some excerpts. It only makes me want to get the \\"real thing.\\" The stuff sounds as good today as when I had it on a record (Remember those?) Can someone help me? Does Davie still perform with the Arrows? If so, I would really like to see him live. Is Davie in a chat room? What a \\"trip\\" it would be to talk to this legend in person!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE!! ____EXTREME DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"I should have paid attention to the other comments regarding delivery of this item. I ordered this item on 12/6/07 as a gift for some very special out of area friends. I was just informed today 12/18/07 that this item will not be shipped until after 1/7/07!! What took them so long to figure this out I do not comprehend. Also, I paid for part of it with an Amazon 'earned coupon' which I disgarded after I used it so don't know how I would ever get that back. As a result I will just have to wait until the holidays are over for these folks to receive their gift. What a HUGE disappointment!!So --- can't even comment on the product or quality as I have no idea when it will finally arrive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to get.","review":"I attempted to order this as a Christmas Gift for a friend starting in November 2006. Over the next three months my order was delayed with no good reason given. Promised ship dates were extended by weeks. Finally in February I was told that the order would never be processed. I was never so embarrassed and would never use this provider for any future orders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the watch","review":"I enjoyed watching this movie for a couple of reasons. The beautiful scenery of the golf courses, the complicated story of love between fathers and sons,and the concept of following a dream despite all the obstacles along the way. The story isn't so much about golf as it's about a man discovering the secret to happiness. It's his journey to following his dream that brings him the lessons he needs. Fitzgerald gave us a slice of his life, but hope he offers us more. I feel as if he's a good friend now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not helpful","review":"No talent ass-clown, delusions of grandeur. This guys swing was not only ugly but appeared to have zero improvement throughout the film. I felt awkward every time I watched him swing, even more so every time he opened his mouth. The real golf pros seemed overly judgmental in their opinions which seemed odd to me, they just had to of seen him swing before making those comments, that whole part was kinda unfair to them.If you plan to watch for a glimmer of what it might be like to go pro, don't bother. This documentary has zero value and I'd hate to think anyone comes away from it thinking that a single bit of it reflects the true life of someone with half a chance. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's Cinderella?","review":"Incredibly boring (the film too), Jon Fitzgerald fails to inspire. He generates little interest and, consequently, support in his quest to become a professional golfer. His is a story deliriously absent of adversity, intrigue and triumph. The film ends where it begins; a better than average golfer living a privileged but average life."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible movie","review":"This is the most boring, self-center, nonsense movie about a wimpy, self-absorbed, spoiled person.Where is the golf? Grow-up Fitzgerald!!!! This guy has major personal issues. All is does it talk about his personal problems. This is 100% self promotional. There is very little golf covered in the movie.DO NOT WASTE YOU MONEY OR TIME WATCHING THIS MOVIE!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This guy should have quit after the first nine...","review":"Horrible waste of time. I absolutely loathed this guy by the end and so did everyone else I watched it with. Self-centered mooch spends a few years selfishly \\"improving\\" his game and enjoying coaches, trainers, experiences all paid for by anyone associated with the movie. He bemoans his relationships with his two dads but bolts to Scotland when his wife is due with their son to seek more enlightenment. Grow up dude. The preview was very misleading and this guy had no chance of ever making it on the tour. Wish I had that grueling hour and 45 minutes back. What a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh the horror...","review":"This move is for YOU...If you love movies about 40 year old guys talking advantage of serious instructors i(im guessing in exchange for free pub) in a half assed attempt to make some amateur golf tour that nbody knows exists.In his first ever tourney the guy wins...shooting an 84? Iit goes downhill from thereProduction is pretty solid and earned that second star though.So, It seems the director has loaded the amazon reviews with shills. Anybody giving this sucker 5 stars is either a friend or stoned, very stoned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away!!","review":"This movie/documentary was brutal. They should show it on a loop in a interrogation room until the guy breaks.....I couldn't get over this guy's crappy swing and delusions of grandeur. Dude, please!! After seeing you swing one time, I knew there was no way you would make it. And to top it all off, your personality was worse than your swing. What I wouldn't give to have that hour and 45 minutes back in my life. Stay away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Your Priorities Straight","review":"Just horrendous. This guy does not have his priorities in line. It is certainly tough to sit through the whole documentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"can't root for this guy","review":"Fitzgerald just seemed really selfish and deluded to me. I could not root for him. He talks about his childhood and his two fathers, etc., etc., yet he goes off to go on a golf tour in Europe leaving his pregnant wife and daughter at home. Robert Redford's comments about Fitzgerald starting his own film festival is very telling... the guy can't deal with rejection."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mixture of History and Legend","review":"\\"When London Walked In Terror\\" is very interesting and entertaining -- but it is much like a teledrama in its departure from history, and its presentation of some legends and rumors as fact. \\"The Complete Jack The Ripper\\" by Donald Rumbelow debunks several items reported by Cullen (even mentioning Cullen by name at one point, seemingly irked that Cullen bought some of the second-hand material \\"When London Walked in Terror\\" presented as fact).This book makes for a good story, but it's not a good history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad quality","review":"It says it can be used on thin sheet metal but it can't. I cut through very thin sheet and it destroyed the blade before it made it through one hole."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adequate for light-medium duty","review":"This is a perfectly adequate hole saw set if you aren't too demanding.The saw blades are not sharp enough for very hard materials. I have only used it in a white oak stripling trunk so far, and it was slow going. Also, the pilot drill bit isn't top quality, either. Be sure to drill a smaller pilot hole to the necessary depth.Assembling the saw is a little tricky, too. The set screw for the drill must be turned down with the drill bit out before you can put the saw blade on, then raised with the drill in place before the screw-down collar is put on. Not a rush job kind of thing.If you don't need to use it often its works well enough, and its a very good value. I would also suggest taping some padding (like a piece of bubble wrap padded envelope) inside the case lid to keep the nested saw blades from banging around. Or else you will sound like you're smuggling wind chimes."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},W=["disabled"],O={key:0},N={key:1};function R(o,e,n,u,s,r){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",C,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(r.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:s.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[s.isLoading?(a(),i("span",N,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",O,"See more"))],8,W)):b("",!0)])}const B=d(x,[["render",R],["__scopeId","data-v-373c9230"]]),P=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/6.md","filePath":"guide/6.md"}'),H={name:"guide/6.md"},L=Object.assign(H,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(B)]))}});export{P as __pageData,L as default};
