I think not. The only thing I've used in the kit was the scissors (which was the only thing really useable). The needles were small and fragile and you get very little thread. The needle threaders don't even work. It's like a thin wire has been elmer-glued to some aluminum foil. Anything that requires a little yank will make it fall apart.

This book should be taught starting in junior high. It's clearly and simply written and very few of the concepts require a great deal of thought. After understanding it, you'll trust your own judgement over the babblers on tv and in the universities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better than \\"Economics In One Lesson\\"","review":"I think this is the best book out there to help quickly spread a basic understanding of economics and therefore how the world works. The knowledge and importance per page ratio is the highest I have ever read. Even better than Harry Browne's intro to economics from his famous first 80 pages of \\"How you can profit from the coming devaluation\\" .Pages 13 - 90 are the heart of the book. That is 77 pages that in less than 2 hours can take your average person from unfortunate ignorance to economic genius compared to your average economics college graduate.Somehow someone needs to reach Bill Gates and Warren Buffet and get them to read this book and put a copy in every american household.

The author speaks domgatically about economic matters when there is a lot of room for debate. Some of what he claims to be true seems silly. For example, that every dollar taxed is a dollar not used by private enterprise to create good jobs. Based on his numbers there would be no good jobs in America!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If it was strictly about the Wives it would have given it 5 stars","review":"The show is filmed like your typical reality show.

Crumb's most infamous work. His dark vision of sexual relations (which crosses, at times, the border of misogyny), is at its most extreme in this volume. Angered by feminist attacks on his work, the intent of these stories and drawings seems to be to bait his critics, embodying every object of their scorn. What shines through on every page is Crumb's fundemental honesty, and his brillance at depicting these raw emotions and frustrations.Not for all tastes, to be sure, but essential for an understanding of Crumb's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brush head too big, bristles too hard","review":"As another reviewer explained, the head on the brush is too large to fit comfortably in your mouth and the bristles are way too hard. I could not even finish brushing my teeth when I tried to use it because it was so uncomfortable. Plus it comes in a plastic container (not marked as recyclable) which is not helpful if you are buying this product to reduce your plastic consumption. I would instead recommend the Brooks Pearwood Boar Bristle, a very similar product in the same price range that has a smaller head and much softer bristles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great brush for plaque","review":"I really found this to be a good brush for what I was looking for, a naturally made toothbrush with strong bristles to combat build up of plaque.However, I would not recommend this for people with small mouths as the brush is quite large and even at 6'0 I find it quite big for my size."},{"rating":"1","title":"why do they even MAKE toothbrushes this STIFF??","review":"Not impressed with the stiffness of the bristles, it literally feels like I am brushing my teeth with a wire brush meant for cleaning a BBQ.

Probably(?) they say somewhere in the description that there's only 1 toothbrush for the price, but I didn't see it. And yeah, I can definitely say the price is fair, for a nice wooden toothbrush; it's just not what I thought I was buying. The picture is totally misleading.Also, the bristles are SUPER hard!

I still listen to it quite frequently and recommend it highly. This music is rich and is not like much of the \\"new age\\" music that is so easy to \\"get\\" and catchy. This is more of a jazz album in my opinion. Stunning and deeply rewarding!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Timeless Masterpiece.","review":"A very important, but long forgotten album. I have kept this album close to my heart for over 20 years now. It's a seminal album of abstract piano works. It came out in 1985, a time of chances and experimentation. Consider how it was produced in New York City and consider what was going on then in music. \\"New Age\\" and \\"Electronic Music\\" had yet to come into existence, yet we have this album of solo piano works by seminal, pioneering electronic musicians: Ryuichi Sakamoto, Eddie Jobson among others. Consider that, Piano One was released by Private Music, which was helmed by Peter Baumann of Tangerine Dream. This album defies catagorization. When I play it for people, they flip and cannot believe it is over 20 years old. It is timeless. If you find a copy, you will pay dearly for it, but it is a keeper for sure. A godsend."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best piano albums ever","review":"I own perhaps 500 piano albums from a wide variety of genres. I would place this one near the top. As others have said, this music defies description. It is somewhat jazzy, but mostly it is deeply introspective and nothing in it is superficial. This album should be reissued. I wish someone like Naxos would do that. The piano sound is very good. If you like Brad Mehldau, this album is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"I really didn't expect such a great CD. This is truly a hidden gem and I can't stop playing it. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding short piano pieces","review":"Prior to hearing this outstanding collection I had less than no interest in solo piano works - they either seemed like dreary practice pieces or chops demos that featured more technique than music.

Now, you don't hear it anymore. Bob Wills is the King of Western Swing. There is no other and there will probably never be another quite like him. Buy this CD, save it, put it somewhere safe.

I wouldn't say any of the plastic pieces are of \\"junk\\" quality, but I can definitely see how if you aren't gentle with it the drive could disconnect after assembly or you could maybe crack the plastic endcaps.

This is by far not the most rugged enclosure I have seen, but I just wanted a quick and cheap way to get my stuff. I like the fact that I do not need an external power supply, but it does come with a Y type usb cable so you can plug it into two usb ports if you need the extra power.

The side screws could have been worked a little better, this is a 1st indication that it is cheaply made.I noticed on the picture that it came in a box, mine came in a bag?

I tried this on both a Win 7 Pro 64 bit and Vista Home Premium 32 bit machine. Neither would install the drivers, so this device never showed up under My Computer. Therefore, it's worthless as you can't access anything on your hard drive. There is no manufacturer listed on the package, and since no name is given the drive under device manager, you can't even go search for a driver anywhere.

It may not. The problem with this enclosure and the reason why it sells so cheap is that it does not come with a seperate 5V power supply. Does not even have a jack for it. If you connect say a 160G Drive that requires more current than is available from a USB connection, it will not work and there is no work around, such as bringing additional power. If you connect a small drive that does not require much current and your computer can provide enough power you lucked out. It may or may not work. Nice product huh?

Saw this enclousure kit on amazon.com. For the price, I couldn't loose. Got it in quick. After connecting the hard drive, all ya had to do is slide it in the enclosure and take two screws along with a Phillips head screw driver (which both was included with the kit!) and it was done. Plug it up using one of the USB cables. It has two just in case the computer can not produce the 5v it requires to power the Had drive. (Which is mostly older machines).

Finally broke around 7 months, hard drive would turn on but not be recognized in any computer I tried it in (included ones that it worked in the day before). I got a silver one for a couple bucks so I guess you get what you pay for, but you are better off just buying a better one. Also the USB Type A as the connector for the hard drive is pretty stupid.

The drive connected to the interface and was detected in both Windows and Linux with no issues. I was able to recover the data I needed. The enclosure itself is very low quality. The drive connected to the interface with no issues but the holes for the screws didn't line up between the aluminum case and the mounting holes on the plastic piece. I ended up using tape to keep the enclosure together. I do not recommend this product for any long term usage."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for.","review":"I had an issue with placing the hard drive in the enclosure and the reason was that the case and cutout holes for the usb connector did not line up well at all. For the price it works. It just took some messing around before I got it to come together. I thought I was going to break something before I got it to work. Other enclosures I have are easy to swap back and forth. This one I would not swap hard drives because of the difficulty it takes to place them properly. If you are looking for a cheap way to get an ATA 100 interface into a case, this is the buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"USB 2.0 2.5\\" IDE Drive Enclosure - Blue, WORKS GREAT!","review":"The drive case is slim, light, fits in your shirt pocket and fits the 2.5\\" drive perfectly. Don't worry about heat buildup unless you have an older USB1.1 port and are accessing the drive constantly over a long period of time. The inside of a laptop gets much warmer than this external case does. I don't swap drives since this case is so cheap I bought 3 of them for extra drives. I don't know how durable it would be to pull the connector off the hard drive if you swapped drives over and over but that seems silly to me anyway! The unit was totally plug and play on my Win XP system, no drivers or installation needed. It comes with a USB cable and drivers for older Win98/SE systems.

I had an older Maxtor 2.5\\" (plastic) One Touch III (mini edition) that would start only half of the time without using the extra power provided by the shorter \\"Y\\" USB cable being plugged in for the additional power. I think they used cheap wires for the power inside the case - Direct Current needs heavier wiring than AC.Fast forward about five years later - after installing the drive from the Maxtor enclosure into this new blue enclosure, the drive spun instantly without the need of the extra USB power Y. Not only that, but the files are saved/transferred about twice as fast.One note to would be buyers, make sure the enclosure you buy is IDE or SATA to fit the IDE or SATA drive you want to use. Do a Google search to see pictures of hard drives to compare with your drive to make sure you buy the right enclosure."},{"rating":"2","title":"good and cheap","review":"have two of these and they work with no problem glad to have found themi was able to transfer old files from a hard drive now i use as a portable"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well.","review":"I didn't give it a 5 becasue it is cheaply assembled.

I use Linux and it recognized the drive and I have been storing to it ever since.I will mention that this order was filled promptly and correctly but I will add that I had to order 3 times to get this drive. Not from this company, but from two others before this one. In both cases I was sent SATA drive enclosures, not IDE. I didn't complain the first time because I assumed it was my fault. But on the second order I was very specific that I was ordering an IDE enclosure but they sent a SATA anyway. I was instantly credited my full price when I complained and it was less than $5, but still.This enclosure came as ordered and quickly without any issues.I would do it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple and a little confusing","review":"Not sure why this thing has a forked usb connector, maybe I'm not using it right.

The drive inside is unsupported so it can move and rattle around. This is likely to kill any drive fairly quick if its transported. It might be ok to lay on your desk or something. My drive is now stuck inside as well. The screws to hold the enclosure together won't come out. You screw into black plastic and then to get them out you can unscrew forever and it doesn't come back out. I will end up needing to drill the screw out. Ruining the product and my chances of a return and possibly the drive I put inside of this. Oh yeah that's just the physical issues. This also doesn't work at all.

In this, I blame the editor, not the author; for an author may become so entranced with what to her may be a novel concept that she needs an editor to insist that the book also include plot, character and/or memorable language.

The bad thing is Kuga, as the writer, never grasped the personality or appeal of each character. The subtlety of the anime and the balance of the various personalities aboard the Bobop is lost. The most infuriating is Spike has taken on a whole new personality of stupidity. Instead of a cleverness hidden behind his nonchalant attitude, he has become Bebop's grunt, driven by hunger and little else. There's a reason the manga is being canceled after issue 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good- but with flaws","review":"It was a refreshing twist to the Bebop universe. Spike's style was made a little, um, too pushy. He cared too much for his ship. Ed is still Ed, but has a more animeish (is that a word?)look to her (him? not sure about it this time around.)Jet hasn't changed with the new artist, but Faye has turned into a snobby brat. The art is hectic in the fight scenes, but is okay as is. Is worth a look for hardcore Bebop fans, but not for newcomers. See you space cowboy."},{"rating":"1","title":"How do you ruin Cowboy Bebop? This is a big example!","review":"This series is a retelling of Cowboy Bebop supposedly, except for some reason Cain Kuga destroyed the characterization of everyone. Spike is now much lazier than the original, and lacks the laid back yet serious stature he has in the anime, Ed is now a whiny little brat, and Faye is nothing but a brainless (...) The artwork is ugly to look at... no, the character designs are okay, but the action is drawn so odd that it is impossible to tell what is going on. And the stories themselves are very lacking, they do not have the Bebop feeling that the anime does, and devoid of any characterization. Listen to this review: DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY LIKE I DID!

Consequently I have quit using the adapter and gone back to the built in hardware in my notebook as it gives about 30% better reception and more speed than the internet permits anyway.This is my second attempt at upgrading to N spec, maybe someday N spec will live up to the hype.I wouldn't waste your money on this unless you don't have any other options."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wireless N Express Card Adapters","review":"The D-Link Xtreme N Express Card Adapter, so far is the only N wireless express card adapter that I have found to have the capability for both the distance and the signal response through a house with stone walls.

The author seems very confused, in which he doesn't want people engaging in \\"scientism\\" and not to base your life on it, and that there's different types of science, and it shouldn't be closed off to new ideas, yet this guy sneaks in some asburd comments about creationism being pseudo science without ANY evidence. Yet clearly, his book is supposed to be against that type of discrimination. What a whopper of a mistake.

A very few of my friends agree that this movie is so far beyond bad that it's terrific. I've seen Ishtar more times than I can remember, and every time I laugh. If you're a little quirky, and if you're willing to take the movie as a song and character showcase (forget the plot!), then you may have found a new favorite movie to torture your loved ones with.I'm not kidding.Imagine if you will Dustin Hoffman and Warren Beatty singing (badly) these super lines:\\"I said come look there's a wardrobe of love in my eyes/ Come on in, take a look and see if there's something your size.\\"\\"Telling the truth is a dangerous business/ Honest and popular don't go hand in hand./ If you admit that you can play the accordion/ No one will hire you in a rock-n-roll band.\\"You live your life and I'll live mine, and mine will always include a copy of Ishtar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soundtrack available on Columbia Records & Tapes?

Perhaps they thought i was calling to see if their refrigerator was running or if they had Prince Albert in a can.I've heard a rumour that Hoffman personally bought all the copies of the CD and destroyed them. If so, it's a pity because this movie changed my life for the better. The hype surrounding its release was remarkable.

Who listens to them anyhoo?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Put, The Best","review":"I think it's a critique on our society when such an incredibly funny picture like this is universally scorned. It serves as a litmus test of the viewer's mental abilities. This film is not only funny, it's hilarious! Anyone who has ever written a bad song or poem will reel as Warren Beatty is immersed in the creative process, coming up with \\"Hot fudge love, cherry ripple kisses...\\" while driving his ice cream truck, oblivious to the disgruntled kids that can't get his attention. And who can't love his attempts to affirm Dustin Hoffman as the \\"Hawk\\", talking him down from the ledge with, \\"you would rather have nothin' that to settle for less...\\" Half of my friends love it, half hate it.

Maybe it was just self-indulgence and hubris that led them into the quicksand of this incredibly bad plot and execution. Or maybe they really thought they'd be the next Bob Hope/Bing Crosby team. Either way, \\"Ishtar\\" has become the byword for Hollywood dreck.

The press on this movie was so over-the-top bad that I just had to seek it out. And you know what? I totally agree with Warren Beatty's assessment that it's not necessarily great, but it's a very good comedy.The dialogue is clever much of the time and there are some really memorable lines (\\"Most musicians would KILL for a gig in North Africa\\") and scenes (the trek across the desert with the blind camel is just hilarious). The thing to remember when you watch Ishtar is that it was intended as an offbeat take on the old Bing Crosby/Bob Hope \\"Road to...\\" movies from the 1940's and 1950's...and I think it succeeds greatly here.Have an open mind, pop some popcorn and get ready to laugh.

I remember all of the hullaballo about how much it cost and how poorly it was received. So after twenty years I thought I would see for myself......UGH!.....and boy, was this one dull and not funny movie! What a waste of ability,especially Warren Beatty who truly was ridiculous in his role. Hoffman fares only slightly better. The humor falls absolutely flat and the film is consumed in it's own folly.I kept thinking if Will Ferrell could have made this any funnier. Hoffman and Beatty are two marvelous actors, but this film cannot be saved by their presence. In fact, their presence actually makes the film more impossible to sit through. The blind camel in the desert scene is painful to watch!!! Only the lounge singer episode in Morocco was even the slightest bit humorous.

In addition, I even took the one creative writing course he offered (and at the time I was very satisfied with the class). Because of this, I can honestly and confidently say that the author made up almost all of his situations to make himself out to be a superior to Appalachian natives he claims to 'know' so well. His repeated insults and sly innuendos do nothing but make him look like a fool to those who know the truth. 'Back home,' you can bet we all know the real reason he left was not his disappointment in Appalachia, but Appalachia's disappointment in him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic Misrepresentation","review":"Yes, I am educated enough to spell misrepresentation.

I also have already obtained an MCSE, MCSA, Dell Certified Technician, A+ Certification, Brainbench Computer Technical Support, ExPert Rating Computer Technical Support, and 17 other professional certifications. Could this be possible? Yes, it is. Morehead State University is a fine institution and there are not as many \\"hicks\\" roaming the streets as Mr. Offutt would like to believe. There is no mistaking his imaginative talent and excellent authorship, but his egotistical dreamland is very questionable. I would recommend this great work of FICTION to anyone out there who enjoys a good Kentucky redneck or imbreed joke because you are just as imaginative as Mr. Chris Awful (oops, eye lowst meye diktonary!!!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly genuine, his best book yet.","review":"Beautifully written, honest to the bone, No Heroes is a story of several intertwined personal journeys. Individual chapters are little pockets of insight into his past (his in-laws as well as his own) and into the present time of writing this story. Anyone who is brave enough to delve honestly into their own past will understand (and appreciate) the clarity, struggle and emotion of this memoir. In order to grow, we must reconcile with our past, face it head on with a fierce determination to see it for what it is and move forward. That takes guts.As someone else has mentioned, this memoir has layers and layers of meaning. It is sad, honest, funny and complex - just like life itself. When we \\"go home\\", it is never to the home we yearned for, it is a home that we see with different eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Condescending and self-absorbed","review":"I'm from the county Offutt writes about coming home to, and if we were really as backward and hickish as he describes us I would be leaving too. No, there's not a lot of opportunity here for our kids (most of whom do graduate from high school, and a good many from college). And yes, it's pretty provincial. But if what he tells here is what he really saw then he sure wasn't paying much attention. And if he really came here to save us from what he imagines is our way of life, all discount shopping and video stores and driving around in rusted-out trucks, it's no surprise he came away disappointed.He treats the story of his in-laws better, but the rest of this book doesn't deserve to be called \\"nonfiction.\\" Too bad a lot of people who don't know better will believe it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Fictional Memoir?","review":"Again,in an attempt to sell his work, Chris Offut has managed to fool those who view Appalachia as a vast wasteland of ignorance and despair into praising him for his \\"couragic portrayal\\" of the home he once knew. Having visited the area he manages to exaggerate, i felt as if a crime had been committed on the people of Rowan County, Ky. Not only is this book total fabrication, the words tend to flow off the page like a coal slurry spill in an Eastern Kentucky creek."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grossly inaccurate","review":"I made it through one chapter of NO HEROES which Offutt should think quite an accomplishment since I am from Eastern Kentucky and a graduate of Morehead State University. Not finishing the book has less to do with literacy or intelligence and more to do with an appreciation for accurate information (an appreciation clearly not shared by the author since he tosses around more fiction than fact). It seems quite tragic to me that someone with such a passion for \\"saving the uneducated\\" would now be so blatantly perpetuating the stereotypes he CLEARLY worked so diligently to overcome. I have found heroes all over Eastern Kentucky... my family, local educators, civic leaders, etc. However, I'm sure Mr. Offutt found NO HEROES here. He wasn't examining anyone but himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offutt fools 'em again","review":"Offutt continues to convince critics and more than a few readers he knows something about Appalachian Kentucky. Anyone familiar with the area who reads this book will find out how little familiarity with the area he really has.There are ludicrous factual errors (Morehead State University is _not_ the only four year college in the mountains), mistruths about people (one man he presents as being jealous that Offutt \\"escaped\\" Rowan County is as well-traveled an individual as I've ever met), and reported conversations that didn't happen (what \\"crossbow\\" in the film \\"Deliverance?\\"). He reports his local nickname is \\"Awful\\" Offutt, when in reality he's far more often referred to locally as \\"Outhouse\\" Offutt, for his weird tendency to insert outhouses in so many of his stories.Offutt is warmed over Breese Pancake (and if you don't know who that is you owe it yourself to find out), a poseur, a complete and utter fraud."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Dog In This Hunt","review":"I'm not from Kentucky and have never visited the state, so I can't speak to any factual errors that might be in this book. I CAN say that I found it an excellent read and it brought to life scenes I can have no personal experience of, whether they transpire in the hills of KY or in the prison camps of WWII. The juxtaposition of the Holocaust tales and the homecoming to Kentucky stories is unusual, but it worked for me; I've never felt so vividly what Jews went through under the Nazis.Looking at Chris Offutt's pictures and reading his words, I don't think I'd get along with him too well. He does seem to have a chip on his shoulder and seems haunted by some ghosts that elude his attempts to put them to rest. But he uses words well and gave me a couple of interesting hours inside his head...a nice place to visit, but I wouldn't--well, you know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Musings of an Egocentric Author","review":"According to Mr. Offut, I shouldn't have been able to spell \\"egocentric.\\" I grew up in the same region as the author, but still managed to learn how to read. Unfortunately, that ability led me to read his book.Given the opportunity to begin again, I wouldn't waste the time and effort it took to pick up this book, never mind reading it. The only thing that kept me turning pages was the curiosity of how he would make the next topic all about himself.Too bad he missed all the lovely things about eastern Kentucky while he was obsessing over what everyone thought of him.

Neil Peart is a very talented writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"elegant prose written in peart's lyrical style.","review":"As a fan of the band mr.peart is a member of, rush, i found it difficult to separate my internal images of peart on stage, in press releases and in videos from peart the author and private citizen. however, in order to truly appreciate the book for what it is, a chronicle of an african bicycle trip and the inter-personal relationships that form along the way, i felt it imperative to do exactly that.my first question as i read the book was, \\"will anyone recognize peart? would there be a fan on board to harangue him for the entire trip, \\"dude- you are the greatest drummer ever!!\\" but alas, he was lucky... until he gets to know elsa. (read the book to find out what i am referring to.)at certain points i found the book to be a bit pedestrian, but all in all, it was an enjoyable read. i will admit, however, that i probably enjoyed the book more because of who the author is."},{"rating":"2","title":"A short, honest look at Africa from a cyclists' view point.","review":"Something about the way Peart, ever examining the land and its people as he traveled reminded me of T.E. Lawrence's \\"Seven Pillars of Wisdom\\". Peart writes with the same kind of fearless honesty. This book is NOT politically correct. Then author faces issues between men and women, old and young, primitive and cultured. He meets them head on without prejudice or apology. He examines himself as ruthlessly as he does everything else and when he tires, settles down to study Aristotle or Vincent Van Gogh. Some of us march to the beat of a different drummer, Peart beats his own drum. Like his lyrics this book will leave you wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't we all just get along?","review":"Of course, I bought this book because I am a fan of Neil Peart. But, I had no idea what I was in for. As usual, Neil's intellect and perception led me into new understanding of things I knew little about. He has a way of describing things and events in a way that makes you feel as if you are there. He is very honest about his feelings which adds a great deal to the book. His story telling abilities approach the expertise of Jeffery Archer and his intellect is surpassed by few. Immense insight is what makes Neil such a prolific Lyricist and writer. This is one of the most interesting books I have read in a while. I just hope Neil writes a fictional novel sometime soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm a very big fan of Neil Peart and Rush.","review":"This book, masterfully written, lets you see inside Neil's mind. For me, it gave me real understanding of just how intensely he feels things and how intelligent he really is. Clearly he is well-read as well as observant and insightful. Now I see how he is able to write such brilliant song lyrics. I must admit, though, that at the point when he mentioned how he looked forward to seeing his then-ten-year-old daughter Selena, I had tears in my eyes (knowing that both she and her mother have passed away). This is a great read even if you aren't familiar with or particularly fond of Rush, but if you are, it will mean even more to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take it from me, I know!","review":"I have had the distinct pleasure and pain of taking the same bicycle tour as Neil. I read his book after I completed my tour for no reason other than to observe someone else's interpretation of the events. I was amazed to find his experiences almost identical to mine in every aspect from the makeup of the group to the gut-wrenching pain of the night. I was even more amazed by Neil's ability to recall and so eloquently illustrate the details of his journey. My journals lack by comparison. While reading this book, I felt as though I were a member of his tour group. I think anyone with imagination can.....that is the mark of a brilliant author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended reading for modern African Culture studies.","review":"This is a well written book that details the sights, sounds, smells, and attitudes of a contradictory modern and primative West African state. The striking contrasts between the \\"hellish\\" introduction to the journey and \\"heavenly\\" ending resound throughout the book in both the people he meets and the places he sees. It sounds like a ride I would like to take literally, and in reading this book I believe it is symbolic of a journey we all make. Read it. A recommended academic read for African Studies or literature in the same vein as Hemmingway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peart is incredible.","review":"Neil writes this book with the same passion for motion as the feel of a great Rush song. The book is a quick read and the reader's only disappointment is when it's over. Even people who don't listen to Rush will be very pleased. His style is his own but, you can sense all of the literary greats he has absorbed and is mirroring now ie; Rand, Hemingway, Tolkien, etc. I can't ever wait for a new Rush album and I feel the same about the next Peart book. His next book is about touring with Rush. Looking forward to it Neil."},{"rating":"2","title":"A constant, thoughtful observer...","review":"From cover to cover, Neil Peart takes the reader, not only through the West African land, but to its people as well. Throughout the book, I felt as if I was along for the ride with him as he observes and explains his feelings and attitudes on the people he meets as well as the ones who are traveling with him. As a Rush fan, I knew Neil was a great lyricist and was confident that his first book would be enjoyable. He did not dissapoint!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond a 1,000 miles","review":"Once again, Neil gives us a gift through words.

This book isn't really about bicycling at all, though riders should enjoy that facet of the book.

I took this album on a business trip back in 2004, and this was the only cd I would listen in the stack of 50 I brought with me. I enjoyed most of the songs, especially Candy. This reminded me a lot of my female friends I wanted to cross the line with but never did. LOLBeep You, Anymore, Don't Go, Gin Dancer, and Ghetto were amongst my favorite. With exception to Streetwalker and Everything I Could, this album was very festive and upbeat. Even for the two slower songs, they were very well written & executed.

While the first Conan film was serious and did the genere complete justice, this crap was an H.R. Puff n Stuff Saturday morning garbage fest. Bad acting, way too many caracters, one ridiculous sidekick (who I wish was killed off in the first 30 seconds of the movie.)and ...Wilt Chamberlin? This story was as bad as the Ewoks in Jedi. And the music, while perfect in the original, is recycled here. Some parts are exact copies of the first score. How 'bout some originality here? Unless your 7 years old or have a mind like one, don't buy it. Arnold needs to do another Conan movie so we can forget about this one. With today's special effects and some intelligent writing it could surpass even the original Conan episode.

I was wrong.Arnold was his usual stoic self. Chamberlain did his best [which wasn't much]. He looked as if he was constantly searching for a basketball. Mako was fine. The dialog was terrible and boring. It seemed all the virgin [Olivia d'Abo] could say was \\"Bombaata!\\" BORING! Arnold's comic sidekick was chilling in his inability to act and speak. The evil queen was wooden and her court advisors were barely two dimensional.Save your money. Leave this one on the shelves and buy \\"Conan the Barbarian\\". \\"CtB\\" was a good example of pulp fiction movies. \\"CtD\\" was the exact opposite. El Stinko Deluxe. The ONLY value in the whole movie was Mako. Unfortunately, he wasn't enough to raise this one to even a two star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be too anxious to buy this sequel of the original Conan the Barbarian","review":"I'm sure many of us truly embrace the original \\"Conan the Barbarian\\" with Arnold Schwarzenegger, but nothing could be more disappointing as a sequel than this release of \\"Conan the Destroyer.\\" What a lame, campy movie this is. It's like a low budget porn film, but with no real porn, just a blonde girl with a pretty face (and a cute overbite), the masculine black girl, and alot of bad acting from everyone, including Arnold.I am so glad that they didn't release the two Conan films together in a twin-pak because I just simply do not want this movie in my collection. I'd like to forget that this movie even exists. I would think Arnold would too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soylent Conan","review":"This movie was directed by Richard Fleischer, of \\"Soylent Green\\" fame. And everything about this movie is just about that hilariously bad. Here's what makes it total doo doo:1) Script2) Cast selection3) Acting4) Direction & Camera Work5) Effects6) The utter and absolute betrayal and abandonment of anything resembling RE Howard's Conan of Cimmeria.I gave this movie a second star simply because there are a few funny moments that at least make this a lighhearted journey into awfulness.Let me sum it up this way:Remember in the *real* Conan movie when the black lotus seller tells Subotai and Conan: \\"Black lotus, Stygian, the best,\\" and Subotai says, \\"This better not be hagga!\\" and the seller says, \\"I would not sell hagga to slayers such as yourselves.\\"Well, slayer, if you bought this movie you've just been sold a big fat bag of hagga....It ain't the real thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"omg","review":"I'd give this movie lots'o stars. I like it. It's not long and boring like the first. There's some good swordfights. There's some magic. There's Arnold. BUT! There is also some major butchering of the gore scenes. I cringed when I watched my dvd, as I realised there were at least 3-4 scenes that had been cut. Because of this I'm takin' a bunch of stars back. One star for Arnold, and one for the swords/whole conan-setting.Don't buy until there's an uncut version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conan the D...umb","review":"Very dissapointed but this sequel. In fact I always remembered the first movie when I saw it when I was 9-10 years old and I buy it on DVD just a couple months ago (I'm 28 yo now). But I didn't remember this second part. NOw I know why! I just rent it a couple days ago to see if it's worth buying it on DVD, it doesn't. Obviously was made for children, not like the first part.

Best regards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gonad the Ballbarian","review":"So Conan and friends - including Wilt Chamberlain as Bombaata and Grace Jones as Zula - are on a mission to protect a virgin princess who gets a powerful horn for the queen. Let me get this straight, someone thought it was a good idea to make a sequel to Conan the Barbarian, AND they thought it would be a good idea to cast Wilt Chamberlain to play a warrior who protects a maiden's virginity? Maybe the casting director's next choice can be OJ as a babysitter, or Steve Martin as funny.Look, I loved the original. It was epic. Everything from the story and action to even the score was great. But this sequel is abysmal, and it ruined what could have been (was supposed to be?) a trilogy of Conan movies. When Arnold is the guy in the film with the most polished acting chops, there is something extremely wrong.I would have walked out on this movie if I were watching it on an airplane."},{"rating":"1","title":"An ABSOLUTE EMBARRASEMENT!!!","review":"This movie was a waste of time and money!

Get \\"Conan the Barbarian\\" and be happy, and never touch this one. I can see how this could appeal to a Xena watcher, but I really would have expected better after seeing Conan the Barbarian and reading tons of the Conan and other Robert Jordan books. To sum up, this is a PG rated movie. Conan is not a PG-man. Try taking Rambo and remaking it as a PG movie with funny characters involved.. you get the point. cheers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond embarassing sequel","review":"After director John Milius crafted a classic with the big screen adaptation of Conan the Barbarian, Universal pumped out this sequel two years later aimed at a younger crowd. Arnold Schwarzenegger returns as Conan, and is undoubtadly the best thing about this film which almost parodies the original. Also featured is one of the campiest casts ever assembled which includes Grace Jones and Wilt Chamberlain. All in all, Conan the Destroyer isn't a bad film on it's own when you don't compare it to the original or take it seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Conan","review":"Conan, Beastmaster, and Legend are my 3 favorite fantasy movies to this day. Ancient Earth warfare and dark magic with hotties! This is a Spike TV type movie for guys who like to eat meat and lift weights with a beer in one hand and a gorgeous blond in the other. Although not Lord of the Rings quality, certainly in the top 10 best fantasy movies ever. You won't regret buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sword and the Toad","review":"This is an absurd and hastily made sequel to the far superior Conan the Barbarian. Swartz is back as the big hulking paleoanthropic warrior who has more muscle than brains. This time around the landscape looks like something out of a cheap fantasy movie and nothing ever clicks or feels like the original. The difference with this is that the first film had a believability to it and this one just oozes out vacuous emptiness. The plot concerns a princess who must fight an evil sorceress. . . not much there to begin with. Along the line there are more absurd characters including Grace Jones who resembles a twig and beats men 8 times her size with a stick. Chamberlain is even more lackluster as a personal guard to the spoiled princess who has special powers to defeat darkness. Look for the awful 'non-moving face' monster in the hall of mirrors that is about as scary as a dead fish. Even as a kid I hated this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conan The Destroyed","review":"With this cheap sequel, the epic grace of the original Conan itself sinks to the level of all the B movies that sought to imitate it. An utterly pathetic sequel that Schwarzenegger should have shunned.Although the plot was fine, it was the screenplay itself which ruined this film. The whole script was riddled with bad dialogue and stupid action scenes. In contrast to the original's cast of solid characters, the sequel has Conan accompanied by a pack of totally unappealing characters. The worst character is the sidekick thief, Malek, whose only purpose is to utter bad one-liners and act as the buffoon. As for Chamberlain, I'm sorry but the guy can't even act well in a low-grade 'B' film and should have stayed with basketball.Don't waste your money either buying or renting this film: it's not worth a dime. The only time I saw this film is when it was originally released on the big screen: I don't care to ever watch it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"in-depth and excellent","review":"Great to know that Yazoo, a label which has released dozens of great, ancient recordings (a personal favorite is the Secret Museum of Mankind series), has, in the wake of several modern variations on Bulgarian folk music, released this awesome package. The variety of compositions and arrangements of this traditional music is well documented here, and the informative liner notes are great to have.

I recommend people get the single disc edition.The movie itself is ok... since i got the dvd i find that i'm skipping a lot of parts, because it's just too long and it drags for me in certain parts. Heath Ledger as he joker is what saves this movie for me for sure.

The Blu-Ray transfer also is terrific. I have no complaints about it. It only enhances the fun of viewing this film.This also is a great film to enjoy audibly with some fantastic surround sound. In fact, the sound on this B-D is as good as the visuals.There are absolutely no dry spots in this fascinating story. Does everything make sense? Of course not; there are a lot of holes in the story, but it's a superhero action film and it's not meant to be dissected for credibility. It's just supposed to entertain, and that it does.A large part of the credit for that goes to Heath Ledger for his \\"The Joker\\" portrayal. Every scene in which Ledger appeared was riveting. His speech, mannerisms and his dialog were fantastic. For the latter, I have to commend the screen writers who gave Ledger some great lines!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bright day for Dark Knight","review":"This movie is one of my favorites of all time.

It was basically the same stuff you could see on HBO when they were doing a special on the movie. Where are the interviews with Heath..?..Why don't they show Heath filming the scenes...?...etc. I can only assume they didn't include anything in respect to his family (?) but I don't understand how that would be disrespectful. The other reason might be that they are waiting to release ANOTHER special edition so people buy the movie again for the new special features which would tick me off.The movie itself as everyone already knows is great. I would have liked a bigger scene for Cillian Murphy (scarecrow) but his character wasn't really necessary in this movie.I give this 4 out of 5 because the movie is awesome...minus 1 for the LACK of special features."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Movie Ever","review":"I love this movie and saw it was SUCH a great deal that I had to get it!

The variable aspect ratio was very confusing at first. I had to do some research that showed that this movie was filmed using two cameras.The IMax camera used is not as wide aspect ratio as most movies, and on this Blu-ray it's 16:9. The rest of the movie is filmed on a normal camera and is wide screen.In the end I'm glad they used varable aspect ratio to maintain the original aspect ratios.The sound is only 5.1 which is unfortunate, but that's all that was available I suspect.I would recommend this Blu-Ray"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie, incredible Bluray!","review":"Watching this on a proper home theater almost makes me wish I hadn't seen it in theaters first!

I have Avatar and Alice in wonderland on it so i know how gorgeous a BR can look on my system, along with HD tv channels. I bought this because i was such a big fan of the movie and wanted an HD copy on disk. I was severely let down when i popped this in. The definition is about dvd quality. The rendering is so bad it because pix-elated throughout the movie, especially in blacks, which it most of the movie.

Maggie Gyllenhal, a woman who has been able to construct a career despite being half Pekingese was killed off half way though but still, a very long movie. I'm sorry but Heath Ledger, a very hot man, should not have been subjected to all that face makeup. He could have and would have played the Joker much better with just his normal gorgeous face.Because of the movie, I have cut off ties with Chris Nolan and we are no longer friends. I have deleted his name from my phone book and have ignored all his texts, even when he wanted to go to the Sanrio store in Tokyo and said I could have whatever I wanted.

The Joker never ever fooled Batman pyschologically.Batman is now just another vigilante. The movie is far too long, with too much violence. Cell phone networks are incapable of doing what Batman had it do.

But I agree with what many other people said: the movie was WAY too long, the plot made no sense, I couldn't understand Gary Oldman, and the amount of violence was absolutely ridiculous. The first hour was better than I expected, but then it was as if the producer said, \\"Wait a minute! There haven't been enough explosions or car-chases!\\" And then you get at least 40 minutes of almost non-stop explosions and car-chases, interspersed with numerous killings. I say \\"at least 40 minutes\\" because we turned it off after about 2 hours.

I don't enjoy these action movies lately like the Batman series and Bourne Identity that are completely lacking in humour or whimsy. Give me the Spiderman and X-Men type stuff any day.During the second half (of what seemed like a 5 hour movie), I was dozing off...and I don't feel any need to go back and see what I missed.I didn't like Batman Begins and I don't like this either. Actually now that I check director Christopher Nolan's resume, I didn't like \\"The Prestige\\" either.

But I thought it overlong. The bits with the transformed District Attorney and the dueling ferry boats could easily stand alone as movies. I thought Christian Bale was somewhat bland as Batman.

Much of it was breathtaking, and I can understand how Batman fans could love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"Heath Ledger's performance as The Joker was OUTSTANDING; no one else will ever be able to get it right after him. Other than that, the movie was about an hour and a half too long and more than a little boring - I actually fell asleep a couple of times. I like Christian Bale as Batman except for his Batman voice, which annoyingly sounded like he'd been eating rusty nails.

We simply could not get into the story or stop laughing anytime BATMAN would talk in that strange digitally altered voice they tried to use.I am an old comics collector and love the whole Superhero universe but I don't see the cause for excitement over this movie. Pretty flat.BUT THE BIGGEST IRRITATION that most likely contributed to us not finishing the movie was the annoying sound and audio levels.We had to watch the movie with the REMOTE in hand because dialoque was almost impossible to hear yet sound effects, music and other audio effects were vibrating and overloading our speakers.The entire time watching the film was like a video game with the thumb RIDING THE VOLUME KNOB up and down and up and down, etc..Horrible.... sound and audio mixing that ruined the potential enjoyment of the film.

In fact, I saw it seven times in the theater. As a result of its great success and the huge buzz over Heath Ledger's legendary performance and tragic demise, I figured The special edition DVD would blow my mind-hole. This certainly was not the case. The only decent special features are an interview with Hans Zimmer and others from the production crew about casting the score, and a featurette on the technology Batman utilizes. The other features (the full-framed IMAX scenes, a few mocked-up episodes of \\"Gotham Tonight\\", and a picture gallery) could have been left off as far as I'm concerned. No commentaries, no gag reels, no deleted or extended scenes, and not even a word about Ledger. Those are the things that make a SE DVD worth shelling out extra money for.If I had looked up the DVD to check out the special features before pre-ordering it, I'd have gotten the single disc edition. I suggest you do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Despicable","review":"I would give this movie negative stars if I could. Wheezes and puffs to be taken seriously, but what's the point?

Then I saw it! WOW! The film is amazing on every level. Heath Ledger took a well known and often played character and made it his own. This is not your dad's Joker...this is the Joker that terrorized us in The Dark Knight Returns and the Killing Joke (2 of the finest Batman graphic novels) and he elevated it. The hero is only as good as his villain and this movie delivered. See it! All of you! Even if you don't like comic books or superhero movies!This is not for kids under 16 (13 if you are a liberal). Save your money the 2 disc special edition is not special at all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dark Knight","review":"I bought the movie for my son who is 17. He loves this movie.

I am a huge nerd, I mean Batman fan. Now the ones with Arnold and Halle, those were awful. I mean, really awful. The very first one with the penguin was good but very outdated. But these last two, wow. The Dark Knight was phenomenal. Heath, RIP, did an amazing job. He captured the joker better than I could have ever imagined. Bale, always good.My only complaint is Rachel. She doesn't really seem like \\"the Rachel\\" to me. Now Katie Holmes was a good Rachel, a believable Rachel. Simple kind of pretty, yet elegant and strong. Unfortunatelty, Maggie Gyllenhaal was used in The Dark Knight. Maybe I just don't like the actress, but she was not at all what I had always envisioned, she's just sort of sad looking (not in a good way).Other than Ms. Gyllenhaal, the film was excellent. And I hear it leads well into the next one? After these last two, I am VERY excited to see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT MOVIE!!!!!! NOLAN IS THE MAN.","review":"Nolan creates a new superheroe movie genre with \\"Begins\\" and \\"The Dark Night\\", it would be great to see how other Batman comic villians are developed in sequels with this same \\"more real characters\\" concept, just hope Nolan keeps on charge of directing these. It would also have been fantastic that this same concept had been applied to the desastrous \\"Superman Returns\\" film, altough this would be much more difficult becouse Batman has no superpowers and that's why he can be more real. Superman haves superpowers, which opposes to this concept, so after \\"The Dark Night\\" it's going to be an almost impossible mission for directors to create this same atmosfer with a Superman film. Sad, Superman is my favorite superhero, but \\"The Dark Night\\" is definetly my favorite superhero movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Knight + Blu-Ray","review":"Lots of high definition growling and a guy with green hair and face paint.What more could you ask for?too bad they replaced Katie Holmes for what's her face."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"Loved this movie.

Lots of scenes that aren't plotted. Granted, The Joker is the best part of the movie. Batman, eh, becomes quite uninteresting after 80 minutes of action scene after action scene - salt and peppered with character building actor scenes - that seemingly have nothing to do with plot. This is a great example of a movie people like because mass media told them to like it. The first Batman is far superior."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dissenting opinion","review":"It seems like everyone liked the movie, but I found it very long, slow and full of sloppy sentimentalism. The good vs evil angle that the movie tries to take gets very tiresome - it gets preachy without being profound, with cheesy lines. The plot makes no sense. \\"Moneyball\\" was way more engaging, thoughtful and entertaining than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superhero movie","review":"This is a 2008 movie.

So watching on a 16:9 (widescreen) TV, sometimes there's bars on the top and bottom of the movie, and sometimes the movie fills the whole screen. It's definitely a little weird. And it switches back and forth during a scene change. Some may not notice it, and I didn't get too distracted, but it was a little odd and I could see some people getting annoyed with it. I'm not sure if the one you'd buy at the store would be the same or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth Much More","review":"To begin with, I loved the Dark Knight. I think it was one of the best movies to come out in 2008. But I'm reviewing the product here, not the movie.I got the single disc full-screen DVD for Christmas, and was initially excited. But when I popped it in, I realized that it had NO extra features except subtitles. I mean none. This product is just the movie, so if that's all you want, go for it. But personally, I feel like the Dark Knight is well worth springing a little extra cash on to get some extras."},{"rating":"2","title":"FILM IS A MASTERPIECE. THIS DVD...NOT SO MUCH.","review":"I won't waste time rehashing what everyone knows about this movie, I'm chiming in to tell you to BEWARE that the supplements on this fabulous 2-Disc Edition SUCK. They are MINIMAL at best, and the sheer fact that WB or the filmmakers couldn't be bothered to stop counting money long enough to put together a 5 minute tribute to Heath Ledger is appalling.I guess this is yet another example of the studios soaking us for money...I'm sure there'll be an \\"EXTENDED\\" or \\"DIRECTORS CUT 4 DISC EDITION\\" down the line someday soon.Warner apparently realized the audience for this disc would be huge, so they didn't feel like they had to put any effort into the extras. Sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated in nearly every way","review":"Don't get me wrong, it's not a totally terrible movie, but this movie is pretty incoherent.

What I receieved is not. I ordered what was pictured, the Steelbook, well when the packaged finally arived I was super excited to see my steelbook since I'm nerd of those. Well, once I opened my package I saw I did not recieve the steelbook, instead I got the default blueray of The Dark Knight with 3 discs(with The Joker on the cover art) Extremely upset, I will be returning this first thing tomorrow. Looks like I gotta go in store and pay a whole lot more because I cant trust getting these anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, bad HD service from amazon","review":"I am a huge fan of Amazon, outside of this comment I have nothing but great things to say about them and their exceptional customer service. Also, my star rating was not because this was a bad movie. I give this a one star because I could not rent it in HD on my computer. I ended up renting it through the itunes store, for $1 cheaper and able to watch it on my computer. Amazon says that HD is only available for amazon instant video devices such as roku, xbox, PS3, etc. I know they are trying to drive sales of those devices, but I think this is a huge mistake. I buy everything on amazon for the convenience and great customer service, but this huge disadvantage drove me to rent the movie from Apple. (Until this I hadn't paid for something from apple since I started buying my music and movies from Amazon 2 years ago). Please fix the problem Amazon, or I will continue enjoying HD movies on my computer courtesy of Apple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joker Bank Robber Mask A Nice Bonus","review":"I am a huge Dark Knight fan mainly because I am obsessed with Heath Ledger's portrayal of The Joker. I needed a good DVD copy of The Dark Knight so I immediately jumped on this cool Best Buy edition box set with the BONUS Joker Bank Robber Mask. The mask is made out of hard plastic and is machine painted. While the mask is not as nice as the Side Show busts that came with the Universal Monsters box set it is still a cool collectible piece to add to your Dark Knight or Joker collection. The set also comes with the Two-Disc Special Edition DVD and a Bonus digital copy of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Movie - Bad DVD","review":"The DVD was defective about 5 mins into the move.

However, either the theater employees turned up the volume on the music, or the music track played way too loud so that the dialogue could not be heard. What was said at the end of the movie was lost in the loud music. The loud music ruined hearing the last words. I hope that the last dialogue of the DVD is not spoiled like it was in the theater. (Repetition for emphasis) I may rent The Dark Knight first, before I buy it, to make sure that the dialogue is not overpowered by the music score."},{"rating":"1","title":"Batman or Freud?","review":"This is similar to doing a remake of Sleeping Beauty and having the plot revolve around the challenges of narcolepsy! Come on - it's supposed to be a COMIC BOOK. Escapsim! I turned the movie off half-way through, 'cause it was so lame. The Joker's profound and disturbing schizophrenia, the struggle between Batman as hero or vigilante - it might be a wonderful movie, but it's not \\"Batman\\" I may be dating myself, but I'll stick with Jack Nicholson's \\"Joker\\" portrayal - over the top, comic book villain. I've got nothing against a serious portrayal of the emotional issues discussed in this movie, but it struck me as false advertising to suck me into a BATMAN movie and then pass this thing off on me. I think the legacy of this movie is that it will be a classroom presentation for abnormal psych classes in colleges. Possibly valuable, but certainly not the reason I wanted to see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Junior High School Production!!","review":"I was given this movie as a gift. I didn't get all the through it before destroying it and throwing it away (I wouldn't want anyone else having to suffer through it on my account)! This is an all-to-typical example of Hollywood trash advertised as \\"something big.\\" The plot line was flat and disjointed (or totally incoherent in some spots), the acting just ok, and the character development - well, there was none. The writers, if I can call them that, had the police doing things that no normal police agency would dream of doing!All in all this is a pathetic movie for adults to have made and I would hope that all involved in its production are sufficiently embarassed. However, if it were a junior high movie project I probably would have given it a higher score.

I can't set the lens to widescreen mode on this movie or I'll crop the top and bottom off all the 1.78:1 scenes.

The bonus DVD has very little on it, and what is there is entirely unintersting. Nothing about Heath Ledger's performance, no comments at all from any of the cast on any topic, no comments from Nolan, very little breakdown of any special effects scenes, nothing on the film prep, rehearsals, sets, shots - just utterly, totally lacking.I feel totally ripped off, I have to admit. I was exciting about getting this package - and it's just a huge letdown.Just buy the movie by itself - the bonus DVD is garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap extras","review":"WHile everyone goes on and on about this film, I think we should also inspect the DVD: it is crap. No commentary, no behind the scenes (unless you want to know about the bat suit or the batpod or the IMAX feature). I think IMAX must have co produced the DVD because most of the extras are all about the IMAX... big whoop.Save your money, but the single disc version: you really aren't getting all that more with the double dic version"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Movie","review":"I already knew I loved this movie. Huge fan of the whole trilogy. Too bad it's come to an end."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are twenty something and hopped up on enough testosterone...","review":"If you are twenty something and hopped up on enough testosterone this film may provide exactly the right stimulus to arouse a fixated, intense reaction from barely contained obsessions, unbearable cravings and suppressed playground rages. For everyone else, it will be a stone cold snooze. Ridiculous, shallow, silly, childish and ultimately boring. It is also by turns sadistic, cruel, mean spirited and filled with dark psycho babble that passes for profundity. There are so many other ways this story could have been told, ways that this film could have been made, interesting, innovative ways. Fanboys may salivate and rant and rage at any suggestion that this cinematic drug was not the ultimate high. But the question remains: Will the Batman idea ever produce a good movie? Not here, not yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dark Knight","review":"This is one of my most favorite movies ever. Christopher Nolan is a Genius. A must see. Heath Ledger is brilliant and Christian Bale is a boss"},{"rating":"2","title":"Info on the Bat Pod","review":"This is just some information regarding the Bat Pod. Please be aware, the Bat Pod and the display stand are 100% plastic. The Bat Pod is also not removable.In my opinion, they are not worth the extra money.Get the film, but don't splurge on this plastic toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Had to have this one.","review":"It is what it is, the darkest Batman movie to date. Gotta love the way Heath Ledger portrays the Joker, he totally nailed it! This maniac killer totally creeps you out, well deserved Oscar for Heath....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark but very entertaining","review":"Heath Ledger gives an epic performance. Moves quickly, drama and suspense are well done - you're never bored. Nice camera work, good acting - as usual Zimmer provides a great score. All around a great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vaguely familiar","review":"I found this movie to be vaguely familiar. The general tone of the movie seemed similar to many other films. (It could just about pass for a French action movie.) The movie itself is not bad. But, it was not great either. It is one of those 'big' movies that would have been much more appreciated on the big screen than the little screen.The single disk DVD has the movie and pretty much nothing else."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dark Pod Blue-Ray","review":"I gave it 4 stars only because the bat-pod display isnt functional at all, and gets old to look at it rather quick because there isnt anything that you can do with the pod. Plus I have a problem were to display it, but its still sweet and I would buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great performances---contorted plot","review":"Who wouldn't want Michael Caine for her valet? The actors in this movie were excellent and the performances, top notch. Both villains were weird enough and sympathetic enough to hold attention. Batman himself suffers over his decision to be a city-saver, giving up romance and the full-time cushy life.I hope there will be another installment. I am not a huge movie person but have enjoyed this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie - digital download has audio issues","review":"This is the first movie I have purchased from Amazon that included a free digital downloaded copy of the movie. I was very excited to watch the movie through the Xbox 360 acting as a Media Center Extender. The picture quality was great but the audio was lacking. I am not sure what the problem was exactly, but we definitely noticed it. We had to turn the volume up really loud to hear the characters talking and would then get blasted when there was a higher volume potion of the movie. So, we ended up putting the actual DVD in and watching it that way. The audio was MUCH better after that. It has completely turned me off to Amazon digital downloads though. I don't think I will ever buy one. If a movie I want comes with one for free, I might try again but I'm not holding my breath for it to be any better. Besides that, the movie was great and very entertaining. It's not a dark as people had led me to believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"No digital copy included","review":"The format and versions box on the Amazon product description states \\" Blu-Ray Widescreen edition + digital copy.\\" There is no digital copy. There are two discs. One is the movie with BD live. The other disc contains special features. There is no separate sheet with digital copy download information. Amazon's low price is deceptive."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dark Knight","review":"I absolutely love this movie, so I not only ordered one for my daughter for Christmas but ordered one for myself just because. My opinion, best Batman movie ever!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"I never did watch this movie when it came out because of Heath Ledger passing away. I finally watched it because there is a part two coming out. It's a great movie and I would suggest it to anyone who is a Batman fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest movie of all time","review":"By far this is the greatest Batman movie of all time. This movie has everything from action/adventure to drama to romance. It is by far the greatest movie in history. enough said. Highly recommend this movie for all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must see","review":"Great movie great acting by Bale and Ledger the best batman movie yet by far. Oldmans acting was perfect commisioner gordan. All around very good acting by the entire cast. The critics got this one right Ledgers jocker is the best acting I have seen in a long time and better than any character in any batman movie. The movie is full of action and has a good story line. A must see for any batman fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Dark Knight and Colorful Joker","review":"This movie was much better than I thought it would be. The story and characters were interesting and multi-faceted. I was really impressed with both Christian Bale and Heath Ledger. It is too bad a talented actor like Heath died so young. Christian Bale is pretty impressive too but his role in this film is not one of star. The other actors in small roles are wonderful and this is a successful big budget movie. There is the obligatory big noises and special effects and that can be a bit wearing at times. Still the story moves on at an exciting pace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save $10 DO NOT get 2 Disc!","review":"I usually LOVE 2 disc special editions. Typically, they have deleted or extended scenes, director commentary, and interviews with the actors.This has NONE of those! The 2nd disc is a waste! No actor interviews, no commentary...all it has is a silly interview with the composer, and some fake \\"Gothom Tonight\\" shows.Seriously, Heath Ledger gives one of the best villain performances of all times, and there isnt one interview?!?!? Nothing at all. You'd never even realize he was in the movie if you only saw the \\"Bonus Disc\\"Save $10 and just get the single disc...cuz the 2nd disc is nothing more than a coaster.Or, go get Iron Man or Tropic Thunder, which actually had GREAT 2nd discs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie. Alternating aspect ratios on Blu-ray annoying.","review":"I'm not reviewing the movie. That's been covered ad nauseam. I'm reviewing the Blu-ray disk. First the good points. The 1080p/VC-1 encode is excellent. The Dolby TrueHD 5.1 Surround Sound(48kHz/16-bit)audio is also excellent. Since I bought this movie to show off my HDTV and surround sound you'd think I'd be very happy. But I'm disappointed. The Dark Knight' is shown in alternating aspect ratios. The majority of the film is 2.40:1, while the IMAX-filmed segments are 1.78:1. I find this switching back and forth very distracting. Its not so bad during the long scenes, but during the short scenes it's very annoying. The IMAX filmed scenes also look better, which of course makes the regular shots look worse. All in all, it's not a bad Blu-ray movie, but I'm definitely not a fan of the alternating aspect ratios."},{"rating":"2","title":"dark knight","review":"The movie was GREAT.The dvd was in good shape and I received it on time. Good people to deal with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"As far as \\"superhero\\" movies go its probably the best I have seen so far. The joker made this movie great. Although I do not think the movie itself deserved an oscar I do think Heath Ledger did. He redefined the concept of \\"arch-criminal\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great Dark Knight","review":"Seen this movie on IMAX, the Blu-ray version just as good. Definately recommend watching it on 1080p.Great experience all around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Knight","review":"I think it is a great movie for adults but I find it a little to dark for kids under 17. A lot of images were very scary and especially on this DVD. The movie is great for anyone over 17. I enjoyed the movie immensely"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"Really great Batman movie especially for the price/ value. Superhero fans will be extremely pleased and not have many objections"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Display - No DVD Box - Great Movie!","review":"First I will say this movie is great! 5 Stars!However, I would have to agree with others on the bad points.1. The Batpod is made of very cheap plastic, worth maybe $2.00.2. The DVD's are stored in the plastic shield of the Batpod with no standard DVD case. The biggest problem with this is that once you open the main box and discover how cheap the plastic really is, it is too late. You will most likely not be able to return it as the shield that holds the DVD's does not have a seal. Intentional???My recommendation is to buy the Blu-Ray DVD+Digital Copy for $23.99 without the Batpod! Do not waste the extra money. Use the extra $24 to buy another DVD and have 2 movies instead of 1 and a cheap piece of plastic.This was a Christmas gift. I only wish I had read these reviews about the Batpod before putting it on my wish list. I will see if I can exchange it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did I buy this?","review":"I heard the reviews, everyone says it was awesome. Thought I'd give it a chance. Couldn't get past Batmans overly gravelly voice. Annoyed the heck out of me throughout the movie. Ledger played a good Joker. Watched once, could care less to see it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful seller","review":"I had been wanting the dark knight movie for awhile. I found it on amazon and saw that it was the one that had the slip cover that goes over the blu ray the inequality that i wanted so i bought it. Now it said it was the blu ray two disc special edition and came with the digital copy. Well when i got the movie it didn't have the slip cover the package was open when it said it was brand new. There was only the blu ray and no digital copy when i contacted the seller they told me that there not goin to give me a replacement one the right one that i paid for. I contacted amazon and they did the a to z form and they gave me my money back so i would rate this not even one star"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the Batmans","review":"Both Cristian Bale and Heath Ledger gave outstanding starring performances, with Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman also appearing at the top of their craft."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripped off!","review":"This 2-disc Special Edition DVDs deserve negative stars. There should be a class action lawsuit against Warner Brothers for misleading/false advertising. Don't get me wrong - I enjoyed The Dark Knight movie. However, the 2-disc Special Edition DVDs made me vomit. There were no deleted scenes, no director commentary, no cast and crew interviews, etc. on the second disc. If Kevin Smith had bought these DVDs he would tell Warner Brothers to smoke his big fat !@#$. Allow me to make the conjecture that Warner Brothers is going to release an \\"Ultimate Edition\\" of The Dark Knight in order to milk the fans. I for one would like a refund of my $15 IMAX ticket and $20.99 for the DVDs please.If you must have The Dark Knight, go with the single disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Special About This Edition","review":"I have been a lifelong movie & avid DVD fan. For the first time I have been cheated. This movie is absolutely '*****' spectacular, however if your looking for a depth of extras on this bonus disk, you'll come up pretty empty. Nearly every film these days is also prepped for DVD during production, so there really is no excuse for such a lackluster release of the biggest film of the year.There is NO AUDIO COMMENTARY, NO IN DEPTH PRODUCTION DOCUMENTARY, & the only substantial extra feature you get is 6 COMPLETELY WORTHLESS 'GOTHAM TONIGHT' news segments played in the background of the film.The Blu-Ray version contains 'Gotham Uncovered' sequences (total running time about 35 min.). I there was plenty of space to include these features (& many more) on this release. This version is a rotten apple. Why bother with the Special Edition at all, Warner Bros?"},{"rating":"1","title":"VHS VERSION?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!","review":"Ok, i find it stupid and asinine that they only release this product for BR (bleu-raes) and DVD (direct video demand), but NOT for VHS (video home system)!!!!!!!!! year after year i see less and less films available for VHS! this sucks! my collection is completely ruined if i conform and start buying BRs or DVDs--the cases are too skinny and look RETARDED next to my good old VHS discs! PLEASE release this one on VHS! i just LOVE Hairy Potter and want it sooo hard on home media!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Votes seem a bit low","review":"The original modern BATMAN with Michael Keaton remains one of my favorite comic book action movies. Although it has some humorous parts it is basically a drama. BATMAN FOREVER is much more tongue-in-cheek, tries to be much more witty, and succeeds much of the time. Val Kilmer is OK as Bruce Wayne and Batman, but Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey are just out of their minds good as the evil nemeses of society and Batman. So much so that it almost becomes their movie, with Batman finding his new partner, Robin (Chris O'Connell), a circus trapeze performer, as almost a side story. Nicole Kidman, as we have become accustomed, is just perfect as Wayne's love interest. I don't rate this film very highly, probably \\"7\\" on a 10-point scale, but with a very aggressive sound track, and really vile villians, it is entertaining if you like the genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"SORRY, BUT I DON'T \\"GET IT.\\"","review":"Confusing, dull plot. Heath Ledger was too good as The Joker: Too evil, too sinister, too serious, too sickenly scary. I wouldn't want my kids to see this Joker and that means neither should I. I want to sleep at night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total waste of time, watch grass grow instead","review":"Total zero. Another of those DARK DARK movies used to cover up the lack of a good clear plot and script. To long, to complex, to confusing, to many scenes with yet another fight where Batman lives. Try to ID the bad guys, it keeps changing. The scenes were all Black and white and to fast paced. Seems aimed only at the youth and pre-teen market who will think it is something new and spectacular because of the high sound volume and lots of useless killing. I tried to give a \\"0\\" rating but the system required at least 1 star which it does not deserve"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Crap - Batman is a loser!","review":"I liked the first one and thought the Joker was way too Psychotic and Batman was always 3 steps behind him and got his ASS Kicked!LOSER!"},{"rating":"1","title":"return the dark knight","review":"This product was not new as advertised. The front cover had a bunch of indentations on it and plastic pieces were broken so the case wouldn't even close. Also missing carboard case w/ Batman on the bike which it would have if product was really new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible apologia for the Iraq war","review":"The reason this gets a second star is that Heath Ledger is, of course, just as good as Heath Ledger was, and there are other very fine performances, not to mention beautiful design etc - a beautifully made movie. There's only one problem: it's evil. It's a senseless, cynical effort to rationalize and moralize senseless, cynical violence, with very direct suggestions that dehumanization and cruelty are the only possible responses to terrorism, that acts of violence by others leave us no choice.I love a lot of violent spectacles and movies that dish up their share of sexism etc., but this one was no fun - it was creepy and depressing and weirdly didactic, and I felt betrayed walking out of the theater, like I'd be tricked out of a bit of my soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Joke's On Us","review":"Heath Ledger works feverishly as the Joker (the intensity of his commitment is the best thing about his performance), and there are times when his black-ringed eyes take on a hurt expression, like a wounded raccoon's, that is unexpectedly touching. For the most part, however, Ledger turns a fantastical character into an ordinary, coarse-grained psychopath; and his Joker is neither original, inventive nor scary enough to be a truly memorable screen creation.The rest of the film is an insulting mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Movie Ever!","review":"One of the best movies in the history of the world! Don't let anyone convince you otherwise!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More Hollywood BS","review":"With the exception of the great acting by Heath Ledger, this film was another Hollywood predictable yawner. I couldn't wait for the movie to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a pile of crap","review":"Just proves yet again how the right amount of hype can propel a movie to new record heights, remember a dreadful movie called Titanic and the current Billion dollar mess Avatar.I guess like anything , might as well rent it for 99 cents from Redbox, but don't waste anymore money on this Donkey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check your brains at the door.","review":"After the 3rd attempt at trying to watched this movie I finally didn't fall alseep and watched the complete movie, now I wished I did fall asleep like the first two times. What a waste of time. How the hell did the Joker planned all these plots, plans, bombs, killings while Batman compliants that he can't find him. This movie is a \\"joke\\". And the joke is on us. This is a mindless piece of junk that you have to suspend all intelligence and logic to actually endured it. I was so bore then so angry that i just had to write this review to blow off some steam. Batman Begins was great, It's so sad that this movie didn't continue the greatness of that film. If you didn't see the movie yet, stay far away but it's probably too late."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Batman","review":"Other than Bale's ridiculous faux metal Batman voice, this is--in my opinion--the best Batman and the best comic book movie ever. The music is incredible and Ledger's Joker is outstanding. There will never be another performance in any comic book movie that'll ever top what he did with that character. It's one of the few characters in a movie that I think truly overlapped the actor, making you forget that it's not just THE JOKER on the screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark Knight..Dreary Night","review":"I would have given this 1 star but I appreciate the production values, so it gets a big 2.If you like \\"downer\\" movies, then this is the film for you.Without going into specifics, liekable characters are killed, a psychotic murderer/terrorist wreaks death and havoc and gets away with it all, and our hero is chastised and forced into exile because he was politically incorrect in his surveillance methods to try and save the lives of countless Gothamites.Next to the dreadful QUANTUM OF SOLACE travesty, the 2nd most dissappointing film of the year. Still, check it out if you haven't seen it, and judge for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"this crap is overhyped...","review":"when i first found that there is a new batman movie coming out, i was excited. bt was very disappointed halfway throughout the movie. they hype abt ledger's performances. no offence to heath, but there's nothing great abt his performance. it was just good, not great. i dont think the movie would get so much hype if heath is still alive seriously. and christian bale, probably the worst batman of all. other than that, the movie is just too boring. too much talking, lack of action. still love the old batman with michael keaton and tim burton."},{"rating":"1","title":"Real Snoozer","review":"Oh my god.I'd rather sit at the dentist & have my teeth pulled without novacaine rather than sit thru that snoozer again.

Everything is so one-dimensional: the characters, the plot, the look. It is relentlessly and mindlessly violent. It seems to have only one emotion to express and that is one of rage. It is like an orchestral arrangement where every instrument is playing on every beat of every measure. My Batman comics from the '60s display greater dynamics in emotion and execution. And since they were written for your average ten-year-old, what type of mentality is a film like this supposed to reach?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in the film, in any version.","review":"The amount of violence in this film is disturbing for anyone, let alone the PG-13 designation. I expected comic book violence in the film, but I was appalled at the mass destruction and menace that smacks of terrorism, and haven't we had enough of that? Is this what the creator of Batman intended?Moreover, while the plot of choosing good over evil is admirable, Ifeel that the sub-plot of masking good as evil for the sake of theorder, is manipulative and dishonest. Sure it's a good ploy for settingup future Batman films, but it's merely setting the stage for more ofthe same old stuff. How much violence and bad-boy heroes do we really needto be entertained?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long, too dark, too much Joker, interminable","review":"If you are not related to somebody in this movie and don't feel compelled to see every single Batman movie, I do not know why you would subject yourself to this. The Joker is memorable, but I don't want this in my memory. The only actors who I could understand were the Joker (who has about an hour of vamping over the course of the movie. Creepy, yes, but way too much.), the district attorney, Rachel, Batman's valet and tech guy. Other protagonists -- like Batman -- I could not understand what they were saying most of the time. So the dark movie did not make much sense. Dunno or care if it was how the actors spoke or how they were miked or mixed. Maybe if I could understand them I would have cared more. But I doubt it. Seemed like no plot, just \\"this happened, then this happened, then this happened...\\" for over two hours. I was very glad when it was over. I would never, ever sit through a minute of it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Boring Knight","review":"I'm watching the end of the movie as I write this review. Too long. No characters to really like or care for. Too violent. Too cruel. Extremely thin plot (like all Batman movies). Ridiculous body count. Even with my surround sound and 1080p upconverting Sony DVD player, it can't be saved. Nice special effects, but those don't make a movie. If Ledger hadn't died tragically prior to the release, many of the reviews and ratings would likely be less kind. 'nuff said.Other reviews say this is the best Batman movie to date.

It has no soul. It revels in violence and the most gut-wrenching cruelty without offering a single ray of hope. What is the point? Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker is superb - but it is easy to see how it could leave a person deeply disturbed. I have no problem with violent movies - Tarantino, Peckinpah, no problem.

Seeing it at the IMAX was one of my most fondest summer memories and still is. I made a vow to buy the movie when it got released......and I did. As much as I love having it on DVD, I was VERY let down by the DVD. The \\"Sounds of Anarchy\\" feature was interesting but it was just about the song \\"Why So Serious?\\", a suite that's 2 notes and runs 9 minutes long. I didn't want to see about like 5 minutes of a cellist playing 2 notes. The batsuit thingy was interesting but way too short. It's nice to have the IMAX scenes, but can't we watch them WITH the movie???? And the Gotham City newscasts... *snore*. Boring!!!So overall, DO buy the movie if you want the movie on DVD, but choose your poison carefully- get the one disc instead. You'll be happier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great flick, good (but not perfect) DVD","review":"Many others have already discussed the film, and like most of them, I really enjoy this picture. Ledger's performance as the Joker is completely absorbing. If anything, the Joker is \\"too\\" good in that Batman comes off as relatively dull and reactionary in comparison. Anyway, I do have one little complaint about this DVD: there's no two-channel mix, for us luddites that still don't have 5.1 gear. My DVD player and/or old stereo gear didn't seem to handle the 5.1 soundtrack very well. At times dialogue sounded a bit strange, although still audible. And I think my player's downmixing of 5.1 also affects the musical score. Anyway, if DVD producers are listening, please include 2-channel mixes for those of us without optimal home theater gear. That was pretty much a standard thing on DVDs for a number of years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just one small criticism...","review":"Just one thing bugs about this movie: The \\"super scary\\" Batman voice employed in Batman Begins during the \\"everybody is freaking out because of scarecrow's gas\\" scenes is now the standard batman voice throughout the sequel.It's too over the top and makes Bale's performance the least enjoyable of the big 3 in this film.Other than that this film rocks"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dark Knight Review","review":"I love the story very close to the comic book. I like the price I paid for it. It is a good buy.Blu-ray is the way to see this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Digital Copy Expired","review":"I bought this DVD from Amazon because it stated that there was a digital copy. My son wanted the digital copy for his Ipod. When I received it, there is no digital copy. The digital copy expired on 12/9/09 and I received it today 12/15/09. My plans were to give this DVD to my son as part of his Christmas. I am disappointed about the expiration of the digital copy. This should have not been put in the fine print at the end of the description. Instead it should have been placed at the top for people to plainly see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite below my expectations! Yet, I loved the Joker character very much!","review":"The movie was full of action. The joker was great, performed by Heath Ledger (may his soul rest in peace), however here are my remarks about the movie:- Continuous action for 2:20 hours made the movie boring instead of exciting- Dark theme, extremely dark. The movie becomes depressing after a while- The joker being extremely evil, deserved a worse ending instead of simply being handed to the cops- The soundtrack was poor- Batman in the end is shown to the public as the villain and gets chased by police dogs!!!!! What a horrible and poor way to end a batman movieHowever, I got to say the best thing about this movie was the joker. The dark knight wasn't about batman but about the joker. He was so bad, evil, sick, and dead smart. His tactics and plans were amazing, I got to salute him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie of the year !!!!","review":"GREATEST movie in a looooooong time.

R.I.P Heath Ledger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Knight Digital copy","review":"The film gets 4.9 stars in my opinion (there are a few things I could nit-pick, but I won't), it is one of the best comic-adaptations ever, and the DVD has all that I would want plus the digital copy.I generally don't watch bonus features on DVD's, nor do I buy DVD's for the bonus features. However, in this case the digital copy was worth the money. You can have a (legal) easy-to-obtain copy for windows media or for iPod/iPhone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Looks great, works, and is for sale at great price.

Ledger's joker is simply amazing, so dark and twisted. unfortunately, we lost a good actor in the process."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very dark! Hence the title.","review":"I liked this film and regret that it's filming contributed to the death of Heath Ledger. While many prefer the original Nicholson Joker's TV-series-esque madcap behavior, Mr. Ledger turned in a solid performance of the Killing Joke, Joker. Arguably the best and most terrifying Joker of them all.All this has been said before, but it bears repeating: the cast, direction, and script are all aces. A great snapshot of Batman's true sacrifice and heroism."},{"rating":"2","title":"remake of the original","review":"this is a remake of the original with new toys and a more evil and crazy Joker that thinks every one is capable of murder"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dark Knight","review":"You will not be disappointed with this movie.

Terrible foray into the blu ray market. This is a FAN MOVIE!!!! How the studio failed to figure this out when they designed the special features eludes me. I mean are stupid people running the show?! If you just want to see the movie in high def well you got to buy it. But when you find out that some producer spent all the special features budget on some six episodes of fictional seventh grader level banter to no end and you cant stand to watch any more, prepare for disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ray's movie","review":"It was a gift for my grandson, the movie was great worthy it's five stars.

It incorporates tons of action and is complemented by compelling dialogue."},{"rating":"2","title":"best b-man to date","review":"While there are weird flaws in this film, it is still the best comic book adaptation to date. There is all the action and great dialogue you could want... Joker in particular has some stellar speaches (unstoppable force meets immovable object), plus outstanding action (car chases, and thuggery) If you are a just fan of big cinematic shots or been to Chicago it is worth the purchase. Lots of great shots of lower wacker, lasalle and the daley bldg. Heath Ledger's last film completed is enough reason to buy this, but hey, if your a skeptic, the free digital copy will convince you. Buy it for someowne else, enjoy the digi copy. Even the skeptics like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best in the franchise","review":"The best of the Batman movies to date and while Christian Bales Batman is not as good as Keaton's or Kilmer's it was better than Cloonies Heath Ledger was good as the Joker he was semi spot on I say that because there's no way to really do the Joker faithfully without getting an R ratting although they really pushed it with a PG13."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dark Knight (Full-Screen Single-Disc Edition)","review":"My favorite movie EVER!!! & the best joker EVER! I could watch this over and over again.."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dark Knight","review":"It is gripping. An adult film, not for little ones. The two main characters play off each other well. The Joker is more life like and less comic book than the one as Jack Nicholson played it. Both were great, but played entirely from a different point of view. Bat Man was also more real world with technology at his disposal to do things mere mortals could not. Overall very good entertainment. I will not spoil the ending!"},{"rating":"2","title":"5 star what more can i say","review":"Yeah, thought I was buying a blue ray but its ok... still worth 5 star..

The slipcover really only functions when the journal and movie remain inside together, so unless you plan to keep your copy of Batman Begins inside as well, it will collapse if stacked with other movies.The journal is just that, an empty journal you can write in. The sleeve in the back has a nice surprise for hardcore fans of the movie. As of December '08, you may still be able to find this available at your local Blockbusters for a little over/under 35$, so don't pay over a hundred on Amazon yet!

What a let down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame Long And Boring","review":"I don't care what anyone says this movie was garbage. I can tell right off the back this was going to suck. The first thing i noticed was the first scene where the joker robs the bank, this one part it was so fake looking. Another thing that annoyed me was batmans voice, Why did they make his voice sound like that. The fight scenes was lame as hell the joker was lame and they did not need to put two face in this movie. They could have saved two face for a new movie. ALL the people who gave this movie 4 stars or 5 stars are just lying because they spent their money at movies ha ha or bought this garbage. Oh yea one more thing this movie was TOO DANG ON LONG matter fact i fast forwarded doing some of the movie. Overall I found the Batman that came out in 1989 and Batman Returns better than this. And by the way I not pay for this I recorded this off the I think the starz channel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most overrated movie ever made.","review":"This and Citizen Kane are the two most overrated films ever made.

The studios are really getting lazy and putting out trash. For this reason alone I cannot take Blu-ray seriously. Until we start really utilizing the technology this format is a lost. I'd expect at least a DTS ES 6 channels or ideally full 7 channel HD audio. For this reason I would suggest people boycott buying these HD formats simply because the studios and Sony are ripping people off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saw V","review":"The Dark Knight is a long, boring ripoff of the Saw movies. The joker in this movie is basically Jigsaw, omnipotent, with a sick need for sadism and torture. Just look at the scene where the guy had the cell phone stitched into his abdomen. We've seen that before. The story was convoluted and uninteresting. I couldn't wait for the movie to end. I still haven't figured out what so many people find interesting about this film. It is sick, pointless, and soulless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heath Good - Movie Bad","review":"Everyone was getting up throughout this movie -- no one seemed to care except when Ledger was on screen, and I've got to agree. The movie, IMHO, stunk. Everyone around me was yawning like mad, as was I.Where is Tim Burton when we need him? The director of this film must have been on vacation during shooting. The charater development was dull and flat - as was most of the acting. There was no one to care about. And for special effects is there anyting we haven't seen a million times already?This film in one word -- Bore - Bore - Boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somebody Saw Me Coming","review":"Love the movie, hate that I blew $15 on this DVD.

I fully expected to get a normally packaged BD along with a nice collectible. Not at all so. I had to destroy any collectible value the item had to see the film. Since there is no BD case to speak of, the whole thing just sits atop a 7' bookcase becoming something else to dust. I prefer to keep it out of sight since it is so cheap. Oh well.Like others who rated this item ONE STAR, I'm only trying to help future buyers to be informed before they make their purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Special features???","review":"I spent the extra $6 to get the two disc special edition, hoping there would be some good features.

The content of this movie includes very violent stuff; among others, torture and serial murder. It's s serious departure from previous Batman films, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The problem is that this movie should be rated R (period).

This film turns him into a liar and a conspirator. That just ruins it for me. (When does the film about Ghandi come out shwoing him as an axe murderer?) Forget this film - if you haven't seen it DON'T. This is just another \\"Battlestar Frackedenema\\" - a complete an total destruction of the original for some sort of genereation-why drug trip of a re-write. Nope I cannot recommend this to anyone unless you like the remake of Battlestar Galactica and \\"Star Trek\\" (the recent feature film by that title) where they completely destroy everthing that made it good in the first place. Forget this as it makes Batman no better than the criminals that he is hunting. Thanks to the producers of this film for ruining the last of my childhood heroes.

Deffinately a keeper. And the seller sent it to me right away."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Sparks in Gotham","review":"Overall, a strong film. Heath Ledger steals every scene he's in, and at times, Batman seems superfluous, the boring back side of the Joker's coin. A lot of the scenes are cut quickly; one might argue that this was intentional, a visual representation of the anarchy in the plot, but it becomes tiring. The biggest issue, though, was Maggie Gyllenhaal, who seems to be too haggard and unhappy for there to be a point in Bruce Wayne loving her. She attempts a 'sexy' delivery for a few lines, and it doesn't work. Say what you will about Katie Holmes, her performance in \\"Batman Begins\\" was steely; Gyllenhaal doesn't have the same balls."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST MOVIE HEATH WAS IN!","review":"Its beyond words esspecially on blu ray. The joker isn't just a lunatic in makeup, he makes you think about his way of life (well 4 me!) Every scene he was in i got shivers.

Also this was supposed to arrive on the 10th of decmber it didn't arrive till the 13th, it was only days but 3 days i had to wait longer so the shipping absolutley deserves negative stars just like the special features. But once again do get the one disk edition of the movie because the movie itself is amazing and if i was rating the movie not the product it would have 5 stars not one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible video mastering!!","review":"Everything you've heard about how bad the \\"standard definition\\" DVD looks is all too true. I rented DK before purchasing it, and couldn't believe how grainy and filled with artifacts it was! This with an Oppo 983H upscaling player -- the best in the business. Even at 16 feet away, I could see the horrible quality defects on my 46\\" Samsung LCD.I firmly believe the studio released this DVD poorly mastered with the full intent of making the blu-ray version look far superior. This hasn't been the case with countless other \\"standard\\" DVDs. A sleazy marketing ploy. Avoid this one like the plague!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie. Horrible DRM","review":"If you are thinking about buying the special addition for the \\"Digital Copy\\" you need to know Warner Brothers are lying to you.I ripped the digital copy to my XP machine. Transferred it to my Vista machine to stream to my 360. Apparently somewhere in that simple transaction, WB decided to DEACTIVATE the digital copy making it completely useless. Who are they kidding?Way to go DRM. I'm getting a refund. Save yourself some money and find this movie through other means."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design","review":"The Blu-ray discs are stored in the slim case which is placed by the Batpod. If you want to put your Batpod on your desk or in a display cabinet, the discs will not be sitting with your movie collection. This is my main gripe because I like all my movies in one place. The DVD which contains Digital Copy comes in a sleeve. In short you don't get any typical Blu-ray/DVD case.The Batpod itself is a bit small, and looks like typical Chinese workmanship. If you really want a Batpod, I would suggest buying the normal Blu-ray version that comes in Blu-ray's blue case, and get a bigger, quality Batpod from else where.The movie is a solid 5 star."},{"rating":"2","title":"anyone giving this film less than 5 stars obviously doesn't know what a good movie is!","review":"I saw this movie, and was simply blown away. I have never been more into a movie than this one. Perfect cast, fantastic acting, intresting in almost all aspects. This is probaly my favorite movie of the year, but the only other one that rivals it is eagle eye (which i highly recomend to any fans of action movies). It's a real toss up, but they're both so good in different ways. I'm gonna have to give 1st place to The Dark Knight.If you haven't seen this film, you haven't lived life to the fullest, go and watch it right now!Now you've read this, so go!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah but...","review":"Virtually everyone who's opinion I usually can trust just loved this movie last summer, but I couldn't get interested enough to go see it. However, when the Dark Knight came out on DVD, I bought it the day it came out and still... I never watched it until this week.So... I watched it and it was good, but I found it so dark and brooding that for me, it less than pleasant even while being amazed at the visual experience, and awed by some of the performances.So, if you are a Batman fan you will love it, if not..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks to all early reviewers of this 2-disc \\"SPECIAL\\" edition","review":"Love this movie and will get it when the real \\"special edition\\"comes out!Completely pissed off just knowing blue ray gotted more special features...

Too bad Ledger died since he will be difficult to replace in the next installment.Great special effects for Harvey Dent (Two-Face)! I was sorry that Michael Caine's role is diminished from the first movie as he really shines when he is on screen. Look for the Scarecrow's return at the very beginning of the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get it!","review":"Love this movie. The video and sound are amazing. Have a 46inch Samsung with 5.1 surround...this movie really draws you in."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very memorable movie","review":"After three years, the darkness returns with a splash. It is even darker than ever. This movie doesn't bring any disappointment. It is a truly memorable movie in all. For the story, it is very good with loads of excitement like how the Joker will make Gotham City in a total mess and destroy the romance relationship between Harvey and Rachel. For the acting, Christian Bale once again proves himself that he can be suitable to play the role of Batman/Bruce Wayne. For Heath Ledger as the Joker, he plays good too. For the direction, it is good. For the visuals, it is absolutely perfect with no doubts. Compare with the other movies, this is the best among all Batman series."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Darkest Knight","review":"A marvelous movie, and in addition, my class viewed the movie in conjunction with our world literature course called Human Beings: Heroes or Beasts."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dark Knight","review":"This was a good movie. Heath Ledger did put his spin on the joker. I was surprised about the change of MS. Daws but I can't complain she did a good job too. I believe that Batman Begins was the better movie though. Dark Knight did not seem to have as much action in it. I do recommend watching the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comic book characters... making millions of horrible movies these days","review":"You people these days consider this a good movie? Haha. Who in their right mind believes that a bat character that drives a Pontiac Firebird clone can save the world from evil?For good and REAL action check out WWE, ECW, or TNA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark and Full of Suspense","review":"I was never really into Batman, but I loved this movie. I actually think that it was the villain, the Joker, that made me fall in love with it. He is just so evil that people have to love him. I found that Batman was kind of dark and not as cool as I was hoping him to be. I was disappointed with the ending of the movie, I will not say what it is so not to ruin it. But I wished it was a happy one. I think it hindered the movie. But the Joker saved the whole thing in my opinion. The whole thing is just a cat and mouse chase that's suspenseful."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy used dvd","review":"I purchased this used dvd movie which was claimed to be \\"used, very good\\".

You'd honestly get more by doing a search for Batman stuff online. I'm not too concerned with the comic book aspect, though it IS interesting. I want to know more about the movie and how it was all put together.I'd been hesitant to see this movie mainly because of the hype with Keith Legend dying of an OD. I waited for it to come out on DVD, and am sorry I missed it in theaters. The plot is great, really keeping your eyes glued to the screen! And Keith Legend's portrayal of the Joker is the best I've ever seen, certainly better thanJack Nicholas!! I really love Christian Bale as Batman. He was great inBatman Begins.I won't go into too much about the plot, as others have exhausted themselves doing. It's a great movie and you won't regret it! I'd recommend renting it for now and waiting to buy any special edition until a much better one comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Film, but DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE TWO DISC SPECIAL EDITION!","review":"I am not going to waste time talking about the film, as people looking at buying this have already seen it.The two disc is a total waste of money. All you get on the bonus disc are a digital copy of the film(which you don't need if you have ripping software), and really stupid bits about how the composer waited to adapt the film to Heath Ledger's acting(seriously?), a documentary of the making of the new Batman suit(I DON'T CARE), and an especially stupid set of fake CNN clips where \\"pundits\\" discuss current events happening in the film(really poorly thought out farce). Had I known this is what I would be getting for the extra money, I would NEVER have bought it.WASTE OF MONEY!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I would play a gambit with that *knight*","review":"The film, which is somehow hailed by the majority of critics, is a humorless, gruesome mess, which is painful to watch. It is brimming with pseudo-artistry of tricks and callow gadgetry. This is the problem with our Hyper-real reality - each new installation will be a copy of a copy - the further plagiarized original. Where is the humor of the original *Batman* (1989)? Where is the chemistry between Kim Basinger and Michael Keaton, the authenticity of Alfred?Where, I ask you, is Jack Nicholson's perfect gravitas and Joker's playful script conceived and executed with such agile perfection? Where is the artistic imagery of Gotham and subtle quality of the tracking shots and music score? Compared to the original *Batman*, this is a blotted unimaginative mess, guaranteed to cause a mild indigestion because of its unripe ideas and the glorified violence, which the film itself was supposed to scrutinize."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like this movie","review":"I personally did not like this movie at all, but my boyfriend loved it and I know a ton of people love it so much, that it just won many awards at the People Choice Awards 2009, and one of them including \\"best movie\\". I watched about an hour of it and couldn't watch it anymore cause I didn't like it and didn't seem interesting. A lot of parts in it you can tell are super fake. However, Heath Ledger did an amazing job in this movie. That is the only thing I like about this movie. Sorry. From me to you, I would probably get it since most people love the movie, but I just didn't like it for some reason. And I love most movies like this, yet I never have liked ANY batman movies ever. You make the decision. If you like prior batmans, then you will like it, but if not, then dont waste your time, unless you want to see how Heath Ledger plays an absolutely crazy part in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insomniacs of the world unite!","review":"If you suffer from insomnia - this might work for you. Complicated (needlessly for a comic book story). Desperately seeking meaning in a tired old franchise. Of course I have great respect for Chris Nolan, but this movie sucks. I never was a Heath Ledger fan, but his is a good performance and thus a silver lining in this cloud of a film. Way too long (are there no editors in Hollywood anymore?). I don't want to have to sit and concentrate over a Batman film. Boo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a bad joke.","review":"One would expect something better from this movie. After all, the cast is impressive and other episodes have done fairly well. Yet, the movie and its actors manage to be bad where there was no room to fail. If you still want to see it, rent it: it would be cheaper and the disappointment bearable."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE WASTE OF TIME!","review":"This awful movie is cliche ridden and contrived like any other adventure movie and so much so that I only watched the 1st 40 minutes: It has camera angles that are dizzily swirling around and music that is over exaggerated at tense moments. The 1st Batman Begins movie was way better. Don't waste your time with this dog!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Explosive.","review":"I guess I was looking for a little bit more. I was led to believe that, at some point in the 3 hours, Batman and The Joker would have a brief but interesting exchange about being two sides of the same coin--the nature of good and evil thing. I think they tried to work this in but, since The Joker is a lunatic, he couldn't make the case, \\"You're just like me\\". (See the movie Heat, where arch-villain DeNiro has coffee with good-guy cop Pacino, and the idea is, they're both professionals who shoot people...very interesting).Ok, so nothing that \\"deep\\". But I don't argue that the explosions were bigger; the sense of hopelessness, greater. Just what we need right now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissappointed","review":"I purchased this product - It was not clear to me from the description but, you can't view it with dvd player you have to have blue ray - It is useless to me I do not have a blue ray player - Now it is just junk!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you love this film, your standards are very low","review":"All of Nolan's previous films are tangled messes (Memento, Insomnia, Inception). In seeking to create a slightly coherent film he has ruined all of the quirkiness and fantastically weird unorthodoxy of what has made Batman a loved and unique character in print and on screen. The irony is that if Nolan had used his prior directorial and writing techniques in creating this trio of Batman films, they would have been much more aesthetically and intellectually captivating: simply, better.The best part of this film was the few seconds long scene when The Joker sticks his head out of the police car window. For that scene, and for that scene only, this film gets one star."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST MOVIE OF 2008!!!","review":"This is a must own Bluray!

Finally, someone knows how to make a damn good superhero movie.\\" And then when I heard about a sequel (in which I am not surprised given the box office hit of the first) and hoped that it does not dissapoint the first movie. Lo and behold, it did not. For me, the sequel/Dark Knight is better than its predecessor. I told my wife again, \\"Now THIS is how they should make sequels, it's that damn good!\\" Heath's performance is outstanding. He brings the Joker's character to a whole new level. The storyline is great, everything is great. That is why there is no doubt that the Blu Ray/DVD sale of this movie will definitely surpass Iron Man. This movie is a must have, especially for hidef fanatics like me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I Expected","review":"This is definitely not a family movie. PG-13 is a joke. The amount of violence is overbearing for younger audiences.After watching Iron Man, the Dark Knight didn't compare. You'll be disappointed. Wait a while a looking for something better.This movie doesn't do Batman justice. There have been so many better Batman movies that this one puts an arrow through your heart. Michael Caine must have needed to money to play in the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the Burton Batmans","review":"While the \\"becoming Batman\\" parts of \\"Batman Begins\\" were a welcome addition to the Batman canon, this one pales in comparison to the Tim Burton Batmans. Burton's had much more character development, and a lesser body count. The Burton ones cinematography and set were much more \\"other worldly\\" and interesting. While this one had better technology, the effects got to be headache-inducing in it's overlong 2 1/2 hours. I also prefer Michael Keaton/Jack Nicholson to Bale/Ledger, and the Danny Elfman score for the Burton movies was preferable of course.While they are huge box office hits, I really wish Hollywood would stop regurgitating Batmans/Hulks/etc. with better effects but less nuance, and writing something original!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Great movie, definitely worth the money. Finally the real batman movie, this one has met all of the standards of the comic. Excellent acting and a wonderful movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complex Comic Book Movie","review":"The Dark Knight is definitely not for small children, but grownups who enjoy Batman and appreciate a different dark moody feel. For some reason Robin was not in the movie, but a lonely lovelorn Batman beset by tragedy.Batman (Christian Bale), upsets the Gotham City Mob. There is also a new D.A., HaRvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), with blond hair and blue eyes and idealistic view on fighting crime.The Joker (Heath Ledger) appears and wants the Gotham City criminals to work with him and kill Batman. Ledger does a fantastic performance as the Joker and provides some wry jokes as he devils his victims. However, he is also frightening and hard to catch - one step in front of the Police. Maggie Gyllenhaal plays the role of Rachel Dawes and Dent and Batman both love her. There are plenty of action sequences and the special effects - especially Dent's face after an accident - are well done. The film is dark but the artistic sets and cinema is excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing lack of extras","review":"The film is photographed sublimely and Heath Ledger's performance is great but I'm disappointed in the lack of extras. There is not a single commentary track and only limited behind the scenes footage and information. There are two 45 minute worthless documentaries on Batman's technology and psychology which play like promo pieces rather than substantial extras, and then there are some pop up 'making of' extras that you can activate to watch during the film or separately. But each clip is only a few minutes so there is actually very little 'making of' or behind the scenes features at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a tad too long","review":"Very good movie. Christian Bale is the best Batman and Heath Ledger played an awesome Joker. I would see the movie again and will likely get it on DVD for the family, but in my opinion, it was a bit too long. They could have easily taken 30 minutes of fluff out of the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dark Knight","review":"This movie is great! Heath Ledger's performance in this film is memorable. Everyone is great, except for poor Maggie Gylenhall. Aaron Eckhart is amazing as well. Not too many extra features but that is why I bought the single-disc version, no fuss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unforgettable acting by Heath Ledger","review":"Any time a legend like Jack Nicholson plays a character, it's tough to follow in those footsteps, to match the performance of a master and legend.Heath Ledger's performance as The Joker was so over-the-top amazing that it made me forget that Nicholson ever played the part. I wasn't especially a fan of his until this movie, which I re-watch often. If you haven't seen it (and why not?), it is worth watching simply for scenes in which The Joker holds court. And he pretty much drives and dominates every scene he's in.He made a good movie into a great, classic one.

ALSO-I would caution buyers to read carefully what the \\"+BD Live\\" means. I skimmed reading that part too much thinking it was some downloadable digital copy along with the physical blu-ray disk - that's not the case.

Basically, this band rode the hype created by power trios such as Cream and Hendrix. As opposed to those two bands, this band plods along from the opening set to the dull, boring, leaden last cut with its clunky exchange between Mark Farner and Mel Schacher, to the lifeless backbeat by Brewer. Mark Farner's playing is easily imitable by dozens oflocal garage bands, he seems to revel in cutting virtually every solo from the E-minor chord. Best player is Don Brewer, the drummer, but his pyrotechnic drumming is no complement to the soulless noise one suffers through on this record.If you must get this reissue CD, be forewarned- unless you really like these obnoxious louts."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"Having spent some time in Germany and being familiar with Merkur products, I was very much disappointed with the quality of this razor.

But if you read as much as I do, then it won't bother you to return to an author you can trust every now and then to read about your favorite leading ladies and gentlemen with new names, in a new lusty adventure."},{"rating":"1","title":"not her best","review":"I agree this is one of her worst books, but I love most of her older books and am looking forward to future books.

No thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK!","review":"This was my first book i ever read that Susan Johnson had every wrote. And it will probably be my last! I literally only got to about 30, 40 pages before i stopped! I felt like Beatrix was acting the like a whore. I skimmed through the rest of the book, and was disgusted. Jumping in bed with other men and her continous love making with Pashsa even though she didn't love him then. If you read it, you would understand what i mean. It's a disgusting and not even a romance story. It's more of an erotic story with a big plot. I recommend Catherine Coulter! She's a magnificent romance writer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Has Susan Johnson forgotten how to write a good story?","review":"The story is a mess and there is no good characterisation of Trixi and Pasha at all!

It is the second one that I have read and it most certainly pales in comparison to the first book I read by her \\"Golden Paradise\\". Of all the reviews that I have read, no one seems to have mentioned this particular book, and I wonder why. It is one of the best books that I have ever read. It is full of intrigue, passion and love between Stephan and Lisaveta. I recommend that fans of Susan Johnson read \\"Golden Paradise\\" instead of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"infuriatingly excellant CD","review":"This CD is, as Jerry Pournelle used to write in Byte magazine,infuriatingly excellant.

My son really loves Tom and Jerry so when I got this for him he loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Good Introduction to Syntax","review":"This was a very disappointing book. It was used as a textbook for an undergraduate Syntactic Theory course that I took, and I just did not find it to be very understandable. There weren't enough examples of structure, and the examples that were there were often not adequately explained. Theories were not clearly distinguished, and several theories were presented at once, making it difficult to tell them apart. Some of the material was very good, especially the parts on phrase structure rules and syntactic categories. Everything after chapter 5, however, made little sense and was just too thick and murky to wade through. The sections on anaphora, passives, raising, and control were very difficult to understand. Keep in mind that this is coming from a beginner's perspective, and perhaps people with more of a background in syntax will have a much better time with it. However, as an introduction to syntactic theories and concepts it was not a very helpful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Album","review":"Album: Cuentos Del Mundo Hispanico (comes with CDs) (Spanish Edition)Me gusta este libro porque la majoridad de los cuentos son muy cortos y no son tan dificil de traducir.The CD has different readers, each with the accent of the country of the story.

It is the one electric appliance I keep out all the time. Great for making gravy, smoothies, and mixing sauces. The chopper attachment works great for onion, garlic, peppers, etc. You can chop to puree, depending on how long you hold the button. Very durable, versatile, and easy to clean! After having one you won't want to go without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This stick blender is awesome","review":"This stick blender is AWESOME. I use it for everything. I puree soups right in the pot without the mess of transferring to a food processor. We make smoothies in the large cup that comes with it, which fits the stick blender perfectly. And even though I wasn't really interested in having it, I use the included blender-looking attachment all the time. In fact, the 400 watt motor makes it a lot more powerful than our \\"real\\" blender. It makes mincemeat of ice and frozen berries. All parts except the motor are diswasher safe, which is great for cleanup. The other thing I love is the \\"turbo\\" mode - it's just so powerful, it zips through everything.I was about to buy a Cuisinart stick blender when I read a review that cautioned against it, and now I'm so glad I didn't. The Cuisinart one you can only use for 15 lousy seconds at a time so you don't damage the motor, AND you have to hand-wash the parts. Who needs that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best little tool in the kitchen!","review":"What an awsome hand blender! I've had mine for a year and never a problem. So cool how all the parts snap off and on. Made my favorite fudge recipe-Blended the boiling sugar and evaporated milk to the creamiest consistency ever without melting the base of the blender. The turbo makes sauces and soups a breeze. Wouldn't be without it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over priced","review":"This product although it performs well is not worth the money. Its older version at70.00 some dollars performs every bit as good. at that price you might as well buy a proffesional immersion blender with three times the powe.r and performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great multi-tasker","review":"I bought this because it was a powerful immersion blender. I already have a food processor and whisk beater so didn't expect to even use those features. I have used all of them a ton. The blender works just as it should- very powerful. The chopper works great and is so easy to pull out for little jobs like chopping one shallot or some herbs. The extras that come with it are great too. I whole heartedly recommend this product- easy to use, easy to clean, does a great job!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Twice the cost as 5 years ago for the same appliance","review":"I've had this blender since 2005, paid under $99 for it through Amazon. I love how it performs and was using it almost daily. Unfortunately, the small-jar chopping wand broke and I can't seem to find a replacement, either for the wand or the the entire the small-jar set-up. I was willing to replace the entire appliance, but not at twice the cost of the 2005 version. There has been no additional attachment/tool included in the set, so what could double the price? This is simply robbery... So, I'll just hold off until I can get a better deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mislead by Amazon....","review":"I've bought this items because of Brauns good reputation. They have also a smaller set for 20 dollars less. I went for this one, because it shows more attachments. Fact is it does not contain all the attachments shown. The one to the farthest right is not part of it. Bummer! I could have saved 20 bucks buying the other model. I will return this item for the other one.Also it said shipped and sold by amazon. Guess what it came from Macys and their return policy sucks.Be aware..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved it until the motor gave up","review":"I owned this little blender for 8 months and LOVED it, until I mashed cooked potatoes today and the motor blew out of the blue. There was no warning of overheating, straining on the motor etc. just a plop sound and the thing is broken. After having it loved for 8 months I am hugely disappointed and would not buy it again"},{"rating":"2","title":"best kitchen item i own!","review":"This is so handy in kitchen: quick to take to mix, chop, puree and so easy to clean. I use it mostly for doing baby food: it purees so easily all the fruits and veggies. This little plastic bowl in which the blender fits perfectly is best for that use. I also puree vegetable soups straight in the hot pots that i cook them in and it does great work and soups become so creamy!Only thing that there is a silicone seal right on the edge of the blender which was already coming out when i got the blender, but after i called Braun consumer service they sent me a replacement shaft straight away.I really recommed this product!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!!","review":"This is exactly what I was looking for: a professional quality immersion blender at an affordable price!

I love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I got the bad egg","review":"My boss had one of these that he let me borrow for a culinary competition. I have used many hand held blenders to include the cuisinart and kitchenaid versions which I own, but this blows them away. It is the only mini blender that I've seen that will actually fully puree carrots into a nice cohesive sauce (with the food processor attachment. The other brands left tiny granular chunks in it. I was actually quite impressed with the set and looking to buy one for myself until about the fourth time using it when the plastic above the blade attachment melted to the shaft of the food processor unit, transforming it into a piece of useless junk. He hadn't used it more than a dozen times, so wear and tear should not have been an issue. Regardless, I had to buy him a new one, and I therefore will never trust anything from Braun again despite the fact that this was clearly a fluke. I don't know if this has happened to anyone else with this product, but I'm not willing to take my chances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor gave out - disappointed","review":"We bought this product 3 years ago, and the warranty with Braun is just for 1 year. I used it pretty regularly and it was very efficient and useful. However, I am really disappointed that it broke after just 3 years. I called Braun and they said that I could take it to the local service center but would have to pay to get it fixed. Most blenders last at least 5 years before dying. Next time, I'm going to get a different brand and hopefully something that lasts longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"bullet proof - the BEST on the market","review":"I've used my blender twice, every day, for 5 years.

It was what I was hoping for."},{"rating":"1","title":"very old-fashioned","review":"you can really tell this book is from the seventies or sixties or whatever. its been a while since ive started reading it, therefore i dont remember exact phrases, but it has advice on not saying this or that to your child, and the examples are pretty extreme insults, something no one would say to their kids nowadays anyway. its like saying dont hit your children, when no one in their right minds does that anyway. it might have been new and valuable information 35 years ago, but its not anymore today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good info but light on correction","review":"I thought there was some good information but I think it was light on correction. While I believe that we need to create a loving, safe, and encouraging environment for our children I also believe that there are times when children defy authority and need to be corrected. This book tries to combat the problem before it happens by the way we communicate with them. Although communication is key to the Parent/child relationship, children need to know that the Parent is in charge, that they must obey the first time and without argument. Don't get me wrong, children are a beautiful blessing from God and they need to be nurtured so carefully. But along with that nurturing comes this demand for obedience because I am their authority. The book was light on parental authority and presented parents merely as guides in a child's life rather than an authority to be obeyed and to protect them. I think our society could use a bit more respect for authority."},{"rating":"2","title":"my eye opener","review":"This book helps me to understand my first daugher, 25 months old, and teach me how I should react properly~"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book changed my life","review":"I read this when my kids were young (they're now 33, 32 & 27) and I was a beginning teacher of middle school and high school students (just finished my 36th year). This plus Ginott's BETWEEN PARENT AND TEENAGER formed the basis of my philosophy of dealing with kids. If you read this in conjunction with other level-headed dealing-with-your-child books, you'll have a calmer time at home, an actual relationship with your kids, and, in my case, a more succesful work life. BTW, the other book that changed my life was CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical Useable Advice that actually Works!","review":"This book goes beyond vague theory and gives you practical advice. You can begin to use the ideas the day you start reading it. It works so well, as soon as I began using the Ginott suggestions I had many alternatives to the yelling and spanking I grew up with and didn't want to pass on to my kids. It broke the cycle of emotional and physical violence for this family."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favourite parenting book","review":"This book is a wonderful addition to any parents' library. I am a child psychiatrist who recommends it frequently to parents. It clearly discusses how important language is in our relationship with our children without being judgmental or preachy. It clearly outlines verbal patterns that many parents get into and helpful strategies to get out of those patterns. The premise is simple --- we need to listen more. However, if you are someone who recognizes this is easier said than done, I recommend reading this book. I get hundreds of books out of the library; there are few that I ultimately purchase. This was one of those few."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Parenting Book I've Read","review":"The whole premise of the book is that love and common sense are not enough to raise most children well. Good parenting skills need to be *learned*. This book gives terrific examples of good and not so good parenting with each topic it covers. I've read at least a dozen parenting books (I have a very \\"highly spirited\\" 9 year old boy) and this one has made a big difference for me in my parenting. The emphasis on validating children's feelings somehow resonated better with me with this book than others, I think because the authors are particularly gifted in presenting the child's perspective. Using just a couple of the techniques in the book, I have been able to keep my son's emotional outbursts to a minimum -- and therefore my own, too. Better for me, and clearly better for him! I understand him better now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the new edition.","review":"Some reasonable suggestions for handling kids, but alot of it is quite dated, particularly the advice on gender roles."},{"rating":"2","title":"a very good book but maybe a little too general","review":"I would have liked to read about more real life examples and solutions to the problems.

Not only are the sermons (preachy little 'stories' that pass for 'chapters') poorly written, but they're boring and full of first-writers' cliches.I was appalled to think that cross-country readers might form their impression of Minnesota based on this minister's experiences.

I was stoked to hear of the COMPLETE Capitol catolog re-release's. Secondly, I am happy with the CD's themselves, although I thought the idea of buying the trunk (Box set)was to get ALL of the CD's at once. My first dissappointment however was the lack of thought (coolness!) and 5 cent budget put into the trunk (cardboard box covered with colored paper & filled with 2 measly little useless trinkets in a special smaller box.) Remember the age group this band came from! If you are short of money, then I suggest \\"Thirty Years of Funk\\" box set, as a much better value. My second & biggest dissappointment is that no where in the 12 album (CD) reissue is the number one album of all time! Mark, Don & Mel 1969-1971 ! This is the ONLY CD REISSUE most of us even want. I played this album, 8-track, & cassette to death.

This book is a bad soap opera in print."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"I was recommended by a friend to read this book, and I am never, ever listening to her advice again! This was a terrible piece of \\"prose\\"! Shallow and poorly written, like a screenplay rejected from a bad soap opera pilot. Audrey, the protagonist, is a horribe wife, a horrible mother, and so lifeless and unreal that you want her to be slapped and locked up instantly!I couldn't finish the book, because with each chapter came more and more badly written storylines that failed to capture my attention. They did garner a lot of laughter from me and the other friends I've shown this piece of trash to.Save yourself the horror and read something else!

The main character is narcissistic, self-indulgent, and wholly unsympathetic. There was little character development. The dialogue was unrealistic. And the prose was frequently didactic in an inappropriate way for fiction. The writer's background in writing comic non-fiction permeates the text. At times I thought I was reading a piece from \\"Redbook.\\" And the abbreviated chapters suggest this was once a screenplay that the writer tried--and failed--to transform into literary fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overboard is a favorite","review":"I love this collection.

Although many people say that it was rehashed stuff, for many people today this book can offer a truly objective and well documented account of the true history of JFK's so called Camelot.

I am a big Kennedy fan and I did indeed hate it and my brother is a Kennedy basher and he hated it also! This book is in fact the first book I could not finish. I am not the optimistic day dream believer that Kennedy did no wrong and was a saint. I know he was a man with flaws and I accepted that fact. What I can NOT accept is the \\"facts\\" listed that can't even be proved OR disproved. It's like Hersh just wanted to keep beating a dead man who cant defend himself. Most history buffs say Kennedy was the BEST president, he did many great things for this country and I like to believe that had he lived he would have done so much more that would have improved this country even more. This book left me nauseous and feeling like I needed a bath in bleach to get the foulness off. I am ashamed I even bought this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our own century's answer to England's Charles II.","review":"Hersh's biography paints a portrait of John F. Kennedy that looks very much like diarist Samuel Pepys' sketches of the younger Charles Stewart, the hardheaded, brilliant, complex and promiscuous king who led Restoration England's version of Camelot in the late 1600s. It shows that viewing the guts of the political process, like the making of sausage, may not be pleasant for the squeamish. Which, frankly, is why I'm only an engineer, not a statesman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very thorough and well organized","review":"I was impressed with the way the author was able to present a large amount of complex information in a very concise and readable format. The subject itself is interesting and the author was able to substantiate the claims made by this book.

I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to look beyond the surface and get a more in depth understanding of the complex forces swirling around JFK during his time in office."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth passing up !!!","review":"I found the author repeating the same information over and over in different sections of the book. I'am more disappointed with myself for picking up the book than what the author wrote --- in another words, this is a good one to pass up."},{"rating":"1","title":"tabloid trash, fantasy","review":"If I could have given it 0 stars I would have...Seymour Hersh's book, has been roundly condemned by scholars and with good reason. Any journalist who would accept the now proven , faked Marilyn Monore papers, and reluctantly remove them from being published only days before going to press. Is someone who is wreckless with history,didn't check or care for authenticity (it was some one else who did at the last minute) and incredibly gullible (the other Kennedy papers were also faked, using typewriting equipment that hadn't been invented until many years after JFKs death!) And of course out to make a quick buck,the facts be damned. In the tabloid era, Hersh was hoping to score a hit...and instead, as Gary Wills said, \\" completely destroyed his own career and reputation.\\" The book was a flop,collapsing under it's own incredulity and is already verging on obscurity and we can hope to God that other such sensational books will follow the same path."},{"rating":"1","title":"What an Investigator!","review":"Amazing! The Church Committee couldn't find the connection between illegal anti-Castro activities and JFK...and Richard Nixon couldn't find the connection. But Seymour Hersh found it! What total nonsense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"I found this book to be utterly fascinating. As Hersh is a relatively well-known investigative reporter, I tend to trust what he says is true, although I have no way to verify any of it. Although others have commented that what he reveals isn't any news, I haven't read any other books about Kennedy, so it was all news to me. It seems to me that the earlier reviewers who have rejected his conclusions resent having their idol smashed to pieces. It's interesting how Kennedy's misdeeds and compulsions parallel those of the current president. Perhaps the only distinction is their family background."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expose' tour de force! No stone left unturned","review":"This book is one stunning fact after another taken from witness after witness. It shows clearly something we allready knew, the Kennedy famliy was made up of normal people who, due to access to money and power did outrageous things. The best part about this book is the way it helps to deconstruct the diety status we have placed on JFK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some people will believe anything","review":"It saddens me to see books like this being published. We have the Jerry Springer show, WWF wrestling and the National Enquirer, and books like this. PT Barnum said it best, \\"There is a sucker born every minute\\" and this book proves it! If books like \\"Elvis is Alive\\" can be published, and have people actually buy it, Then people will believe anything! The author of this book obviously knows that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review for The Dark Side Of Camelot","review":"As I read this book I got the feeling that it was a tabloid at worst and simply petty at best. The author clearly has an agenda and is out to discredit the president. I am saying this with no attachment to either party or to JFK whatsoever. The book is basically about JFKs affairs, his supposed ties to the mafia, the botched Bay of Pigs invasion, and a few others. It's basically a tearing down of JFK and his public persona. I found it rather parochial frankly."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Why the CIA Talks So Much to Seymour","review":"This book is a disgrace. It is the most uncritically piece of CIA propaganda ever written. Research for yourself the key source of Seymour's Samuel Halperin. This bookis basically written by the CIA.For a much better read based on thousands of new documents since Sys hatchet job, see the amazing JFK and the Unspeakable: Why He Died and Why It Matters by James W. Douglass. Daniel Ellsberg-- he of the Pentagon Papers-- said it fundamentally changed his view of the JFK and his assassination > CIA.JFK and the Unspeakable: Why He Died and Why It Matters"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great book to read to it also has alot information to.","review":"This book keeps you on your seat because it has alot information, suspense and alot of drama.

If these things really happened as Mr. Hersh and his so-called witnesses say they did, then it surely would have come out much sooner. It's really easy to kick a man that can't answer for himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prove it!","review":"It is a sad commentary that anyone can take a collection of unproven allegations and present it to the public like this without any evidence backing it, and some people still defend it by citing the book's own flawed and unsupported arguments.Two words; prove it.With all of the supposed orgies going on where are all the women who can now cash-in with their own stories? In a post-Clinton world what is to stop them, if it's true? 180 degrees from this piece of effluvia is The Kennedy Tapes, where they back up statements with transcripts from tapes made at the time. Yes, unlike the world that the tabloid historians live in, real historians have to (and do) back up their writing with research and documentation from credible sources. They prove it.This book isn't The Dark Side of Camelot, it's the Dark Side of Trash for Cash Journalism. I hope Mr. Hersh made enough money to justify the prostitution of his credibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another sourceless meal for vultures of gossip.","review":"Gossips, like vultures, like their meat rancid. Here's a perfect meal for the vacuous minds that sustain themselves on junk food like this. Hersh is a gossip with few real sources and no concern for journalistic integrity. Most of those who read this will ooh and aah about it like it was factual. A lazy mind deserves what it's fed. Enjoy your rancid meal."},{"rating":"2","title":"It had me shocked into disbelief","review":"I have always been facinated by the Kennedys but after reading this information about them has really opened my eyes. I knew of some of the information but to find out the others has really baffled me. Some of the information has really left me also thinking that alot of it sounded like two old women sitting on the back porch talking about the neighbor. If his research is as good as his writing and it is all true, camelot was bond to come to an end."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD READ","review":"Seymour is quite the story teller. The Presidency of Jack Kennedy is one of the most interesting stories of the 20th Century. What more could one possibly want: War, Sex, Drugs, desception, the mob, and assassination. The Kennedy Presidency reads more like Melrose Place (sans Allison), and Seymour Hersh does an excellent job of uncovering the truth behind Camelot. Hersh should be commended for his copious research, and she be applauded for his breezy story telling manner. Along with Roger Simon's new book, this is the best political book on the shelves. Other than Alley McBeal, I don't know where else you would find all the intrigue that the JFK presidency had. Must read tv for all."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is pure trash","review":"The only reason I didn't give this a rating of 1 is because this guy may write another book. I hate to think that this trashy book cost the lives of perfectly good trees. The only value to be realized from this will come from the fact that it is biodegradable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and informative book with one weakness","review":"A very good read , very honest and compelling . I can only recommend the book to all the people who wants to know the whole story . I'm fascinated by the Kennedy family , and I was glad to got the book .However , I have to subtract one star , because the author perpetrated the myth and the fairy tale of the lonegunman .With all what we know today , this is an offense for the intelligent mind . Otherwise the book is absolutely great ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Were you alive in 1962?","review":"Were you alive in 1962? If you were be very greatful that you are alive now. John F. Kennedy was incredibly ill-suited to take over the Presidency when he did. He was terribly ill physically. He was a compulsive adulterer who could barely devote the time needed for his job. He was thoroughly ruthless, dishonest, vengeful and self-centered. And above all he was reckless. He thrived on personal and political recklessness. In 1962 I was a child. Whenvever I feel badly, I think of how easily it could all have have ended in October 1962 during the Cuban missile crisis. Count your blessings folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's hard to make the Kennedy story boring...","review":"A poorly written \\"investigative\\" piece using circumstantial evidence to support its condemnation of the Kennedy family. Other novels and biographies have been able to tell the story of the Kennedys' corruption without sounding fanatical in its obsession with obscure facts and events. The writer sounds almost petulant."},{"rating":"1","title":"close but no cigar","review":"I used to think Seymour Hersh was a dedicated journalist but this book, although right on many parts about JFK and his father, seems as if it was written by an ex-lover of one of the Kenndey's who got screwed over. Granted Jack did put himself in danger by sleeping with a lot of women (which all of Washington knew) but he misses his character completely which somebody would with there simple-minded christian outlook on life. I would say 3/4ths of this book is right but this rest is fabrications and falsehoods propagated by Kennedy bashers (who exist to this day) but on many points he is dead wrong such as Vietnam, the Bay of Pigs, the mafia-CIA murder plots, and so on.

Two things are not so nice. First: If the hand piece is in it's holder when you put the tank on to use, you can't get it out without removing the full tank from the unit. Second: The tank is the cover for the unit when not in use, With the hand unit in it's holder and the tip in place, the tank (cover) does not work unless you remove the tip first (Bummer).

In most cases I have had to replace the units because of leaks in the hose. The cost of repairing the hose almost equals the cost of a new unit, so I always end up buying one.

Except for the color of the reservoir, this one is the same as and cost $15 less than I paid for the original. The only functional difference is the slider control on the head.

It puts the grape fields in perspective.Read \\"Cliff Notes\\" if you're in a jam, and need to get the gist of the real book in your system. However, if you have the time, read all 600+ pages of Steinbeck's magnificent story.

My advice would be ensure line of sight and don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable, stay away (with H1000)","review":"Attempted to use it with my Harmony 1000. It works for ~ 5 minutes right after updating both the remote and the extender from the computer, then stops working. The little \\"sending RF signal\\" icon does flash on the remote, but the extender does not seem to receive any signals whatsoever. Nothing gets it working again (rebooting the extender, rebooting the remote, pressing connect on the extender, etc.) -- except re-upating both the remote and extender via USB from the computer. Then it works again for ~ 5 minutes. I doubt it has to do with interference, since I am performing my tests with the remote right next to the extender. Of course, I have updated both the remote and extender with the latest firmware.I do like everything else about the H1000, and the IR works fine, so now I'm desperately seeking an alternative RF solution for that remote."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this with Harmony One","review":"Even though this item is listed as an \\"accessory\\" to the Harmony One on Amazon's page, it isn't compatible with it.

The camera wasn't abused; I was filming with it one morning and it was performing normally, then suddenly not. I attempted to get a repair estimate and it wasn't easy, even at designated RCA repair shops. I was told that it would cost less to buy a new camera than it would to have this one fixed.

The story idea itself is bottom-of-the-barrel \\"first season\\" quality. The treatment (or lack thereof) of the STNG characters is embarassing.

Not this one. It's poorly written and inconsistent. It's written in 2 styles, that of a pulp mystery from the 1940s and in \\"real time\\" as a Captain's log. It's difficult to figure out what is going on at first. An object has been stolen, one that is needed to save the ship. It's obvious from almost the beginning who has stolen the object and you'll probably guess right away, but you have to slog through this awful book to find out if you''re correct.

Dean Wesley Smith is one of my favorites, and the book's certainly written in his familiar style, but I think he fell short of the mark on this one. I kept waiting for the story to grip me, but it never did, and I figured it out way before Dix did.I did, however, LOVE the cover. As I have said in the past, I *do* buy books for their covers, and having met the artist, Sonia Hillios, at Shore Leave at the very time she had finished painting this one, well, I just had to have it when I saw it for sale.But unless you simply must have a complete set of TNG paperbacks or adore the covers like I do, you can skip this one and not be any worse for it.That having been said, I hope Dean gets a chance to try again, because I like the idea of Dixon Hill, and I'm sure Dean does, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame, dull mystery","review":"Dull characters and a very slow-moving plot make this the worst Star Trek novel I've ever read.

Speaking as a geologist, we actually do have a clear understanding of how oil, gas and coal (e. g., Hypersea) form. The reason most oil is found in the Middle East is because of ancient oceanic productivity in the Tethyan seaway resulting from marine upwelling during the Mesozoic. Gold's thesis is therefore unnecessary. I edited the English translation of Vladimir Vernadsky's book The Biosphere. Vernadsky tells us that there is indeed a Deep Hot Biosphere. It has formed, however, by bacteria moving downward, not by organisms coming up from the the earth's interior where temperatures and pressures make life impossible.

My only complaint is it is hard to clean and looks dusty after extended use (months) and that one of the locking mechanisms on the suitcase do not lock all the way so my suitcase is slightly open on one side (which is frustrating and looks bad).

Sure, there are even omissions there, but it's the best one will get. But if I were you, I'd buy the albums. Each one is a classic, and even the less famous cuts will make you begging for more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this album","review":"Give me a break! If anybody who already owns 'are you experienced' and 'electric ladyland' buys this album, you can call that person a freak of nature. If you are looking to buy a one single CD Hendrix compilation, ANY other compilation out there is better (there are at least two in the market these days).Why dont they re-release something like 'Live at Monterey' instead of another compilation? Who do they expect to buy this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the same","review":"It is now getting VERY SAD that we are getting yet another greatest hits CD of the same songs from the greatest guitarist ever.Fans around the world 'were' very happy to hear of the Hendrix Family getting the rights to Jimi's music.But the have now lost the plot completly.I have lost count of how many compilation CDs they have put out in only a few short years.This was the last straw.Of course the music is great and the songs still hold up well but my point is that there is still hundreds of hours of un-released music that must be heard.THAT IS WHAT ITS ALL ABOUT. 'IT'S THE MUSIC'The music is what we pay to hear, not a different arrangement of the same songs or a different cover, it's discovering a new Jimi Hendrix song that we may not have ever heard, that is much more exciting for music fans in general.I hope I have made my point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jimi did not want this released!","review":"I can not believe the Hendrix Family decided to rerelease this, how ridiculous!

It has all these songs including a lot more and a disk of live songs from different concerts. There just trying to make a few bucks, which they can't make much because Hendrix Fans aren't stupid.

Why in the world are they already putting out a compilation album when they only have three original albums out? That's ridiculous. Way too soon.As compilations go, this isn't very good.

Mediocre acting, but enjoyment of the movie is largely spoilt by the extremely poor DVD transfer, at least on the disc I received. The audio was so unintelligible at times I had to bring on the subtitles and gunshots sounded like fire crackers popping. Daylight scenes are often so dark one simply cannot see into the shadows.

Another downside is the author no longer supports the code in the book so if problems happens you are on your own, I would think a publisher would support their own code and be able to answer questions about it.

I read the manual to try to figure out what I'm doing wrong (that in itself is a bad sign, you shouldn't have to read the manual just to figure out how to play a game) and the instructions on how to drift are really basic.The instructions are:1. Turn into the corner2. Let off the gas3. Turn through the corner.Sounds simple right?If only it worked that way.What ends up happening is you slide through the corner and then continue to slide all the way around and continue to slide.I'm not impressed.

The graphics are good, very good actually, and the replay value is good. When you start off it seems like it will be a easy to go through the whole game without a lose but it gets very tough as you move on to faster cars.

He briefly discussed the Smithsonian Institution's interest in NAGPRA, but he failed to mention (maybe because he was unaware of it) the National Museum of the American Indian Act. SI is governed by the NMAI Act (1989), not NAGPRA (1990). This is just one of a number of omissions and misrepresentations.

Riddle of the Bones is more fiction than fact in that it contains numerous errors, indicating that the author, who claims to be a journalist, did not check his sources. He writes about real people involved in the case without interviewing them first, thus telling, in some cases, blatent lies.

If the author makes one error, there may be others, just as when someone lies to you once, there is no way to know when they might lie again, so everything they say must thereafter be taken with a grain of salt. Because the author of Riddle of the Bones gets so much wrong with regard to the religion of Asatru and comes across as noticeably biased against Asatru (a subject which I have had occassion to study), I have no reason to believe the rest of the book is any more accurate and truthful than those inaccurate Asatru parts.

On the opening track 'New England Blues' you do get this mixture of styles. Another trademark of his occurs after four and a half minutes of the opening track when he starts a walking 4 to the bar left-hand.Whatever he's playing Montoliu is an inspired improvisor with technique in abundance.

However, this combination of styles which is woefully rare in today's dance compilations- most of which narrowly focus on only one highly specific style or scene- is positively WRECKED by the ummm, I guess we're calling that \\"mixing\\". Most computer literate folks could do the same with any of a number of low-budget music mixing programs. Apologies, folks, but cross fading the first and last 5 seconds of successive songs is not generally deemed \\"mixing\\".

However, Thal actually does a great job on vocals - he actually has quite a dynamic range.One of Ron Thal's personal favorite songs on the album, \\"I Can't Play the Blues,\\" is a cut on his ability to play with emotion.

The recording was originally released by Private Music, which led retailers to mistakenly file it as \\"New Age.\\" Instead it is mid-'80s fusion, built on elements of rock, jazz, electronic and classical music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best War Story Ever","review":"I've never been a big fan of war stories, but this book won me over wholeheartedly. Caputo tells his own personal account of Vietnam, from being an innocent midwest boy hungry for adventure, to an aged, broken man torn apart by war. He goes into the military, ambitious for glory and battle. He goes through a long journey of disappointments, setbacks and helplessness. He manages to climb his way up the military ladder, but the more successful he becomes, the more the events spiral out of control. Caputo's story is honest and personal, not sparing himself anything, but taking you deep into the mind of a soldier."},{"rating":"2","title":"I felt as if I was in the foxhole","review":"Beside me, my buddy, Philip Caputo, was burning a leech from his stomach. I was focused on the tree line 100 yards east. There was a sniper in the waving palms and Caputo was next on watch so I could use my zippo on one of the slimey bastards. The air was as heavy as wet burlap and the sweat caused my vision to blur. Caputo brings us this close to what it felt like to be in 'Nam fighting a mindless battle against the little people who ruled the night. This memoir is incredibly accurate in its protrayal of the battles both within the grunts and outside.Ron Lealos author of Don't Mean Nuthin'"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one great Book, I have read this Book Twice,","review":"This is the best book I have ever read. It bringsback alot of memory's from the Nam. I have alsoseen the move, which I think was good but not as good as the Book. Keep up the good work, and thank you for the memory's, they were not all bad, some were Very Good, You did not have to be there to enjoy this book. The book it's self brings you right in the action. You feel what they felt you see what they saw, it brings you right along with them when thay go on patrol,when they set a ambush or was ambushed, you feel the pride in every one of them. Even though thay were Marines.I was ARMY.THANKS GREAT BOOK"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I was very impressed with the order of A Rumor of War. The book shipped quickly and arrived between the 7-14 day window. The service was professional. The book details matched the quality of the book. I am very pleased with the service provided."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read","review":"Phillip Caputo's \\"Rumor of War\\" is a classic true story of his time in Vietnam as a young lieutenant. Caputo really describes his time in country which was frustrating and, obviously life changing for him. My heartfelt thanks go out to him and the others who served in Vietnam and came home to a country that didn't appreciate their sacrifices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Software Geek","review":"Just noticed this was on the NYT list for 2012 and am elated. I read this book first in 1979 as a high school student considering my options. This book shook me to the core as any book that details a war should. Strong well written account of a brutal time, by someone who was there. Vivid images of a place and time that everyone should read. A must read, not just for the historical account of a war but for the timeless story of a man coming to terms with himself and his choices."},{"rating":"2","title":"A History Book I Actually Enjoyed!","review":"I'm a freshman in college and I just finished reading this book for my history class. When I first started reading it I thought that it was going to be some boring old war story. But one night when I sat down to continue my reading, I got a different feeling from it. I no longer felt like I was reading it just to do my paper, I was reading it to learn of the past. It captured my attention to the point where I could almost swear that I was there, could see the dark rice paddies at night on watch. I could almost smell the decay as he IDed the bodies of his fallen friends. This is a book to learn from and one to remember. An excellent book for anyone wishing to know the experiences of a soldier and how those experiences shape who he becomes. I know that this is one book I will not be returning at the end of the semester."},{"rating":"1","title":"a Farce of war","review":"I wouldn't bother reading another book?? by this author?? again.It was really boring,nothing magnetic about the \\"facts\\" of His story.Yes,I read through the end finally but really disappointed.I wasted a lot of time instead of my Bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Transaction","review":"Good Transaction.. Received the book quickly and in great condition. Brand new and wrapped nicely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caputo wasn't much of a marine","review":"Caputo wasn't much of a marine. He started complaining about Vietnam before he arrived. Every page is filled with criticism, cynicism, griping, complaining, and self-serving tripe. He wanted to be a hero, but he didn't have what it took to be anything but a whining wimp. Certainly he writes well. But writing well and living well are entirely different. He doesn't understand honor or duty. Sure the war was politicized, but so is every war. Sure the rules of engagement were stupid, but a soldier serves. Caputo did not serve; rather he whined. Many of us who served in Vietnam believed there were many things that made no sense. But we didn't turn tail and run. We served. For those who want to understand what is was like to be a soldier in Vietnam, read \\"We Were Soldiers Once... and Young\\" or \\"Steel My Soldiers' Hearts\\". If you want to know what is was like to be useless in Vietnam, read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor leader of men.","review":"This is a good example of a group of men with poor leadership. A platoon leader and platoon sargent are supposed to keep their men under control. I know from experience, I was an Army grunt there in 1968. We never lost control of our men, and I don't remember ever getting any \\"Ice Cream\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The realities of war","review":"I found this book to be so raw, and so terrifying that it was difficult for me to put it down. Philip Caputo puts the life of an everyday solider during the Vietnam War into a light that I believe does justice to every veteran of the war. He very articulately describes the horrors, and utter impossibilities of fighting a guerilla war in unfamiliar territory, and does so with a writing style that will make you feel as though you are crouched in a foxhole right next to him in the dense jungles of Vietnam. This book is an absolute must read for anyone interested in the Vietnam War, or for anyone who is sick of the constant \\"glamorization\\" of war by Hollywood."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rumor of War","review":"I must say this book really opened my eyes. I never quite understood why many people have troble whith thier lives after coming back from war. Well this book totaly opened my eyes. It showed my the horrors of war. It showed me what people go through. It contains a little bit of everything action, hummor, and most of all honesty. If you want a book that will give you the absoulutly brutally honest truth of Vietnam this is the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required Reading","review":"This was on the required reading list for a writing class I took last spring, and I wasn't exactly looking forward to hundreds of pages on the Vietnam War. However, Caputo's compelling account of his experiences not only held my interest, but certainly gave me a more accurate account of the Vietnam \\"Conflict\\" than any history text could have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Veitnam in its most brutal truth.","review":"The story of the young Caputo who goes to war and returns scared for life. The book is hard to put down and is a book that is sad, and will change the way Americans think of war, and Veitnam. A classic told through eyes of the average grunt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"Reading this you feel like you are right alongside the patrol. It's hard to get the images out of your head and its only reading material. Imagine being there! As the author of \\"The Patriot's Way\\" I recommend this book very much!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-written and keeps your running along!","review":"Got this book and \\"The Bamboo Chest: An Adventure in Healing the Trauma of War\\" and I consider them the two best non-fiction books written on Vietnam, Caputos back then and Cork Graham's just this year. Get both, along with \\"Dispatches\\" and you will have the best written books that keep you going until you're at the end and then as in the case of Graham's book I wanted to read parts two and three of his trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Others have said it better than I can","review":"'A Rumor of War', along with James Webb's 'Fields of Fire', are the two best personal accounts of the Vietnam war. Caputo possesses remarkable ability to chronicle the surreal, Alice in Wonderland quality of the Vietnam experience for a wide range of readers - from those who remember it firsthand to others who weren't yet born. No need to hear any more from this reviewer; go get the book and see for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've read it 3 times","review":"I first read it in high-school, Read it again in college, just finished reading it a third time (4 years out of school). I was as good as the first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great span of experience","review":"This an excellent description of the beginning of the American ground involvement in Viet Nam. I especially like the way Caputo describes his and his fellow Marines' attitudes before they shipped out, and how they soon changed as they started to fight the war. It took me several reads to fully comprehend how much he and his fellows changed in less than a year. His account of the fall of Saigon is a real snapper too, when it's compared to the beginning of the book. A fine companion to the Best and The Brightest, and A Bright and Shining Lie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad and Honest","review":"I was in Da Nang in 1969 and brought back used war equipment and used marines on my troop transport LSD USS Vancouver. I hauntingly remember the men with the 1000 yard stare and the faces of old age on men of twenty to twenty five years old. This book has provided me with all the realism and horrifying detail of the war of my generation and the reasons those men wore the expressions in their eyes and displayed a numbness in their personalities. More than any films or other books of the Viet Nam war that I have since seen or read, \\"A Rumor of War\\" has presented and captured the pure folly, waste, and bravery of our ground forces of that time - and this has been presented in a beautiful, engrossing, literary style that gave me two sleepless nights when I couldn't put the book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great insight to the Vietnam war from a personal viewpoint","review":"A fast read, excellent writing , if you really want to know about Vietnam, please read this book... the only small problem i had was in the ending, i would have like to know what happened to the other 3 men. otherwise a wonderful book..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book Fit For A Queen","review":"This is a must have for Queen Mary fans. The book covers the Queens career from inception to roughly 1994. This is an excellent book that covers extensively in both photos and text.

Add this to your collection and you will not be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appears to ignore actual readings in favor of simple chart","review":"This device gives the same reading to everyone who enters the same height and weight, regardless of their actual body composition. Interestingly, it also asks your age and gender, and completely ignores this information also. It will refuse to calculate unless you touch the \\"electrodes,\\" but no matter who touches the electrodes, it gives the same result. In other words, it is a simple calculator, disguised as a measuring device. If you are looking for a device that will give consistent results, then you're in luck. But if you want an actual measurement, you won't find it here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Complete","review":"Very disappointing. Even though the description claims there are 45 episodes, there were in fact 47 in total. And unfortunately, the only reason I purchased this entire set was to see the two episodes which happen to be missing (Mad Dog Coll Story, Parts 1 and 2). Don't claim this is a \\"complete series\\" when there are in fact some episodes missing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Release 'Mad Dog Coll' in A 2nd Volume","review":"For the many of us who own the first volume, please release a second volume containIng the rest of the series, including the omitted episodes, Mad Dog Coll, parts I and II.

But I'm glad he did it. He discusses honestly the very difficult decisions and emotions families of \\"no hope, no quality of life\\" patients face.

It was \\"Dirty Girl\\" off Earthshaker, and I was blown away instantly. I saw my first concert at 14, and have been a die hard fan since. I've seen them over 10 times in 4 different states. Being from the Bay Area, I'm partial to Bay area bands. This album captures fully the essence and energy of a Y&T concert. Menikette's riffs are razor sharp on \\"forever\\" and \\"mean Streak\\", and beautifully melodic on \\"Winds of Change\\" and \\"I believe in You\\". This is a must have for any Y&T collector."},{"rating":"2","title":"FAREWELL TO THE BEST BAND IN THE WORLD","review":"RECORDED DURING THEIR FAREWELL TOUR FOR THEIR FINAL GREAT ALBUM \\"TEN\\".THIS PARTICULAR LINEUP HAD A LOT OF ENERGY AND MADE THIS ONE OF THE BEST LIVE ALBUMS EVER.IF Y&T WAS GREAT IN THE STUDIO,THEY WERE JUST AS GREAT LIVE.THEY PICKED A GREAT SELECTION OF THEIR BEST SONGS.NOT A BAD CHOICE IF YOU ARE JUST GETTING INTO Y&T.STEF BURNS REALLY GAVE THIS BAND A SHOT OF ADRENALINE,I LIKE THE FACT THAT HE SHARED LEAD GUITAR WITH DAVE MENIKETTI.ALL THE GREATNESS OF THIS BAND IS ALL OUT ON THIS RELEASE.AS USSUAL ANOTHER GREAT ALBUM FOR Y&T."},{"rating":"2","title":"hard hitting clear ROCK AND ROLL!","review":"Yesterday and today is no doubt one of the best rock bands ever to come out of the San Francisco Bay Area. 17 years of hard hitting rock and roll.

Guaranteed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap live set song selection shows why Y & T never made it big.","review":"There are two and 1/2 good songs here; Meanstreak and Hurricane rock, Black Tiger starts to rock but gets tedious. Everything else is either a crap ballad, an obscure album track, or a lame repeat 4 words ad naseum excuse for a song. The 10 album has great songs, hard times is NOT one of them. Nothing from Contageous, no lipstick and leather, nothing from Down For the Count. And nobody wants to hear anything from the first two albums. Poor live song selection and chosing the worst song from an album to be the single, are why Y & T never made it big. Can't say whether this is what they sound like live because every show where Y & T were an opening act that I had tickets for Dio, Yngwie, Y & T never bothered to show up. A band that never really cared and it shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Over the Top Metal, a must have for any metal head.","review":"The Offical Metal Drummers Bible.Dave Lumbardo is GOD."},{"rating":"2","title":"The First song is great","review":"But that is about it...

I have never been a huge fan of Testament but this CD really made me a believer. Buy it and hear for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of Their Best","review":"I have followed Testament since the beginning, and I like alot of their material. But this was the first CD(LOW was close...)that just blew me away. While I wished Skolnick was still in the band and on this CD, James Murphy does an excellent job as usual(I just prefer Skolnick's lead style, esp. Practice What You Preach era.....). With the addition of Slayer's Ex drummer Dave Lombardo, & the great, powerful vocals by Chuck Billy(he has never sounded better.....), this awesomely produced collection of 'just-the-right length' metal songs is sure to be something all Testament fans will enjoy. This album starts out with a bang and never lets up."},{"rating":"2","title":"DNR","review":"This is one of Testament's best. Only bad thing is that James Murphy wasn't able to do many solos. Lombardo has his feet back while Peterson creates the thrashing. Chuck's voice scares the devil and Steve DiGiorgio takes care of the low end like no other bassist can. Definitely worth the money. Keep up the thrash and trash the trendy bands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Testament is back","review":"If your a fan of old school heavy metal Testament then this CD is most definatly for you!

The Gathering for me, simply stands as a monument of my youthful rage. I find this album to hit all the right spots between death metal, thrash metal, accessibility, growls, singing, groove riffing etc etc. It contains all the ingredients to cement it in my mind as a pure classic. I don't know if it matters if this album is \\"thrash\\", or \\"modern thrash\\" or, \\"death trash\\"...in other words, I don't care if you are a nostalgic Testament fan, nor do I care if you find yourself to be an elitist death metal fan. This album transcends all boundaries. But then again, I already stated my bias at the inception of this review, so I would understand if you had to BUY this album for yourself and find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where have I heard this before...?","review":"Unbelievable. A band that is solidly routed in the old style of standard thrash music decides to regress backwards a bit on this last release. Apparently the sheer mundane boredom (and probable bad sales) that was \\"Demonic\\" didn't seem to upset Mr. Billy all that much. Of course, this time around, we have a who's who of the metal world... mix in James Murphy (ex-Death/Cancer/Obituary) with veterans Dave Lombardo (duh) and Steve DiGiorgio (Sadus/Death) and it is a pretty fearsome line-up. But, as luck would have it, Testament throws out the progressions in their style over the last decade or so in favor of the same old cup of watered down meade. Songs like \\"Do Not Resuscitate\\" which should have been called \\"Please Resuscitate Our Talent\\" and \\"Legions Of The Dead\\" will probably entertain the masses of rivetheads who can't get enough of that blotter-acid type unfiltered noise. Listen only in well lit areas... for your own sanity!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Testament's strongest album!","review":"I know that is a strong statement to back up since Testament has so many strong albums, but I belive this is the strongest. This album is total hardcore. The guitars are ferious, the drumming is like a machine gun (thanks to ex-Slayer drummer Dave Lambardo), and Chuck Billy's vocals are better than ever! Instead of total Death Metal vocals like on Testaments last album Demonic, Billy goes for a deeper more traditional approach and mixes in some death metal vocals every so ofter. I can't stress how good this album is. This album is for true metal fans! Forget Metallica's St. Anger...buy this Testament album instead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Holy Cow!!!","review":"Buy this immediately! Trashiest thing Testament ever did and probably the Holy Grail of 90'ies trash metal...Dave Lombardo's work is simply mind-blowing in this one. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hardcore metal kings at their best (so far)","review":"I'm one of those that loved Chuck's singing on Demonic. But, this has got to be the best album since Low came out. They completely threw out the ballad tradition and hit hard with extreme metal. This album will go a long way. They seem to enjoy those prophetic songs like Three Days In Darkness and also Fall Of Sipledome. It's kind of like The New Order album, just the 1999 version. My personal pics are Careful What You Wish For, Down For Life,and DNR. Chuck said it plain and simple, \\"This is the album where everything dies.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Way better than Demonic.....","review":"Testament's last cd Demonic really sucked. So i was a little hesitant on this new one The Gathering. But boy what an improvement. This album might be the metal album of the year. From begining to end it doesn't quit. Its easily Testament's heaviest yet and easily the most aggresive. Chuck Billy laid back on the \\"death\\" vocals which is the biggest improvement overall. The one bad thing about this album is that James Murphy's leads are almost nonexistent. But everything else is so powerful that you don't even miss it; that says alot because James' leads are what made Low so great. This is an incredible album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Overrated!","review":"This is not the same sound as the 80's albums or 90's Souls of Black(my farvorite album of all time). This is that new, slow, lame sound that all the 80's thrash bands seem to develop in the late 90's. You know what I'm talking about. The same thing that happened to Overkill, Anthrax, and now Exodus. Why in god's name this album has so many 5 star ratings is beyond me. One dumb reviewer stated that this album is their best album since Low...What a lame statement. First of all Low sucked too. And the only thing to come out in since that album was demonic which was a miserable failure. Stick with the old stuff. This ain't it. It's not that this album is horrible, but it definately isn't in the same league as the first four albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whats the big deal ?","review":"Yeah, Testament are back again. I see so many positive reviews for this album, but I did not enjoy it. I rarely listen to it and I honestly think its one of their worst. Some people dont like anything after Souls of Black because they changed, but I enjoyed Low and Demonic.... just not The Gathering.

Being a fan of earlier Testament releases, I rushed out and bought this \\"gem\\". Boy, do I wish I had saved 15 bucks!!! Every damn song on this thing sounds EXACTLY the same. Dave Lombardo's \\"masterful\\" drumming just oozes excellence and originality. Chuck Billy's \\"vocals\\" are the sounds that every ear should hear. Where in the hell is James Murphy on this \\"masterpiece\\"? As far as I heard, he had one, maybe two \\"solos\\". To listeners everywhere....DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE...DON'T BELIEVE OTHER REVIEWS...UNLESS YOU WANT MONOTONOUS, REPETATIVE CRAP...STAY AS FAR AWAY FROM THIS \\"GENIUS\\" WORK BY TESTAMENT AS POSSIBLE!!!...AND TO TESTAMENT...PLEASE, GUYS, NO MORE \\"MUSIC\\" OK?...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tetament's best","review":"This newest offering from Testament is by far their best.

It also has some of the best backup musicians in the history of metal: Steve DiGiorgio (Death, Sadus), James Murphy (Death, Obituary), and Dave Lombardo (Slayer), in addition to the original members. What else can i say? Just buy it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Testament is the the best and \\"The Gathering\\", is the proof","review":"I absolutely love TESTAMENT.

This 42 minute album just never lets up.All I can say is that if you want to hear one of the most underrated and flawless metal releases to ever be released, pick this CD up ASAP.If you're one of those people that may have never cared about Testament before, this album will change your opinion 180 degrees by the time the 1st track ends."},{"rating":"2","title":"A big gem, diamond in the rough just like Mike","review":"This golden ticket of a VHS, that I found knocked me off of my feet.

Dr. Droleskey uses his extensive knowledge of Catholic political and social teaching to expose the flaws in the system, both theoretical and practical; and to map out a strategy for Catholics who wish to use the system to combat the terrible social consequences of those flaws, and at the same time not allow their principles to be compromised through subservience to the flawed system itself.

It's small ... only measures 6\\" x 5.5\\" and only half an inch thick, but it has a wonderful selection of pictures of rooms in all styles. All of the rooms are sized like you would find in a regular home -> too often design books feature fabulous large rooms that most of us don't have. I don't think anyone could flick through this book and not find rooms that they like. It's great for showing different styles, but also shows great colour combinations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Variety of Rooms!","review":"I really like this book, I browsed through it (the UK version) when I was visiting over there, and bought it over here when I came back to save on my luggage weight. I like the fact that it is small in size (to bring with you to the stores), but it is also why I gave it 4 stars. The thing that I enjoy most about books of this type, is the ability to look at large pictures of the rooms and then have a breakdown of them so that you can figure out how to create the look for yourself. Most of the rooms are not what I imaginge for myself, but it is a great variety that will appeal to a broad audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"simple","review":"This is not what i expected at all. it provides very simple information that a child can guess. anyhow, i will make sure next time i choose the right book. but not bad for the novice."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!","review":"I bought this camera for my daughter in the summer...it worked for about a week perfectly and then after that the pictures started to get blurry an ever since the pictures taken were a total mess!!!...i do not advise any one to purchase this camera..it is a waste of money..the videos are actually pretty good..however when u play back on the camera there is no sound..thats annoying, also the zoom function is horrible as u zoom in the opictures get blurrier and blurrier.

I almost find them to be more historically important than his other work for two reasons- 1) his style photojournalism is artful but perhaps less documentative than it could be. 2) The significant style with which he captures his often famous portaitees encapsulates their entire being- they are often the first image to come to mind when one thinks of the sitter, they are simply extremely telling and powerful pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Why I Love Terry","review":"This is an excellent read.

To mix football metaphors, he kept piling on the dead ball fouls until my patience clock ran out. Terry whines about his 3/3 marriages and divorces. Hey! Game over! Get on with it! An especially long and vitriolic rant is rained upon Divorce Lawyers. It becomes evident that what we have here is a misogynist attempting to hide under pseudo-humor.

Since our native language is Spanish, we decided to buy this version as well, but I was disappointed with the translation. Every noun is written using diminutives (ojitos, piececitos, boquita...)not a good idea if the whole point of the book is to teach the body parts names to a Baby. But what I found outrageous is that they even use a word for \\"hands\\" that means something else in Spanish: \\"manitas\\". When you translate a book to Spanish you should consider that you are doing it for all Latin America, Central America, North America and Spain.In my opinion, this nice book was completely diminished by a poor translation."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"piececitos\\"","review":"It's really hard to find board books in the original Spanish, which means the majority of books available are translations that don't have the same rhyme/meter/ease of the original. Our version of this books reads \\"piececitos\\" for \\"feet\\" which is excessively awkward (less awkward would be \\"piecitos\\") and, according to some, incorrect. We're raising our son to be bilingual and since he gets English at school we try to exclusively speak Spanish in the home. It's hard to find culturally/linguistically accurate books in Spanish for him that aren't 1) bilingual and/or 2) sloppily translated.

His scenarios are ridiculous--now I really believe Scott did it. I feel that buying this book was a mistake on my part. Don't buy it. Throw it out. It sucks.

There is not one thing new in this book only the author looks at everything differently than most of the world! This one is not worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real Truth","review":"I read Presumed Guilty and found it facinating. I have followed the case since day one. My initial theory was that Scott did it. Then, when he said he was fishing, and their bodies were found in close proximity, I felt that the killer or killers had a perfect opportunity to dump their bodies in the bay and frame him. His actions led the masses to believe he was guilty, including me. But what is revealed in the book leaves a lot of doubt. Was Geragos doing his job, or was he playing in Modesto? Why didn't he did deeper and reveal what Matt Dalton did in the book? If Scott is guilty, he should be executed. If not, then let's get to the truth. Bottom line. Presumed Guilty makes the reader think instead of reacting to media blitz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Presumed?","review":"5 years later, no higher court appeal, no credible request for a new trial, no false arrest/imprisonment/ countersuit, his own defense attorney bailed out on him.

Get real, the book was about making a buck for the author, pure and simple."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage, Garbage, GARBAGE","review":"It is with deep regret that I am unable to give this book zero stars. This guy gives books a bad name. Filled with recycled rumor and innuendo, one can only conclude that Dalton is trying to make a quick buck at the Rocha family's expense. The only thing worse than this collection of BS is seeing Dalton interviewed on TV.

I bought it yesterday and read it twice. Once was a speed-read for the \\"juicy stuff\\" and when I didn't find any, I slowly read it thinking I'd come across new revelations sooner or later. No personal conversations between Scott and the author were written about. No new \\"evidence\\" was revealed. It was just a bunch of \\"what if's\\" and \\"could have's\\". To be honest, this read like Jackie and Lee Peterson wrote it. All nonesence and nothing that made me believe even for one second that an innocent man is behind bars. Sorry........I was hoping it would be otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitiful","review":"I must say, this is one of the strangest discussions about how our judicial system works, or doesn't work, that I've ever read. I think Mr. Dalton should have snapped out some real facts to Catherine Crier rather than just sing the praises of Dan Abrams at least six times while a guest of Ms. Crier's show. Give me a break! If this stuff he claims in his book really happened and it was not introduced at trial, then some explaining needs to be done by someone! I wish I would have never bothered buying this book.

This could have created reasonable doubt. But it didn't. Scott is on death row now. So why write this book of all the possible scenarios that could have been but were not. I don't get it. Matt Dalton, I ask you did the Peterson's pay you to write this book? Were you to somehow create \\"reasonable doubt\\" in the minds of people with your book? Well you failed. Because there is no doubt in my mind now that none of the other possibilities could have possibily been real. Scott did this murder. Oh all that talk about anchors. Yeah Scott really had good reasons for making anchors. We all make anchors all the time. This book is GARBAGE. It is self serving for the Peterson family. The truth is that Peterson will be on death row for a long, long, long time before anything is ever decided."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignores the obvious","review":"This book ignore the obvious question that should come to mind:if indeed, there was evidence that would have exonerated Scott Peterson or at least have shed reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case, why did his legal defense team not present it in court? Where were those witnesses, where was the evidence?Unlike some other defendants on death row, Scott was not represented by an incompetent, inexperienced and/or overworked public defender.

It is an insult to people's intelligence! Did you forget that Scott told Amber he \\"lost\\" his wife and the same day went out and bought a boat. Was it just coincidence that Laci and Connor were found in the exact location he went \\"fishing\\"?

It is very hard to buy the fact that an innocent Scott Peterson would have allowed his defense to ignore so many facts, if indeed they are facts; i.e. the 6 eyewitnesses, the scream, the brown van, the other pregnant women who vanished...This book is mainly about accusing the Modesto police of misconduct. If the allegations here ARE true-then of course, it is horrifying and scary, as any one of us could be convicted if we have the misfortune of losing a spouse to murder...Also, if true, I have to trust the Supreme Court will ultimately grant a new trial. But this book does not show any facts that stand out-why aren't those witnesses available and screaming aloud still?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was very disappointed","review":"There are so many things in this book that Matt Dalton presents as \\"facts\\" that are false, according to the court transcript. Anyone who followed this case avidly would be able to spot all the falsehoods immediately.For example, he states that Amy testified to going home with Scott and Laci on the 23rd, had pizza, and watched a video with them. This is NOT true, as Amy testified in court.Also, I think he had too many possible \\"theories\\" as to who killed Laci. Anyone could do that with any murder.

Shameful!","review":"The only reason this book was written was to profit off the Peterson trial. The defense team knows full well that Scott Peterson is guilty. How Mark Garogos can sleep at night is beyond me. The case against Scott Peterson is rock solid and he is the text book example of a sociopath. If anyone has any doubts just read 'A Deadly Game\\" and you won't have any more. The case is proven and is highly detail. THAT is the book that contains evidence the jury never heard. It is quite detailed and thoroughly investigated.

No substance. Nothing real. Only supposition. No facts. This book is just maybe this and maybe that. Why would Scott sue for this book to be stopped from being published? Why there is nothing in it, no new information, no big Scott secrets. So it leads me to believe this was a ploy to get us to buy the book. Resonable Doubt...where is the doubt? There is no new evidence. Even as far as an appeal goes, appeals aren't based on evidence not presented. Appeals are usually based on what happened in the courtroom already not new information. I'm mad that I spent my hard earn money on this. But now I will be reading Catherine Crier's book. That what I want, facts, evidence, and the truth about Scott Peterson."},{"rating":"1","title":"No style - No substance","review":"Again, we are punished with another bad book about the Peterson case. When will it ever end?Dalton wastes ink and paper promoting a satanic cult epidemic in California's central valley and never shows any connection between Laci Peterson's murder (or the baby's murder) with any cult.Is this a book, or a over-blown article from \\"The Star?\\" I've seen tabloids better written and more entertaining.If you read \\"The National Enquirer\\" for the past two years, you have read this book.But, Dalton's book is worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this book!","review":"I am one of the few who think that Scott Peterson didn't get a fair trial and I bought this book.

Unbiased and very informative -- perhaps TOO informative, as apparently he was the recipient of a powerful curse which compelled him to commit suicide shortly after this book went into print. The title is a bit misleading, as it focuses primarilly on voodoo and various forms of aboriginal shamanism, with some folklore about shapeshifting and vampirism thrown in.

This book was just not what I expected. Illustrations were great and words in this book were minimal - very appropriate for preschool kids. I had intended this for my school-age kids and it was too simplistic for them.

The author is a betterphoto instructor. She sites endlessly betterphoto student work and teachers. To top it off, the advice wasnt that helpful, the photos were not inspiring at all.

Raps and sings with control, expression, and attitude. Lauryn Hill has nothing on this woman.The backing band... dope. Still hip-hop, but with extra touches of strings and other live intstruments... keeps it sonically interesting without being too far out there. It's not like rapcore or anything.I am a Christian, and I found Ahmad's lyrical focus uplifting.

Many of the songs are repetitious and devolve into (half baked) World music jams. When listening to more recent Soulfly albums and Sepultura's Roots, it is obvious how slap dash this record is. Especially with \\"The Song Remains Insane\\" which is a sloppy and horrible retread of Sepultura's \\"Attitude\\" from the Roots album.There are some saving graces though, as \\"Eye For and Eye\\" and \\"No Hope No Fear\\" are solid efforts, and the superb drumming of Roy Mayorga (Most recently filling behind drums for Sepultura and currently behind the kit for Stone Sour) hold a few of these songs together.When compared to Soulfly's (Most recent) \\"Dark Ages\\", and Sepultura's \\"Dante XXI\\" this album falls flat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow...","review":"this cd just keeps getting better with ever lisen1.Eye for an eye- 5/5No hope = no fear- 4.5/5Bleed- 5/5Tribe- 4/5Bumba- 4/5First Commandment- 5/5BUmbklaatt- 4.5/5Soulfly- 3/5 (not bad for an instrumental)Umbabaruama- 3/5Quilombo- 4/5Fire- 5/5Song Remains INsane- 3.5/5NO- 4.5/5Prejudice- 5/5Karmageddon- 1.5/5 (Bad for an instrumental)Overall this is one of the best cds ever... some of the higlights are eye for an eye (it just ges heavier and heavier), bleed (words cannot describe this track, even fred durst has something 2 offer for once), first commandment (i dont know why but i find my self listening over and over, song about maxs step son, dana) fire (freakin love the guitars at the end) and prejudice (its worth the whole 7 minutes!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOTHING INTERESTING","review":"I like sepultura especially their last albums and even AGAINST but I\`d say that even that not loved AGAINST is better than SOULFLY.

But all in all, not a bad album."},{"rating":"1","title":"This has been done once before, on Roots.","review":"Quite honestly, this album has a decent sound to it. The heaviness, the musicianship, the vocals, the parts all come together nicely most of the time. The problem is that this album is a total 'Roots' rip-off. There's no new material on this album. In addition, the sound gets eminently repetitive over time, as did 'Roots' at times... I recommended it to those who absolutely worship Max Cavalera. Otherwise, the album is completely unoriginal, uncreative, and done much better with Sepultura."},{"rating":"1","title":"2,5 stars","review":"This album is not Sepultura album. if you are waiting for another Chaos ad or Arise or any other good album Sepultura had with Max then forget it.

I understand that he wanted to move on from Sepultura, but why this?? The lyrics are uninspired, and he's lacking the spark of co-writing with former bandmate, Andreas Kisser.

I respect the fact that Max has a lot of pent-up anger; he has the soul to be a musician, but he lacks any musical prowess. He has only got four strings on his guitar, and those aren't even tuned correctly. As a result his music is repetitive and boring; if you've heard one song you've heard them all. If you want to revel in pain, I'd recommend Nine Inch Nails - The Downward Spiral. If you want music to be angry to, I'd recommend Slayer - Reign In Blood. Max is nothing more than a big baby with a big amp."},{"rating":"1","title":"WEAK WEAK WEAK","review":"This album blows. All it is, is a weak rehash of Sepultura's \\"Roots\\" album. It sounds like a \\"Roots\\" B-side album, but unfortunately, instead of Igor, Andreas, and Paulo, Max has recruited some very subpar musicians. I love Sepultura, and while I wish they could have kept the original lineup, I would much rather listen to their new album, \\"Against\\", than to Soulfly. It is just plain boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's really worth 2; I just want to bring the average down.","review":"Oh my. 'Eye For An Eye', 'Tribe', 'Bumba'. All songs that were going to be hits on their first listen. Live favourites, something to jump around like nutters to. Only problem is, it's all been done before - done before better. New fans'll love this, those more familiar with Sepultura's back catalogue will undoubtedly spot the cracks: the aforementioned 'Tribe' is simply a hybrid of 'Ratamahatta' (from 'Roots') and riot-anthem 'Refuse/Resist' ('Chaos A.D.'). Annoyingly safe, 'Soulfly's only innovative moments come from Limp Bizkit's Fred Durst contributing on 'Bleed' to take things in a new direction. This also applies to Dub War's Benji's performance on 'Prejudice'. And if these songs are all so bloody wonderful then why do Soulfly compile half their set list from classic Sepultura tunes? Flames to the usual address, please..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this","review":"This album is sweet. Soulfly has all the elements of an intense band. The harsh vocals, loud guitars and literally thunderous drumming.

The only thing I don't really dig would be the instrumental(s), they might be cool on a tripp!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Comes very close to Sepultura.","review":"This cd just barely misses being better than Sepultura. But Sepultura is a legendary metal band now, and I don't think Max can out do himself on that one. But this cd is really good, and not at all disappointing. It was everything I expected.

I strongly suggest you click the BUY button. because along with countless other metal fans, trust me, Max and his new Soulfly tribe dont dissappoint.Sorry for not writing indecisive comments about Soulfly ppl. I just did it for Sepultura \\"Roots\\". go look if you want...."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Truth about Soulfly","review":"Soulfly's debut album is just as aggressive as some of Sepultura's best work but also shows a maturity in Max Cavelera's songwriting. The cds songs are filled with classic, savage, rip your head off guitar riffs, tribal drums, and really emotional lyrics. In my opinion, no ones voice complements heavy metal music like Max Cavelera's. This is a new beginning for Max, and he couldn't have started out better. And for you that are wondering about Sepultura's new album....honestly the cd sucks. And its not the new singers fault, its just that the songs suck.

As time goes by, Jack learns to cope with the jungle and transforms into Korak, a jungle lord who converses with apes and rides Tantor the bull elephant. Korak rescues a little Arab girl with a hidden background, and the two young people become fast companions of the wild. The action is constant, the plot convoluted but typical of the Tarzan series with never a dull moment. My only objection is the ending of the book. All is, of course, resolved, but it is so quickly done one cannot help wondering if Burroughs was up against a deadline. Nevertheless, it is quick, good reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Son of Tarzan","review":"I thought it was good.It held my interest from page 1 all the way through.If you have read any of the other Tarzan books,then this is a must read.It tells the story of Tarzan's son and his tribulations of how,why and when and what happens on the way to Africa,what happens after he gets there and what happens when he meets up Big Bwana.Marty"},{"rating":"2","title":"an old time favorite.","review":"I loved reading this story again as much as I did the first time over 40 years ago.

The designer of the vessel is a local boatbuilder that develops a radical concept. The town pulls together to help him build and campaign the boat. It is beautifully written and you'll be cheering the team on if you read it.The best part is that anyone who spent any length of time in Oxford would have recognized the characters in the book as the real residents of the town, loosely cloaked in a novel's licensed perspectives. So it truly provides a great insight into life on the Eastern shore.The worst part is that Pope's Tavern had a wonderful mural on the wall commemorating the team's effort and on display was a replica of the cup for all to see. Sadly, the last time we visited Oxford, Pope's was now a B&B;, the Tavern was closed, and the building was up for sale. Oxford will never be the same if Pope's isn't restored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Worked - Had to Return","review":"This item never worked for me.

Unfortunately, these jacks just can't be used to lift the weight, even with an air compressor driving the impact wrench.

Fischer recorded these symphonies for Nimbus over the course of 14 years. The results are excellent, all digital recordings made in the hall where Haydn was in residence for a large portion of his life. Brilliant has secured the rights to these recordings, and now offers them in a handsomely packaged box. Each CD is in a sturdy envelope, and the liner notes are informative.I own \\"period\\" performances of several of these symphonies from Trevor Pinnock and The English Concert, and Fischer's intepretations are worthy contenders in my opinion. Fischer uses modern instruments combined with a period style of playing which is a very appealing combination. I've enjoyed every disc in this 33CD collection. Amazon's \\"new and used\\" partners frequently offer the entire set for under $100... at that price, you truly cannot afford to be without this set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different aqusition sets","review":"This set of recordings is part of the larger box called \\"The Complete Symphonies-Symphonic cycles of the great composers\\".

It's funny, intense, crude, and campy. Despite it's over-the-top nature, certain parts of the movie are surprisingly subtle. The soundtrack pulls off the same effect. As ethnicly eclectic as its cast, the cd sports an impressive assortment of genres. My one protest is the exclusion of \\"The World Is New\\" by Save Ferris, which is one of the best songs in the movie. It's quite an interesting album, it turned me on to a whole spectrum of genres which I had never explored. A signifigant companion to the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Brief Review","review":"Okay,so there's been a lot of griping about the \\"Shooting Star\\" manga series,when the truth is it's not such a bad series.Of course anyone who is interested in getting into the Bebop franchise, shouldn't go to \\"Shooting Star\\" first.In fact this is probably the last Bebop thing you should explore.With all the said,I think the only flaw with the series are some of the personality changes,but they are slight,and I'll let it go, since this just a \\"What if?\\" alternate reality/universe-type situation.The characters designs are also quite different,but I think it fits the whole alternate-universe feel of the manga series.So if you've watched the series,the movie, read other manga series then check this series out.You may be in for a pleasant surprise(or not)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice cap","review":"I bought this for my husband and he really likes it.

I have now read 10 more. The story of Eden Summer and Nevada Blackthorn is one of my favorites. The instant recognition of Nevada as her soul mate draws you to Eden. Her love for a man who has felt so much pain that he no longer believes in love is inspiring. This story was so wonderfully crafted that I felt as though I was standing off to the side and actually watching Eden and Nevada's love blossom.

What I do not like is that she wears her heart on her sleeve and he, not a believer in love, takes what she has to give. He's got too many hangups constantly telling her he doesn't want to hurt her but does it every time and she is his doormat; always available to please him.

I liked the characters Neveda and Eden because they were both strong and thought they both knew what they wanted. I liked Neveda because he said what he meant and didn't care if it shocked people. Eden was good as well because she was the one person who seemed to be able to reach Neveda where others weren't able to come close. And I think that was because of her love for the land and the animals wild and tame that lived on the land. I think that's why she was able to get closer to Neveda better than others.

The music on this cd seems to be a notch up from the the past VeggieTales cds (not that there was anything wrong with them).

One third of the book is complete filler as he lists 60 pages of various beer styles along with their specific gravities, etc. This information could have been presented in a two page spread. Additionally, he offers little in the way of advanced brewing technique. The one saving grace of this book is the recipe section, with interesting ideas like a lambic barley wine and a raspberry imperial stout. If you are looking for a book that offers a firm overview of all-grain brewing then I can recommend 'Dave Miller's Homebrewing Guide' or Noonan's 'Brewing Lager Beer.'

Many CDs make it into my player. Not a lot of them make it back again years later. This guys voice is smooth and familiar.

I personally love the figure and felt that he was calling me stupid since I like the current version and what it has come to mean.I only skimmed the rest of the book but most of it was stories from natives and just more garbage about misinformation.

Why the family disloyalty here? The film only moves to the Bahamas halfway into things. I really think many of the Island characters are Americans faking West Indian accents. The main characters are a rap duo who say they don't want to be exploited by record execs and then they very willingly get exploited. I love seeing actors of color get opportunities to enhance their resumes, but I have to stop giving PC points there. This is a substandard, dumb, uninteresting, poor-quality flick.

At least half the tracks are killer, and you can listen to them over and over and not get tired. Others like No Commands I didn't like because Alexi and what sounds like annother band member are fighting for the role of frontman, and it sounds like a mess. Alexi doesn't have the screaming and rhythm down in Something Wild, but when he gets it right, it's downright viscious.

Looks like it's made well and no complaints by the company who sold it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, dull and... more dull","review":"This book is not especially hard to get into, but finishing it really is a challenge. The whole plot centres around a group of alien beings who crashed on Earth in the thirtienth century and now a wealthy Englishman is trying to revive them, even if it means starting a nuclear war. A solid enough plot. However, its just the way it's done that I dont like. The aliens feature in it at only two points both of which are relatively short. If it wasn't for those two brief sections of the story you wouldn't know the plot even involved aliens and at times it seems to run independently of them. It does feel very Bondian at some points, especially in the parts involving the Russians and the Americans. Not a bad novel, just incredibly boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"good thing it was cheap","review":"looks nice too bad it doesnt work. the second hand comes off and then the clock cant work. good thing it was cheap"},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Leader","review":"A new leader has emerged to guide Corporate America through the confusion and hype of branding in the New Economy.

I got Perversion because I heard the song Falling on the radio and thought that the song sounded a lot like NIN (used to like 'em alot). After listening to the CD it seemed that only Falling and Alive were standout tracks, the rest being filler. Then I put it away for a while. Later, after being introduced to \\"industrial\\" groups like KMFDM, Skinny Puppy, and Front Line Assembly; I listened to it again, fully expecting to hate it. To my surprise, it wasn't all that bad! Granted, I enjoy CD's by the aforementioned groups quite a bit more, I wouldn't call this a good or bad CD, just a bit mediocre. But if you like groups such as Stabbing Westward, NIN, or Filter then you would probably enjoy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gute Mucke","review":"Die Platte ist lustig, die Musik gefaellt mir gut.

Well, they do manage to rock out here and there, though their riffs sound VERY tired when they do. Besides the good lead singer, GK doesn't really have a distinctive sound. Every song, even the supposed \\"showstoppers\\" on this album, sound like industrial deja-vu. I guarantee it, even if you haven't listened to this album, you've already heard it all.So what do we have here? A wannabe industrial band, much like stabbing westward, riding on the coattails of Industrial's few commercial successes (NIN and Marilyn Manson). Nothing terribly interesting, but if you're not looking for something different, and your standards aren't too high, then maybe you should just go ahead and pick this one up, anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great disk, It has to be one of the best ever","review":"Perversion is a great follow up to it's subtitled disk.

Grits sounds just as good as any of those foul mouthed secular rappers like Nelly, Ja Rule or any of those guys. Grits isn't ashamed of their God and they show it by being bold in their lyrics. They do have a couple of songs that are just for fun, for example Tennesse Boyz. That song could be played on secular radio and beat some of the best rap stuff out there. It is a very catchy song. The Art of Translation starts out strong with Here We Go. Coffee and Bonafide open some eyes with this release. I pray God will use it to reach out to those who don't know him.

Now I play the CD (also available as part of the \\"Trilogy\\" package), and I still find joy in the music made by Andreas Vollenweider and Friends. I have all of his CDs (including \\"Live\\"), and the rich variety of rhythms, the complex interwoven melodies and harmonies, the voices, the unexpected instruments - all engage the mind while they move the spirit. Each CD has a distinct personality, and every one of them makes me feel good. \\"Behind the Gardens...\\" is still as fresh for me after all these years as it was the first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark, Real, and Worth Any Effort to Get","review":"The self-described \\"country noir\\" of Gauthier (pronounced go-SHAY, by the way) plumbs emotional bareness you'd find at the core of country, from the perspective of society's misfits and outcasts. It's sometimes hard to imagine country's prom queens and hunka-hunks being credible with such emotion, but Gauthier's tangy/earthy voice leaves no doubt she could walk the walk. Gauthier's music is frank and unvarnished, and she has a knack for keeping the listener engrossed in the world of each song, whether charming or bleak. \\"I Drink\\" has an I-know-what-I-am reality, and the tale of former Texas death row resident \\"Karla Faye\\" and the marvelous lessons of \\"Lifetime\\" are must-listen songs. I'm also partial to \\"Lucky Stars,\\" a song about reaching an impasse that sonically echoes Linda Ronstadt's \\"Long Long Time,\\" and to the wonderful title track that talks about finding your people when you don't fit in where you are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not pretty, but pretty brilliant!","review":"I have not been able to take thus CD out of my deck.

The central relationship develops against a background of medieval history which showcases both without overwhelming either. I wanted to know more about the events of 1216 and I became engrossed in the characters whose story I was reading.Ms Chadwick makes medieval history come alive!Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic, fantastic 5 stars!!","review":"Fantastic story and engaging story-telling. What I generally like about British authors and their style is their realistic approach to the plot and characters - no contrived plots or events happening because the author 'wants' to put her beloved characters in a 'good light'. Despite being a romantic tale it shies away from sentimental nonsense. This story is well told but my only complaint is that I would have liked the main characters to have more time especially at the end. The time they spent earlier in the book seemed furtive and 'snatched' so I would have liked more time for normal interaction. But all in all a strong story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was disappointed in this book. Of all the rich Scripture in the Bible that could really speak to children throughout their day, I found the choices these authors made were not what I would have chosen.

I've known a couple of artists trying to break into the industry with great lyrics, music and powerfully versatile voices, and their demos are returned unopened.

But that's far from the truth. He's as good as they come, and She's All I Ever Had proves just that. I was totally crazy about Livin' La Vida Loca and the first time I heard \\"She's All...\\" I didn't think too much of it, until late one night when I was almost falling asleep listening to the radio, and I realised just how good it was. The flow of the song is great, the music soothing, and the different musical instruments (like the Indian sitar) give an added boost to its romantic touch. Did I mention the entrancing lyrics? Get the CD today! You won't regret it.. Trust me..

Her writing is top-notch and her attention details pulls the reader into her memoir as if the reader was with Tracy throughout her depression.

This book gives hope of recovery from re-current depression and gives tools that anyone with a mental illness can use, despite the fact that it wasn't meant to be a \\"this is how to fix your life book\\". It is the story of one woman and her trials with re-curring depression and how she overcame her \\"Beast\\". A must read for anyone involved in mental health or suffering with depression. I keep my copy close at all times to refer to when I feel I have lost hope of ever being \\"well\\". If you feel the same I would strongly encourage reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brave and Insightful","review":"This is a fascinating first-person account of grappling with a lifelong pattern of depression. Tracy Thompson is tough and honest in looking at herself. She fearlessly searches to find out why this happens to her and what she can do to stop it.With her training as a journalist, she turns an objective eye on herself. It is this honesty that gives the book its strength. The portrait she paints of herself is not flattering. She sees the manipulative and deceptive behavior that she carries on in an effort to keep others near her, to secure herself from falling into another episode of depression.We watch her growth and her setbacks. We go along with her to therapy and to the hospital. It is not an easy book to read; it is painful at times, but it is also a remarkable achievement."},{"rating":"1","title":"More than just depression/abuse","review":"Felt like while reading this that the character of Thomas -she was completely to the end blind to the fact that he was an extraordinarily abusive man who caused her to have an emotional blindness to what he did to her. I feel he prolonged and intensified her depression and for whatever reason reading this book she fails to acknowledge and made excuses for him thru out. Her problems ran deeper than depression. I suffer from severe depression and anxiety amongst other conditions and am a male and feel she could have made this book a whole lot better if that was something she recognized and dealt with instead of sugar coating an obvious situation. I wish her well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book about a personal struggle.","review":"This is a great book about a personal struggle with depression and it might help those who love someone with this disease understand just a bit about the daily struggle and battle with the beast.

Her first person account of living with The Beast made me feel like I am not alone with this disease. Although I appreciated the vignette approach to \\"You Are Not Alone\\", it was Ms. Thompson who I felt a real connection with. I could not finish reading the Cronkite book because it seemed like these stories were the rich and famous talking about their adult onset of depression. The Beast is absolutely THE best for someone living with depression because it made me feel like someone else has been through and lived through the same horrors that I have."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Yoga game - it's great","review":"The More Yoga game is great, you can play it with a group of people or solo.

Even The Kovenant's new material is outdated. Nagash (aka Lex Icon) needs to learn how to write for the future, not what's popular right now. because by the time it gets out to the market, everybody's already been there, done that.

To call this redundant would be a vast understatement. Avoid at all costs unless you are a pretentious metal head that seeks a poorly performed classical element in your metal to make you appear cultured and elite. Feces. I wish I didnt have to give it 1 star but amazon.com requires it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reinforcing my new respect and enjoyment of black metal","review":"What can I say, this album is fantastic. The amazing guitar work, the way the synth/piano compliments the music, Hellhammer's drumwork is OUTSTANDING and the operatic vocals...wow, this record is a masterpiece, I recommend this to any fan of any kind of metal, because it's cohesive enough to work as a gateway and strong enough to leave a legendary mark in the world of black metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like No Other Band","review":"If you like classic Cradle Of Filth and Dimmu Borgir's Puritanical Euphoric Misanthropy & Death Cult Armageddon albums (Like Many Do), You will love this album. The Kovenant put more emphasis on the lead guitar in this album. There are a lot of solos. This is my personal favorite from The Kovenant. Animatronic was very good, too, but this album is less electronic and much darker. The word is that The Kovenant's new album is supposed to be more similiar to Nexus Polaris and Animatronic than Seti, which I am very happy about. I like Seti but I like the other two much much better. Buy it, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"title","review":"to clear something up quick, this band is NOT the same band as Covenant. Apparently that 'The' makes all the difference. While both bands are very cool, they're both very different. This is black metal, the other Covenant is more along the lines of Front242-style industrial. This band recently gave themselves a makeover and put out an album as The Kovenant. Personally, i think what they're doing now is much better. They've still got the same heavy feel, but they've grown a lot. They throw a German opera singer in there to do some backing, and surprisingly enough, it adds a lot to the feel of the music. Also, there's a bit more synth on that album. While this is a good album, and i do enjoy it a lot, Kovenant gets 5 stars, while this gets 4."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bizarre...","review":"Ayant lu 'Folle', j'ai voulu lire 'putain' et je dois dire que j'ai été déue.

I really enjoyed tracks 1,8 and 9-19, but I was disappointed that so much instumental music from the movie was left out. I thought that the techno tracks were too long, repetitive, and frankly irritating. I do like some techno, but this was bad techno. I think that this soundtrack should have been released as two separate CDs. One with the techno, and one with the instrumental music, like the Batman releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelous solo debut but do beware.","review":"\\"Pacific Coast Highway\\" was recorded in January of 1991 and was released shortly thereafter. Those who enjoyed his music with Tangerine Dream can forget about getting any of the dynamics. Instead, expect a very beautiful adventure with haunting, almost romantic sounds ranging from the sunny Pacific Mood of \\"Wheels on The Beach Park\\", \\"Big Sur Romance\\" and \\"Driving Into Blue\\". On the other hand, the album takes a much more dramatic direction with \\"Lontano Mystery\\", \\"Black Garden View\\" and \\"Cinnamon Park\\".This album though was re-issued a few years later as \\"Enchanting Nature\\" with some of the tracks moved there and others altered, and the remaining actually unchanged except in their titles. If you have \\"Enchanting Nature\\", you decide if it is necessary to purchase \\"Pacific Coast Highway\\". I happen to have both and have no regrets about it then again it may as well be more of a completist mentality on my part."},{"rating":"2","title":"PCH=Perfection","review":"This is to me the most complete album he or any new age artist has ever manufactured.

This album is the real stuff. \\"Black Garden View\\" is the most relaxing and elegant song ever created...PERIOD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SIMPLY OUTSTANDING","review":"This has quite simply got to be one of the best new age recordings ever made. Chris Franke's experience working with Tangerine Dream until 1987 is very evident in this album. But, that is not to take away the credit for all the extraordinary compositions. Purple Waves is without doubt the best track on this CD. Others are equally impressive. It's high time that Chris forgets his film work & returns to some quality studio work. A sequel to this album would be ideal in the 21st century."},{"rating":"1","title":"Northanger Abbey","review":"If you were nurtured on the original recording by Anna Massey, prepare for great disappointment.

Well 2.8mm is .113 and 3.3mm is .131.I used both Grip Rite 3-1/4 x .131 coated nails and DuoFast 3-1/4 x .131 HD Galv nails and both worked great.The Grip Rite nails would fall right into the magazine, but the DuoFast had to have a slight push to get in and then they slid down the magazine fine. The amount of push was maybe 1-2oz. of thumb pressure so it was no big deal.I would reccommed this gun to any homwowner/handyman that has occassional need of a framing nailer.

The story line between Grace and the soldier, although romantic, left me feeling a little confused. Although it was obvious John was not the right man for her, the way Grace ended up with the soldier left me feeling as though I'd missed a chapter or two somewhere.

Also, the pictures themselves this year just lacked something. Don't get me wrong, the dogs are all adorable.

A wind rip is one thing but with this tarp the material simply crumbles to the touch, something that I've never had happen in less than 20 months before!This is in a shaded area no less!

However, the millions of readers who know no Arabic at all will likely find this to be the most readable, insightful, and hopefully inspiring English translation of The Holy Qur'an. Personally, as I unfortunately seem to have no facility whatsoever for other languages besides English, Ahmed Ali's translation has served me well as a guide to a greater and deeper understanding of a faith and way of life of which I would otherwise know virtually nothing. As the best translators know, absolute accuracy of translation is irrelevant if the end product is clumsy and unnecessarily difficult. I am not in a position to determine whether Ahmed Ali's translation is entirely accurate -- I must leave that task to great masters of scholarship -- but I do know what I like, and the elegant English is simply superb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really just a bunch of nonsense.","review":"I bought this book for one specific reason and one reason only, to light it ablaze.

We hit the local toy store and when she saw the My Scene Barbie Juicy Bling: Kennedy doll, she had to have it. The doll comes with a purse, cellphone, hair pick, hair gems and two applicators (one pretend one for the doll to hold and a real one for your child to use on the doll or herself). The gems can be put in either the child's or the doll's hair (or in the case of my daughter, my hair). The applicator works reasonably well considering that it is a toy but I must warn parents that the gems are very small and will most likely go missing sooner or later.The doll's outfit is current with the times (I'm no fashion critic) and my daughter loves the overall look of the doll. If you have a young daughter who's into fashion, this Juicy Bling: Kennedy doll is perfect for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hand Waving and Puffery","review":"The book can be summarized in 11 words: \\"Genetic fractal neural fuzzy chaotic nonlinear stuff good.

Click on \\"read and excerpt\\" and try to make yourself read it all the way through.) Which would have been good, if it were all done in context, but context in this book can be hard to find.

The author keeps repeating the same things over and over again. At the same time, it is more or less obvious that the author either doesn't fully understand nonlinear dynamics or didn't know how to explain this subject in a more rigorous way. Sometimes, the author seems to be carried away by mysticism as if nonlinear dynamics had anything to do with religion or gods.If you want to read a good introductory book about complexity theory, read John H.

When I rolled over at night, I got the sensation that whole thing was going to roll over, which of course it never did. But I did learn to stay in the middle of the bed to prevent that sensation. I slept on it for five days. Deflating it, and rolling it up for storage was easier than I thought.

It's raised to a good height, and another good thing about it is that it has linear ridges instead of ovals that other beds have (I think the straight lines are more comfortable than the ovals, and the ovals increase the number of seams where air can leak). Easy to inflate and deflate, although i haven't tried to fit it into the provided bag.I've had to inflate it once in the month I've had it (in addition to the initial fill), although I can imagine it being more if you really like a firm mattress. It does lose air slowly, although it's not such a huge issue to me to refill every few days.

As you can imagine highly disappointed the product went back in the box and it's sitting on the shelf. I want to use the product but it was not sold as advertised and no where on the site does it mention that the gloves are a large size. This product doesn't cater for small women's hands.

I was not over weight to begin with I only wanted to lose about ten ponds and tone up, it did not do this for me. I am very disappointed in this product. While Billy is very motivational, the product it's self also has many flaws. I am 5 foot even, the bands were too long and I could not put and real strain on the bands. Secondly the gloves that came with it were also entirely too big and slid off of my wrists. There is no way to adjust the bands or the gloves to your body's needs. There are also no instructions on how to properly connect the place the bands and the Velcro foot bands stuck to my carpet when I was trying to work out. The entire work out made me feel like I was a marionette. Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it seems to be...","review":"I am not particularly satisfied with this product for two reasons. First, this is Tae Bo and nothing more. The videos did not give me a great workout. I would do two workouts back to back to get a better work out. I was hoping for something much more strenuous. The videos were professionally done and I am satisfied with that, however I am basing my opinion on the workout itself. Second, the fitness bands provided were not great. The velcro footband does not stay fastened well. There should be a buckle there versus a thin velcro piece. I fixed this by using a fitness band, tying it in a loop to put around my foot and attaching the fitness bands to them.I think if you like Tae Bo you'll like this program. If you are looking for something more like P90X or Insanity don't waste your money. This is just my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG Disappointment!","review":"I was sooo excited to try this program out! I was under the impression that it would be just like any other Tae Bo workout, only with the addition of the bands to give you a resistance workout at the same time. WRONG! Some of the workouts don't include even a single kick! Sometimes the workouts focus only on the bands, performing movements like you would if you were using free weights. The worst part is that in all 7 workouts, I never got that uniquely Tae Bo glute burn (which is what I was most looking forward to). The only upsides are that the workouts are only 30 minutes, and let you know when you are 50%, 75% and 85% done. I wish I could have just bought the bands to do with my original Tea Bo videos and skipped the PT24/7 videos all together!

Some of the dialogue is truly funny which is to be expected since the book features an extremely dense heroine. The horse information is well realized and the small equine world the writer creates is a fine place to visit. Although other writers can perhaps do both the writing and the mystery better, it is still a very entertaining read. Horse lovers will rejoice in the horse element and other readers will simply be amused at the sheer denseness of the heroine.

It surveys the then new field of making thin films by using pulses of high intensity laser light. The papers are written by experts in these methods.Nucleation dynamics and how a film can grow under deposition pulses are explained in one chapter.Several chapters also discuss the related subject of laser-induced ablation of surfaces. Studies are summarised of the characteristics of the ablated material. In some ways, ablation can be considered the inverse process to deposition.One attraction of the deposition methods is to apply these in the construction of high temperature superconducting films. Typically, these are complex oxides, of 4 or more elements. The commercial viability of these materials depends in no small part on being able to manufacture them cheaply. The book has a chapter expanding on the praticality of this application."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great set for the money","review":"I bought this set after it was recommended in one of my magazines as a top value tool. Honestly, I have not owned any forstner bits before, so I have nothing to compare them with. I am quite pleased with them so far. I've used several of the bits, including the largest in the set, a couple of the smallest, and a few in the middle. Most of the work I've done with them has been in hard maple or MDF. They all cut a very nice clean hole, don't burn, and push the removed material out of the way well.I did have the same issue that someone else mentioned where the cardboard outer sleeve was stuck to the wooden case.Overall, I recommend these, especially if you're like me and needed a decent set to get started."},{"rating":"2","title":"forstner bits","review":"The set is a good deal for the price althought the packaging is a bit crude.

Yes, I love the show, but there just isn't anything new here that gives me any reason to believe I can succeed long term. Eat less exercise more...if it was that simple I wouldn't need a book. I need help with a lifestyle adjustment that can really work for me and counting calories never worked for me and it seems like it doesn't work for most people."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm fat not stupid","review":"Not a new piece of information in the book. Telling me to eat less and exercise more is not information I was looking for. I was very disappointed in this book and the DVD.

Bob Harper did not actually write the book, he only wrote the forward.As for the diet plan, there really isn't one. It's really just a series of anecdotes from the contestants. If that's what your interested in then then I suppose it's worth the read, but if you are looking for a book about weight loss don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"bits and bobs","review":"I bought this book because it was advertised as Bob Harpers book. Needless to say, it's not. It isn't Jillian Michaels book either. The book is fun and there are lots of pictures of Bob, but no real weight loss advice that amounts to a program of any kind. I like the book because I am a fan of the show and it does have some motivational anecdotes, but I wouldn't recommend it as a weight loss plan."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointed","review":"I ordered this book months ago as a pre-sale. I think it is good if you are a fan of the show looking to learn more about the contestants and their personal trials and tribulations. If you are someone looking for weight loss advice this book is as void of that as the actual show. It is very story heavy and lacks any real information. What little information it does provide in the way of diet and exercise is overly simplified and generic. At the end of the day, it was interesting to read the contestants anecdotes, but dissapointing as a source of information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip Off","review":"This book isn't what it claims to be.

For a 200 pound person that means 1400 calories a day. This might be OK for an average weight but I am not sure if the formula is proper for very heavy or very light people. So, from that point of view I find this book not very scientific. On the other hand the exercise plan suggested in the book is pretty reasonable. There are also a lot of other good advice that will help you take a long term control of you weight and will result in a good health: stay away from sugar (except for natural sugars contained in fruits), eat salad before each meal, exercise, and so on. For much more comprehensive advice on adopting healthy lifestyle, resulting in permanent weight loss I rather recommend Can We Live 150? by M. Tombak.

Also, the metal is very thin, it bends very easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"BE AWARE - this item is not really a frame!","review":"I had read other reviews noting that some plates were too large for this frame or rim. I figured that would not be a problem since I thought I would just trim the license plates to fit, which I did with no problem. The problem is that this item is not a frame at all. To me, a frame would go AROUND the license plate edges, like a picture frame goes around the glass and whatever is being framed. However, this so-called \\"frame\\" has the inside and outside edges that are the same depth. It is really just a 5/16 inch black bead that sits on the front of the license plate - leaving the edges of the plate exposed. It is well-made and well-finished, and would look very nice if it really was a frame and covered the license plate edges.I ordered two and didn't try to return them since the shipping cost to return would have been almost as much as the cost of the 2 frames."},{"rating":"2","title":"Look great","review":"It is amazing how many people drive nice cars, but have marred them with horrible looking license plate mounting jobs. It is so easy to do it well. Buy a set of these thin, black frames. (Note - check your license plate brackets first to make sure you can use frames with them. Especially the front plate.) Then use *four* *black* screws to screw them in. Align the screw slots for that final obsessive-compulsive touch.I like these Cruiser frames because they are extremely thin, made of metal, and have a nice black finish that will last a long time. They fit where other frames won't. I knocked one star off the review because, as others have noted, they could have been a mm or two taller. As it is though, when you tighten them down, things will flatten slightly and the plate edges should just tuck inside. If not, make sure the excess sticks out the bottom so no one will notice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless.....","review":"What good is it when it's smaller than a license plate? This is true for California plates, isn't the size standard. Also Amazon doesn't state for all the license plates whether one or two come in an order. I had assumed two since two are required. I received one, so be advised. I've returned it. Atleast Amazon makes that simple."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slim","review":"The license plate frame is as promised very slim.

Provides a finished look to the rear of any car."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too small for the plate","review":"Instead of fitting around the plate, it sits on top of it. And the corners of the plate stick out beyond the edge of the frame. Looks awful. Clearly the manufacture does not know the size of an American license plate. Cruiser Accessories should be ashamed of themselves for peddling a product like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice-looking frame but too small for Washington State, maybe others...?","review":"These folks make a nice frame, but this did not fit -around- the whole plate, and the holes did not match up.

However, this is a riveting film and the young star who plays Osama is haunting in her protrayal. I watched this film in amazement as I am familiar with the hardships of women in a Taliban Afghanistan, but this film brought those horrors (really) to light and life. I found the filming engaging. It did not drag for me. The scenes where Osama has been taken to the Taliban sponsored boys school kept me on edge, particulary the bath scene. I will not give away the ending but it was better than I expected though not unsurprising.

We never got to know anyone on a personal level.The equality talk by the grandmother at the beginning of the movie was very forced. The whole reporter execution seemed kind of corny. I still don't understand the what the jump rope had to do with anything. The whole \\"Pass under the rainbow, and boys become girls, and girls become boys\\" was rather hollow. The story is too rushed together: She disguises herself as a boy, goes to work, goes to school, gets arrested, get enslaved into a marriage, in less than an hour and a half.

Everyone lived in fear whenever the mullah came to town to search their home, especially the one scene when Osama and her mother and grandmother attended a wedding , and while the music was playing, the mullah came and all the women had to put up their burkha (the tent like dresses with the screen) and act like they were mourning the loss of a relative, since music and pictures were forbidden in the Taliban.

I'm glad it was a rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Terrible....","review":"Terrible acting, a bunch of selfish people, unconvincing, often disturbing in parts. The message could have been presented in a far, far, far more artful and tasteful way without being Polyanna-ish. We home school our children and watch few movies anyway - glad we previewed it before we let them watch it.

I'm looking forward to seeing & hearing their thoughts, reactions and insights."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where the wild things are","review":"I would not suggest this movie for any age children. It is very violent and teaches children bad lessons about behavior and consequences for actions. The boy in the story is destructive and the wild things at one point tear each others limbs off. Not a good choice and very differernt from the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where the Wild Things Are - Scary!","review":"Our almost three year old was scared in parts of the movie.

It was horrible! The movie takes a 20 minute story and stretches it for 90 or so minutes. In the end, you walk away wishing you could get a refund. My advice, rent before you purchase if you just must see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing For Me To Like","review":"To start off, I never read the source material for this movie, and I went and saw it on the whim of a couple friends. So I had no expectations going in. But when I sat down to watch, what was supposed to be a light-hearted imaginative romp (my presumptions based on commercials) just ended up being the kid walking around the forest with this mopey, depressed giant creatures that were always bickering and becoming caught up in petty nothings. And every time they started having fun in some way, one of them popped up to start drama and ruin everybody's good time. And then the kid goes home essentially the same person. He doesn't seem to have been affected by the experience at all.And to his credit, maybe it's good he didn't pick up anything from those disturbed things.Look for something by Miyazaki in stead."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a kids movie?","review":"Lets set aside that this was a bad movie to begin with as well as a horribly written script adaptation from a cool book. This was not made for kids. Any kid who was not asking a dozen questions afterwords needs some psychiatric help. I sat in the theater and wondered how I was going to explain this when it was over. It's easier with other movies where I can just make it clear that the things aren't real and that there aren't going to be any monsters coming out of the woods to eat you like in Spiderwick. I had to explain emotions and sensitivity with this one. I'm kind of big on not making movies out of books, and this is an awesome reason why."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be the worst movie ever","review":"This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen.

Personally, I don't give a damn. What bothers me is the insipid dialoge, the off-putting plot, and the annoying \\"monsters\\". The only way this movie would be appealing is if you turn off the talking, just have the music and the visuals. That was the only part of this movie I didn't hate."},{"rating":"1","title":"GET ME THE H-E Double hockey sticks OUT OF HERE!","review":"I would rather sit through a painful root canal than to sit through the agonizing boredom I experienced watching this film. Even the children next to me at the theater were bored to tears, and one was even playing on his Nintendo (I don't blame him in the least). I really tried to give this film a chance (and the snooty discerning indie side of me wanted to love it), but after 30 minutes, I wanted to shove my head in my tub of popcorn and suffocate my self to death."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible movie","review":"I do not watch movies that often, and this one reminded me why. This was without a doubt one of the worst movies I have seen in a very long time. That kid is a huge unsympathetic brat that just needed some good strong discipline and maybe some Ritalin. I watched it with two other adults and two 10-year olds, and not one us understood it, or enjoyed it any way. I laughed once the entire movie, the rest of the time spent wondering what was going on, and what kind of mommy and daddy issues the director and producer had. This is nothing like the book with the exception that the monsters (physically) appear to be faithfully rendered."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst \\"children\\" movie I've ever watched","review":"Basically, none of use \\"got\\" this movie.

I have a 5 & 6 year old and turned it off as soon as the horrible child behavior came on.Dont even think about it for kids under 13. And even then it is awful. I would have given it zero stars if I could. Its getting returned tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible adaptation from book to silver screen","review":"A mindless mess that should have been geared toward younger children but wasn't geared toward any specific age group.

I had to take my 4-year old who loves the book, crying from the movie. He had a million questions about why they were all so mean to each other and why didn't Max's room turn into a forest and why they said bad things their friends.Don't make my mistake - avoid this movie like the plague. This movie has no redeeming value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spoiled Brat","review":"Never read the book, but the movie tries way too hard to be indie.

Not worth your time..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant story for 10+","review":"This version of an old story is very touching and would be great for parents to sit down with their children to watch. You can see the effects of bullying and the withdrawal into a fantacy world along with the coping stratagies used. A fantastic film to watch for the 10+"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointing","review":"The main problem with \\"Where the Wild Things Are\\" is that it attempts to be too realistic and deal with too much of Max's life. The book was a whimsical foray into a single event in Max's imagination, not an overblown examination of childhood misery. I usually enjoy this type of film and overlook a lot of weaknesses in a fantasy film; I couldn't even watch all of this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great move","review":"This is a movie my kids loved and I would recommend it to anyone that grew up with the book and wants to introduce it to a new generation"},{"rating":"1","title":"?????","review":"This movie was a big disappointment.

I paid too much. The whole movie is about him throwing a tantrum and then getting away with it. There is nothing redeeming about this one. A big waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I almost walked out of the movie.","review":"Sorry, but this was one of the worst movies I've seen. It was slow, corny, and just plain boring to watch. There wasn't much of a plot and the characters were just, blah. I didn't expect a full length movie to follow a short childrens book 100%, but if you're a fan of the book at all, avoid this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snorefest","review":"This was not a book I grew up with, or even knew about until the film was released (was not popular where i lived), and it sounded very intriguing. So got the book, and was very surprised at how short it was ! Now the film sounded even more worth watching.Good credit for the young actors to pull off a believeable performance using this very long, drawn-out script. The imagination spark in the story was lost to an overly bloated wild thing community who were given no character.This film is extremely boring and tedious. Unless you're a film critic student, give this a miss.Avoided 1* as the animation and acting was good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever","review":"Worst movie ever... dark, creepy, disturbing... such a strange film that I had to write a review to let everyone know how bad this film is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass.","review":"The words of this book would barely fit on a few pages. As a result the movie just didn't work too well. I get the anger issues between the boy and his favorite monster but other than that this really wasn't terribly interesting. MY GRADE: C minus to C."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time/money","review":"I love this book, but I was curious as to how they were going to fill 90 minutes on screen. I found out how ... they made up a lot of really boring child angst garbage and turned this classic funny kids book into some warped exploration of how divorce effects kids. Who cares? Certainly not my 9 year old who kept wondering when the monsters were going to be entertaining and funny. I sat in that movie theater just squirming in my seat wanting the dumb thing to hurry up and be over! It was excruciating. The special effects were horrendous, I could have done better with my cell phone. And as far as the plot itself, there is no resolution, it just peters out there at the end and you get no answers to any of your questions, but on the positive side, you just don't care anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst movie of all time.","review":"I hated this movie. 1st off you cant expect to take a short children's story and make it into a full feature film and still have the same charm and magical effect as the book. They took A LOT of artistic liberties and ended up making a children's book in to a hipster art school college type of movie. I felt the movie was a way too dark for it to be considered a children's movie. The \\"wild things\\" were constantly threatening (in a sinister way) to eat the little boy \\"Max\\" and then a character's arms are torn off. You would think because they had all this extra time to fill stuff in the movie they would have done a better job writing a story that went some where. No problems where resolved! The kid was a cry baby brat in the beginning and a brat in the end as well. I probably hated the sound track most of all. That \\"All is Love\\" song makes my ears bleed its so awful. To summarize the worst movie EVER it ruined the book for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie Ever!!","review":"This is the worst movie I have ever seen. Max is a brat, he's so selfish and mean. He doesn't even say goodbye to Carol. That's just plain selfish! It's also pretty disgusting when Max goes into K.W.'s mouth. Yuck! And, if you've never seen this movie before, save you're money and rent it from Blockbuster if you have to see it. Half the time I didn't even know what was going on in the movie! This is totally something for parents. Why should kids watch a movie that's just going to teach them how to behave badly?! What's up with that?! I do not recommend this movie to anyone. The book is much better..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where the Wild Things Are","review":"My grandchildren and I liked the characters, but the story, the movement of the movie, where not entertaining.

Sorry...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I give it Minus Stars","review":"Thought the movie would be a fun one to watch with kids. It could have been and still made the points I'm guessing they wanted to make. One of the worst movies I have ever watched and I made myself watch all of it just to see if it would get better. NEVER did! It will find the trash can!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an interesting twist","review":"Clearly, Spike Jones had to add a lot to the tale to make this simple book into a movie, but the story felt bloated and uninteresting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Very disappointed with this movie, my daughter lost interest right away and so did I but we watched it anyways...it never got better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"Don't waste your time or money on this one. The only thing this movie clearly portrayed was that that is how rough and out of control boys behave. Way too much effort was placed on negative aspects, and very little if anything towards anything positive. You have to dig pretty deep for any meaning symbolic or otherwise. A real let down for ALL ages. The ONLY think I enjoyed was the facial expressions of the \`wild things'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrgh... my kids hated it.","review":"I was hoping for a half hour or so to get stuff done, but the kids didn't last 10 minutes with this DVD.

I love the book when I was little and this movie was a HUGE disapointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I purchased this movie thinking it would be a wonderful watching experience. I was very very disappointed. The movie was jerky, and the story was more than confusing, and the ending rediculous. I would not recommend this movie to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"surprised","review":"I've read this book to my daughter and my grandchildren and we loved it. I was so surprised how bad the movie is. The violence and anger they portrayed for the boy was too much. I'm sorry I ever bought this movie and I certainly will not share it with the children."},{"rating":"1","title":"What did they do to this children's classic?!!","review":"This movie was just awful! I loved the book, who didn't, but they took Max who was an impish high spirited boy in the book and turned him into a maladjusted even violent messed up kid who (small spoiler coming) bites his own mother! In the movie, Max didn't just need a time out, he needs a therapist. I got this for my grandson but viewed it first to be sure it was appropriate and I am sure glad I did. Needless to say my grandson won't be getting the movie. Another case of \\"Hollywood\\" not getting the difference between mischievous and malicious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this really a children's film?","review":"The puppetry is stunning, the effects are amazing, the child actor is really great... but the movie is depressing! I watched the movie just to be sure it is appropriate for my neice and found the story uncaptivating, boring and sad. I made the mistake of purchasing the dvd and will sell it ASAP. Spike Jonze is a very talanted director, but this isn't one of his best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a movie for kids...","review":"I was so disappointed in this movie. It is totally inappropriate for any child under the age of 13, which is certainly ridiculous considering the book content appealing to all ages. The animated costumes were incredibly realistic, but that is not why I bought the movie. I wanted a story with a good message, but you won't find it in this movie. It was so painful to watch that I only made it half way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally strange & violent","review":"I've never read the book but from what I know it's a very good popular book. If the book is anything like the movie I'm a little scared that children have been reading this. First off the movie is just plain weird. Second off it's so violent I couldn't believe it would be for children. All they do throughout the movie is smash and break things, beat each other up, one even gets his arm ripped off. We watched this w/ our 7 yr old and we were just shocked. We had to keep giving her good moral lessons like \\"that wasn't nice what he did\\". Would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Without a doubt, the most boring movie ever made. We bought this for our grandchildren to watch - - within 40 minutes, the DVD and packaging material was in our recycle bin. The visual effects are incredible, but not enough to sustain this story - the \\"monsters\\" are for the most part sympathetic characters, but after a fairly interesting start showing an emotionally troubled young boy in serious conflict with his mother and sister, he finds -imagines-daydreams- himself on an island populated with monsters who are a pretty tame bunch. At that point, the movie shifts into low gear and drags on from there. I wouldn't waste the money to even rent this disappointing movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe the worst movie I have ever seen.","review":"I can not believe that the first two reviews on Amazon came up as 5 star for the movie. Check the numbers and you will see that far more people rate it a 1 star than a 5. So much has been covered in the other 1 star reviews that I won't repeat it. I'll just summarize and say that turning a short childrens classic in to a long drudgery that explores dysfunctional families and personality disorders should have been stopped somewhere along the line. If you want to be bored and depressed, rent the Piano - at least is it was honest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"My seven year-old son and I checked this movie out at the library. We were very excited to watch it together. Half-way through the film my son announces, \\"Mommy this is the worse movie ever...I'd rather watch the Ram's play football (his least favorite team in the NFL) than to continue watching this.\\" Then the most amazing thing happened...something I'd never experienced before...something that prompted me to immediately write this review...my son, wide-awake, stood up...and volunteered to go to bed!Look this movie is 1 star at best. Nevertheless don't count it out so quickly. Sleep aid or discipline...kids bouncing off the walls, pop in this movie...kids getting a little out of hand, pop in this movie! Bad movie...great aid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE","review":"I honestly don't know what people see in this film that makes them like it. I mean, I get that everyone has different tastes yada yada yada, but this movie was so BORING. It had a terribly slow pace. I also have never disliked a lead actor as much as I did with this movie. He was unbearable. I cared nothing for his character and thus found myself completely not caring about the outcome of the movie. And honestly, what is the message of the movie? That an inconsiderate, undisciplined child can torture his mother to the point of ruining her life, go to a magical land, learn nothing, then come back and everything is okay?? Seriously??Two thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, implausible, and pointless","review":"I guess that the filmmakers want us to think that this is a deep exploration of a young kid who's misunderstood and dealing with some sort of emotional issues, but the reality is that it's a story of a spoiled kid who dreams about some of the most boring creatures imaginable. There's nothing to latch onto here--no sympathy for any of the characters (except the poor mom, but we don't see enough of her), no plot that we can watch develop, no character development that we can relate to. And how could they possibly think that an ending with no words between the kid and his mom is going to be effective? This kid hasn't learned a thing. It's simply a boring, plotless two hours of drivel--easily one of the worst films that I've ever seen. Save yourself the time and energy, and read the book--it'll take five minutes and will be much more satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"A movie so obsessed with being cool, it neglected to tell a story","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this adaptation of a book I loved as a child--and even now as a parent reading to my children. Being familiar with Spike Jonze, I was not expecting a Disney movie; I was just hoping for an inventive movie loosely inspired by a classic story of imagination. That was obviously the plan, but then things went terribly wrong. There is just no magic here, at all. It is a movie so obsessed with being cool, that it neglected to tell a story. At times it even wandered into the forced sentimentality of a greeting card commercial. I guess I am just not cool enough to get the irony."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing and Humorless","review":"Normally I really like this kind of thing but I just found I had no empathy for anybody (or thing) in this film which made it hard to enjoy. The humor (what of it there was) I found either disturbing or just not funny, it may have worked if this had been made an animated feature, but in live action it's just not working for me, especially (spoiler alert!) where the one thing got it's arm torn off. Yikes! That was followed shortly by pretty much the only good line in the movie though...In short, I can't recommend this to anyone. Go read the kids book again. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Art Film","review":"This is a wonderful coming of age film. That being said, it is not for the causal film watcher wanting a feel good movie, or for children either. This is a movie about life and the monsters that are within all of us. If you enjoy analyzing films or are a film student, I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad movie","review":"I don't mind sad children's movies. I do, however, want some glimmer of hope or redemption at the end, which this movie did not offer. Max is an obviously troubled child who should be getting lots of attention and guidance at home, which he is not. One night after acting out and getting in trouble, he runs away to a desolate island of his mind and encounters several monsters, each representing various aspects of his own emotions. These monsters are constantly in conflict, just as the feelings within Max. He tries to be their king to bring some order to these unhappy monsters but without success. He finally abandons the miserable creatures to return home, which seems to indicate that he is unable to cope with his own inner turmoil and has given up. The sight of these pathetic monsters crying and watching Max leave left me feeling very sad and troubled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Behind the scenes videos were much more entertaining","review":"After watching behind the scenes videos, and seeing all those kids on the set, I did understand the intention of people who made this movie. The idea was great, the delivery....is another story. First of all, all the yelling and screaming and crying of the main character at the beginning of this movie was by very least disturbing, and autistic like. Then when he got to the land with all these furry creatures, it was evidently a personally psychological battle. So to call it a movie for children one cannot. Perhaps very little children would find it amusing, but certainly without truly scary and disturbing beginning. Again the idea was great, but what came out, should be a part of the curriculum in a school of psychiatry, but not as an entertainment piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"It was horrible the voices they chose were bad, just overall, it was so disappointing. I was bummed that I bought it instead of renting it. Even my kids didn't like it...except one of them (out of the 5 of us only 1 of us liked it)"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT buy this video for your child!!","review":"Upon viewing this movie, my 10 year-old son became very upset and was totally disgusted with the movie. He felt that the movie is nothing like the book he has loved all of his life. It shows extreme violence and disrespect, not only from the monsters, but also from Max. No Child needs to view this. I really wonder who approved this project to animate a child's classic in this disgusting way. Someone owes Maurice Sendak a big apology. Do yourself a favor and do not buy this for your child."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most BORING movies of all time","review":"OMG, sooooooo boring. And the main bear is bipolar. Not worth any of your time, buy something that is actually worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!

My kids like the book, but the movie kept them interested for <5 minutes. Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Count me in the one star group","review":"It is obvious from looking at the reviews that this is a love it or hate it movie. Personally, this is a big waste of my time (and I would suggest yours) movie.

I knew I wouldn't like it when the first preview is an ad for the video game that will result - hmmm - for the same reason I didn't like the 3rd Pirates of the Caribbean movie.When we all sit down, as a family, to watch a movie, it should be fun and entertaining. We turned this one off after 10 minutes of watching this way-too-common scenario. The kid doesn't have a Dad around - we get it! What child wouldn't act like a monster? Proof that it is way too hard to make a \\"good\\" feature-length film from a 5 minute book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie I've ever seen","review":"Unfortunatley I had to give one star to this crappy movie and as I have seen I'm not the only one who feels the same way that I doThis Movie sucks.

Don't waste your time and money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was that?","review":"Just finished watching Where the Wild Things are on DVD and I didn't get it at all. My kids 5 & 9 lasted for about 15 minutes and they bailed to go play in their rooms. I stuck it out since I paid for the movie. They seemed to be trying to get some kind of a message across, trying to make a connection with something abstract in the kid's phyche, but I didn't get it, my kids didn't get it and none of us could detect any plot. Late in the movie his beast friends get a little violent and one eats him. She does cough him back up, but a bit disturbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautifully filmed/Not interesting for younger children","review":"I watched this with my 7- and 2-yr-old sons. They love the book. The movie was artistically filmed and the 'wild things' were well done, but the plot/lines where not for them. The deeper psychological interactions were above them, and both were bored within the first 20 minutes. We turned it off halfway through. Unlike other new movies I've brought home, they didn't ask to watch it a second time. I titled my review as 'not interesting for younger children' but honestly beyond the appreciation for the filming, the movie didn't interest me either."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the melancholy best of 2010","review":"2010 was a great year for melancholy films (A SINGLE MAN being another great film).

The part where Max is with the \\"Wild Things\\" is kind of drawn out and pointless. Not to mention awkward. The beginning and the end are better but not by much. I don't think a child could gain anything from watching this movie in terms of an overall message, and it was too slowly paced to really entertain.Overall, I think adults who enjoyed the book as a child would enjoy this movie the most, and that isn't much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nietzschian Emptiness...

We had so much hope for it!We watched it with our kids and several nieces and nephews and it didn't take long before ALL of the young kids asked to leave and even the preteens said \\"this is super boring and depressing\\".I soldiered on hoping that there was treasure to be unearthed or revealed - something to reward those who slogged on through the muck to finish the film. Nope.At the end, I felt like Wesley in the Princess Bride after the 6 fingered man says \\"I just sucked 5 years of your life away.

Horrible little boy learns about just how horrible he has been and goes home to eat cake. I just wish the main character, the boy, was at all likable. I hated him. He wasn't cute. He wasn't funny. He was obnoxious. From start to finish. You really have to turn your brain off while watching this movie. Or be under the influence of something. Some may think this is a deep, emotional, thought provoking movie but they're wrong. If you know someone with a horribly obnoxious child, ask yourself, would you want to watch a movie about them?I give it 2 stars because of the good special effects and decent but dull acting of the monsters. Also, when the mom threw her son on the floor after he bit her. I liked that part. I liked seeing him cry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where the wild things are...","review":"My boys (age 7 & 9) and myself (age 33) and my mother (age 60) all loved watching the movie together!

Movie is horrible. Not for kids at all. Story of a psycho kid, runs away... meets some psycho creatures. The whole time u r praying that it ends with a moral.

I agree with all of the other 1-star reviews. Unfortunately, we saw this in the theatre. I wish we would have just left- another family did. I was disgusted with the main character's behavior and horrified that my children witnessed it. The movie just got worse and worse. It was so bad and boring... I was looking for anything to do besides watch it. Sadly, I didn't have any sharp objects on my person with which to jab my eyes out. I love the book, and so do my kids, but this movie ruined it for me!! And my poor 5-year old hasn't asked me to read him the book since."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your time and money","review":"Just one word - others said it all - HORRIBLE!

She loves the book, may still be too young to enjoy the movie just yet. I have older grandchidren that love the movie so it was a great purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was just awful.","review":"I can see how this film is based on the book, but quite simply put, it was pathetically bad. The level of violence was not an issue, it was simply that the film made no sense and was a chaotic mishmash of scenes in which we are meant to feel for the poor, misunderstood Max. Other reviewers have said more and done it better, but I had to put in my two cents on this one as well. Don't waste your money unless you're a hipster who wants to be convinced that yet another object from your childhood can be converted into an art movie and remain worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing -- do not waste your money!","review":"I loved the book as a kid, and was excited to see the movie; my wife purchased it for me for my 48 birthday. I sat down to watch it with my wife and two boys, and both parents and children were disappointed. I couldn't wait for Max to sail back in his boat. Bottom line, if you have an advanced degree in psychology -- as it appears most of the person's who gave this movie a good review do -- and want to explore the deeper themes of the movie afterwards, then by all means, purchase this movie. On the other hand, if you want a to watch a movie that is easily understood and entertaining, then this movie is not for you.In any event, buyer beware, kids will NOT like this movie, and some of the scenarios in the movie are both violent and disturbing for children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"This movie touched me in all the ways the book did when I was young. It takes you for an emotional ride, but at the end you feel as if you understand each of those emotions a little better than before.Also - James Gandolfini needs to win best supporting actor for his role here."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING BORING AND MORE BORING","review":"I always wanted to watch this movie when it first came out but I decided to watch on DVD instead. Well I did and what a waste of time it was. I had no idea of what the movie was about. There no plot and the dialogs are boring and slow. Too bad I can't get 1.5 hrs back. Please don't buy this movie, find something else to buy instead.

Indeed an unforgettable journey.Now let's take this story and pillage all the color from the imagery and most of all, let's turn it into a Dr Phil psychosis episode about the difficulties of being a spoiled brat in a divorced upper middle class home.WTF?Yeah, Spike Jones pretty much took E.T. And turned Elliot into a post modern basket case brat in need of Ritalin. It's the same idea as if Larry Clark started out with a Sesame Street episode and that is how we got the movie \\"Kids.\\". Elmo became Telly. Put a different name on it and you have a better movie, but this ain't WTWTA.Avoid at all costs. It's that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wild things","review":"I bought this thinking it was a cartoon Something the kids would like to watch with us!You do not want your kids watching this film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Watched this movie today with my kids.

Jonze distorts Max into an aggressive Bleak Household ADHD-type single-parent-household casualty (mom smooching the new guy in the living room, indifferent sister, absent dad, and so on). It a fit of rage, Max paddles off to where the wild things are - the wild things being these menacing, depressing, detached, avoidant cases. We walked out halfway through the film; it was literally intolerable. DEFINITELY not for children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird","review":"This is a disturbing and weird movie. I do highly recommend NOT to watch it and definetely do not let your child watch this movie on its own."},{"rating":"1","title":"WILD, BUT NOT IN A GOOD WAY","review":"This movie features a manic child who is destructive and violent (bites his mother only 10 minutes into the film). He finds a fantasy world where everyone mopes around, harrasses, and nags each other, so his behavior is lauded. Not only does the hero need some serious behavioral modification, but the story itself was incredibly bleak and depressing. The Wild Things themselves are a bunch of curmudgeons who have nothing better to do than kvetch all day, and this movie had nothing positive to offer my kids or my family."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is a DOWNER!!!","review":"My special lady friend and I sat down to watch a contemporary adaptation of Maurice Sendak's classic book. We had a nice bottle of wine, some lovely cheese, a roaring fire... lots of pillows. The movie starts off well but as soon as you meet the monsters, you are in trouble. These are the lamest monsters off all time. They spend most of their time moping. The same way that a depressed alcoholic in a downward spiral mopes. They do this for two hours. Weak.The book was way better."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst.","review":"A friend brought this film over my house, and talked me into playing it. YUK! Boy am I sorry! I never remember reading the book or buying it for my kids when they were young. Anyway...A weird film about a spoiled kid who sails away to a far away land where a bunch of yukky looking dressed up animals/monsters/weirdos, (who knows?) whatever. They all talk and talk and talk and make no sense at all. The boy joins the escapade and they crown him a king. No idea why. Anyway, I never saw it to the end because it was so boring I fell asleep and I wasn't alone. My husband fell asleep too. Possibly another guest. Unless you like weird movies with no plot and no particular story, don't bother buying this film. It's awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"A review from a grandma","review":"My son's favorite book when he was a child was \\"Where the Wild Things Are\\" and I couldn't wait to get the movie for his children, aged 2 and 5. We watched it, together, but had to stop it half way through. It scared the kids and was very disappointing! It is not a story for young children and should be viewed by older children age 9 and up. The adult reviews say it is good because it was viewed by an ADULT! I think you have to be an adult to understand what's going on in the movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"they are boots - they work - get them","review":"Hard to review something as simple as CAT5 connector boots.

They don't feel cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Firm plastic boots, does it's job","review":"These strain relief boots do their job--only minor gripe (don't we all have them?) is that because the plastic is somewhat firm, it does take a little bit more 'effort' to depress the jack-release tab when pulling out your cable; otherwise, these are great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best, but they work well","review":"These are by no means the best boots. They are kinda firm but they work well and I cannot complain much, especially considering the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I often have to make my own cables of various lengths, and these \\"boots\\" help make the job better. They are easy to install, and do exactly what they are designed to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well on a variety of cables.","review":"I purchased these for the termination of a large number of cable runs and patch cables. They have fit well on every type of cable that I have used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too tight to work right - worthless","review":"After reading previous reviews of these strain relief boots, I thought they would be what I wanted. They arrived on time and appeared as advertised, but when put onto the cable ends they were too tight and permanently kept the clip locks depressed so that the clips were always in the release position and never stayed attached to the connection ports. This caused the cables to easily detach from their connection port. I ended up sliding the boots off of the clips so the clips would stay connected. This basically defeated the purpose of the boots and I will not use them on future cables. Fortunately they were not too expensive. The idea of them is good, but their actual performance is poor. Perhaps I got a bad batch of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tasting shake just include frozen fruit for a smoothie thickness.","review":"This is a great tasting shake and helps me maintain my weight despite the minor stress I have to endure ."},{"rating":"1","title":"This fan was crap","review":"Ordered this fan and installed it. Made things worse. And distracted me from diagnosing the problem. Which was the condenser fan after all. After several weeks and numerous additional troubleshooting steps, I discovered that this fan was running backwards. It was pushing hot engine compartment air through an even hotter radiator and then through the AC condenser. The AC did not work unless the car was moving. Big surprise. This unit either has the wrong motor or wrong blade. No deal here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic but very complicated.","review":"As far as cook books go this is a fantastic book to opt for. It ranges from delicate sauces to the most complex of deserts. This book has only two flaws which in a sense are not real flaws. The first is that this book is definately designed for the experienced cook. Though it offers an explantion of many of the complicated tasks in its recipes, there is a lot of knowledge it takes for granted. So while this book is definately not for the rank amateur, with a combination of other books this could be a fantastic referece book to own. As for the second flaw, the ingredients required are not always the easiest to find. Some of the things neccessary for the recipes can not be found in your everyday super-market. But if you have access to some specialized markets you will be cooking like a professional in no time at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"I never thought I'd say this but...","review":"Too much sex, too little emotional development between the characters. I bought all of McCarthy's work in one go and this was the first one I read. I think she's a refreshing author with her own voice so for that alone she gets my respect.Halfway through the book I had to put it down for a bit and I didn't really understand why - I was enjoying the read but then I realised I was on a sex train that only occasionally took character development pit stops. My brain was tired of the sex and as a result, I lost my connection with the characters or rather, my connection forged at the beginning of the novel wasn't allowed to grow.I mark this a 2/5 but I really mean 2.5 - and this is only because this author writes so much better (the proof is in her other titles) that in comparison to the others, it can't get higher than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Say Pass!","review":"I agree with Bee Smith's review that the protagonists of MOUTH TO MOUTH are a couple of shallow, sex-starved people. In this novel, Erin McCarthy failed with her character development. I wasn't emotionally involved in this story and could care less when Russ and Laurel screwed each other senseless while trying to catch a con man out on the loose. The sex scenes were overrated--explicit but NOT erotic. Although the mistaken choking scene with Russ and his younger brother was quite amusing, everything else was bland. I skimmed thru much of this novel and bottom line: Non-compelling characters + insipid romance + lackluster plot = one heck of a boring romance novel!Save your cash. There are far better romance novels out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"DIDN'T KEEP MY INTEREST","review":"When I read the description of the book about Russ - a cop with too much on his plate and Laurel - a hearing impaired potential victim in his current case, I thought it sounded like such a good read, but unfortunately it wasn't.The book had potential, but the writing didn't follow through with character development. Sure there was steamy sex, but when you can't care about the characters, you lose interest. It becomes just reading the words with no emotional pull. If I don't become involved in the story there isn't much point to it. This is a book I could put down, in fact it took 3 days to get through it. I hope the writer takes more care with the characters in her next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a porn movie","review":"This book reminded me of a porn movie; lots of sex but no plot and no character development. How did these two decide that they loved each other anyway? All they really seemed to know about each other was how to make the other climax. This was a real disappointment. I like steamy sex scenes too, but they have to be built around characters that I grow to care about and get to know. There was no romance in this book at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"2nd Read","review":"When I give a book a 5 star review, it's because I beleive I'd enjoy reading it again.Well, I've just re-read this and enjoyed it again.Fun.

I pre-ordered it so I would get it ASAP. And I was NOT disapointed! I read this book in less than 10 hours, and not because it was \\"an easy read\\". I loved everything about this book. The characters are wonderful and the plot keeps the story moving. The heroine's disability made me see the world from her eyes and I realized how much we take for granted. And the attraction/love between the 2 main characters is real, easy to believe and it makes you really care about them.If I could give this book more than 5 stars, I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummm, just not my taste, I guess...","review":"I'm not a prude and I want intimate scenes in my romance novels, but basically the sex begins on page 60 and continues on every other page until the end at page 287.

And at $14 a pop, I don't think I'll be giving her a second chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Romance, You will enjoy this book.","review":"Very sexy and exciting book.

So, the item was NEVER in stock (despite the fact that it STILL says it is in stock on this page!), and not only that, they never bothered to tell me so until I asked them.

I'd heard one of Susan Werner's songs, and it wasn't one from this album. When I received it, however, I couldn't stop listening to it. \\"Last of the Good Straight Girls\\" is realistic...with a cheerful twist. Werner's vocal talent is immediately apparent from the beginning of this first track. The album refuses to lose momentum as it goes on. \\"Still Believe\\" is beautiful and important, \\"Man I Used to Love\\" is strong and upbeat. \\"St.Marys of Regret\\" has brilliant lyrics. Must I go on? If you're seeking some great music from an incredibly talented woman, this album is definitely worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"stimulating but a bit workmanlike","review":"Kakar takes the reader deep into sexual ideas and lore, in the classical Indian way, that will certainly enlighten and even titillate some readers. His imaginative depiction of who the author of the Kama Sutra might have been is also worth the price of admission. His prose - this is his first novel, I think - often falls short of page-turning, but I happily stayed with it to the end nevertheless, and so will you if you're interested in a lively and stimulating depiction of the geography of desire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could be better...","review":"This is about the only test preparation book available for the American Foreign Service Officer's test, and it's a few years old. There was a major change in the '98 exam that this book doesn't cover, simply that the essay is given first thing on the day of the test, as opposed to the day of the interviews. To get more info, you should also splurge for the ETS test preparation guide also (about $11.00). It's another practice exam, like the ones in this book. More info can be found at the State Dept. website. Other than that, ARCO's book is necessary, but less than adequate. The suggested readings at the index will benefit a test taker more than the test itself. Maybe with an exam like this one, they figure that you either live on a diet of international relations or there's no hope for you. Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money.","review":"To reiterate the reviews already posted, this book is a waste of money.

I know the importance of having books that children can relate to and to have books that teach them how to handle things correctly but, showing a little girl passing gas and monsters shaped like buttocks...I think not. I would love to know if this author has ever sat down in an early childhood classroom and tried reading this book to young children??? Children emulate what they see and hear. Can't we give them something a little more concrete to go on then a father who make his little girl smell her own gas???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and Informative","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed (and continue to enjoy) this book. I am very new to wine and this book did an excellent job of destroying the fear everyone has regarding the subject. There are cartoons throughout the book that help to illustrate how silly it really is to be intimidated by the subject. This is not an in-depth or comprehensive guide to wine, and I certainly don't think the authors intended it to be one. What is has done for me is it taught me a little bit about the making of wine, the various grapes and regions, the labeling, matching with food and then basically told me that if I wanted to learn more, I should continue exploring other books and magazines. And that is what I'm beginning to do now. So this book will not teach you all you want or need to know, but it does a great job as an introductory course and continues to be a resource that I will refer back to again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent comi book","review":"I really enjoyed this work of art.

It's one of those movies that are still funny after almost twenty years.It's unfortunate Candy left us so soon. He had a lot of good movies left in him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Going Beserk","review":"I seem to be one of those people that can't stand to watch the same film twice in the same day, But there is one exception, GOING BESERK is a classic 80's comedy that I can't get enough of. The Great John Candy gives one of his best preformances playing the off the wall caracter john. Every thing was going all right for john untill he is brainwashed into killing his soon to be father-in-law. But when this fails and turns John into the worlds biggest prick, Johns not the only one with problems now. Eugene leavy co-stars making this wackiest role ever. In short if your a big fan of John Candy and his SCTV co-stars then this film will make you start GOING BESERK, but if your not a big fan of John Candy,SCTV, or 80'S movie's then this film may just drive you BESERK. All in all GOING BESERK is a film made in the same respects as many other 80's comedy's, to make you laugh, not to make money and win awards."},{"rating":"1","title":"The good, the bad, and the stupid","review":"The subtitle THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE STUPID appears on what seems to be the poster or C.D. box cover of the 1983 comedy GOING BERSERK. It's an apt summary of the film, which not often enough is good (as in funny) and too often bad or stupid. Fans of either the late, great John Candy or television's SECOND CITY TELEVISION will find GOING BERSERK worth a look for the antics of Candy and his S.C.T.V. cohorts Joe Flaherty and Eugene Levy.

I needed to find an emergency alert/reporting device which he could easily get to and use. After searching for quite a while, finding unit after unit with small alert buttons either on the base unit or on a remote pendant, I decided on this one due to the LARGE emergency button. The unit appears to work fine, but since my son also has speech impairment I needed a way to have it play back a pre-recorded message with his name, address and a brief summary of possible emergencies so that emergency services would know what that they were coming into a situation involving a disabled person who may not be able to answer the phone or open the door. This unit didn't offer custom message recording, but it does provide connections to wire up an external playback device. Once I get everything working right, I'll have a better idea about the reliability of this unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's ALL GOOD.","review":"LOVE IT!

It is clearer, more precise, and contains more information. This one manages to make simple concepts become quite difficult."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Terrible","review":"I hated using this book. It's organized differently from the course I took, so our readings were little passages, often less than 4 pages, scattered throughout the book. This is possibly the worst textbook I've ever tried to read. The text is boring and hard to get through. Most of my friends agreed that it was really hard to get through more than a few pages at a time of this. I thought the subject matter was boring, and that was why it was so hard to read, but then I bought the Alberts book, for my next molecular biology course, and I realized the problem was the author of this book. I also found the diagrams and page layout less than user friendly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worldview","review":"I am part way through the text at this point. It does offer a reasonably clear presentation of material. The author proffers a Darwinian (in the strong sense) world view which is stated repeatedly as fact with no substantive argument or scientific evidence. The CD is a nice addition but limited."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many authors undermine coherence","review":"This text is excellent in the coverage of its subject matter, but, like typical texts and journal articles written by a myriad of authors, it lacks coherence. Thus, separating the wheat from the chaff is tedious. The book, if well written, could be much shorter and more readable than it currently is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scatterbrained","review":"This book is so scattered and disjointed. Topics don't flow, random jumps are made, and the text is written poorly to top it off. If you're going to get a cell biology book, get Molecular Biology of the Cell, Fourth Edition by Bruce Alberts. Might be a bit thicker but for the same price you get much better information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Organized","review":"Prof. Lodish obviously knows his Biology, but his textbook is very poorly organized. The amount of information thrown in each section is random and excessive at times, convoluting the fundamental concepts being introduced. The illustrations were very good in portraying the basic concepts, but the text was very poorly organized. Not recommended as a good intro text for Cell Biology, even at the late undergrad level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok","review":"The beads are ok, i expected it to be a little 'fuller'.

Nobody involved could have thought that Ormandy's polite, rhythmically mild Appalachina Spring came close, and his Billy the Kid never hurt anyone in his life. But back then Ormandy was nearly as big a name with the record-buying public as Bernstein, and his fans wouldn't care. As a result, we get gorgeous playing frorm the orchestra and impactful sound--though not the best that Living Stereo has to offer--all in service of very dull performances.For me, the main attraction was hearing Edurdo Mata's contribution. This talented Mexican maestro died young, and I missed him the first time around. He conducts a lively four scenes from Copland's Rodeo ballet , by far the best thing here, but his El Salon Mexico (ironically for a native-born musician) sounds anemic next to Bernstein's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great collection","review":"This was a good deal for 6 Christmas movies.

While the sections on the politics of the Sea War tended to drag a little overall the book is an excellent summary of the major battles at sea during WWI. I rather hoped the sections on the submarines would be longer but the focus of the book was more on the dreadnoughts and battlecruisers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding narrative history","review":"<u>Castles of Steel</u> is an outstanding narrative history of naval planning, engagements, successes, failures, and government in The Great War. Highly recommended because of the lucid writing style, narrative pace, and excellent bibliography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great hiSTORY","review":"I read DREADNOUGHT by cahance a few years ago, and Peter the Great 12 years ago. Robert Massie writes about history. He tells a story, shines a light on individauls and illuminates an age,era or season. I have enjoyed his writing and his story telling for years, and this particular book greatly.Just how exciting can a ship chasing another be? With Massie, it is an encounter of persons and an age, it is not just the ships, but the ideas that made the ships, the ideals that forged them and the men that commanded and sailed them to that moment in time when the two ships met.An amazing and enjoyable read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Narrative - some bits missing","review":"It's hard to imagine a 900 page book is incomplete - but it is. The narrative is well written and very engaging, but I found myself using other resources such as an Atlas with better charts and the Internet during my reading to better understand what was happening in the battles. The book could have been improved by more and better maps [especially of Jutland - showing Jellicoe's turn, the German turnabouts and the German escape through the British wake]. A few tables incorporating sinkings and outcomes, and comparing ship types would have helped. What is the difference between an armored cruiser and a battle cruiser? Finally, a short epilogue indicating the ultimate ends of the the main characters [Jellicoe, Fisher, Beatty, the German admirals] would have tied things up nicely. It would have been nice to see Jellicoe's 1914 'tactics' letter in an appendix [I found it on the 'Net], etc. Excellent writing, but a few things like this would have topped it off....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Done","review":"Having read \\"Dreadnought\\". buying this sequel was automatic on account of how well the first volume was written. \\"Castles of Steel\\" is a worthy sequel, that has an extensive bibliography, and is extremely well written. This book gives an excellent overview of the entire theater of operation, though I felt that this volume provided a bit more British than German perspectives, whereas \\"Dreadnought\\" appeared more balanced in approach. Nevertheless, the subject matter is extensive and fascinating and certainly complete in coverage. You will want to purchase books that focus on particular battles if you are looking for high detail but there is no doubt that this is just about the best narrative summary out there. This book is brimming with fascinating personalities and describes flawlessly their interactions and how these warring spirits stamped the early 20th century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong Narrative","review":"This is one of the better books on the naval engagements during WWI. Massie's strong narrative carries you right along. I learned Churchill was a blundering fool, I came to have more appreciation for Jellicoe and what he was up against both politically and militarily, and I learned Beatty was a p*ssy-whipped prima donna.The naval battles are lovingly recreated. Massie fills the novel with anecdotes which make these historical figures seem more real than they already are. Well-written and a careful attention to detail make this one a must have for anyone who is interested in this conflict. It could have used more maps detailing the intricate movements of the fleets, but that is its only flaw."},{"rating":"1","title":"More propagada.","review":"Here we go again.Like his first book in the series,\\"Dreadnought\\",this book is little more than a bunch of recycled anti-German British propaganda circa 1917.We are even treated to yet another retelling of how the u-boats caused the US to enter the war.What a joke.If you really want to know how and why the US entered the war,read Walter Karp's \\"The Politics Of War\\" instead of this worthless junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"As absorbent as a kitchen towel","review":"The part of this glove that covers the hand is made out of a terry cloth type material.

It is so unfair to the readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money on this subpar effort","review":"I used to buy Susan Johnson's books the moment they were published but not anymore. I wish I'd read some of the reviews before I shelled out my money.Here's my advice: Don't bother with this book if you're looking for an interesting hero, worthy of a strong heroine's love - the hero is an 18 year old Scottish Donald Trump (the Donald's money AND attitude toward women!). Don't bother with this book if you like to read stories where the main characters actually spend time together - they spend as much time apart as together with just a few love scenes. And please don't bother with this book if you enjoyed Ms. Johnson's sexy love scenes from Sinful, Wicked, or Blaze - you won't find enough here to make it worth reading. I suggest you re-read Sinful for the best of Ms. Johnson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointingly thin plot/ Susan Johnson usually does better","review":"Susan Johnson does very lusty novels and that is part of her appeal. However, this book along with her previous book was thin on plot. The female heroine wasn't very appealing with all of her doubts about the hero. The best part was the footnotes."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Please a Lady","review":"I have always loved Susan Johnson's books too, but this one is a real bummer. I guess it's a sequel to something I've read, but after reading 69 pages that seemed to start in the middle of a story, I'm not even interested in finding the earlier book. Who cares about an older woman with five children panting after an 18-year old kid. Come on, Susan, get back to Blaze-type writing, please."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was not one of her best, I was very disappointed!!","review":"Susan Johnston is known for juicy and erotic love scences and all of that was missing in this book,after this I don't think I will be buying anymore of her books.First the hero is an eighteen year old who has basically lived a full life,he is in my opinion infactuated with a twice widowed mother of 5 and soon to be twins with the hero.the lovemaking in the book is very tame compare to her other novels,she has another one due out next year if I do get it I would rather saved myself the money by getting the book from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"This lady was NOT pleased","review":"This one is for all your prudes who complain about excessive sex in Susan Johnson novels. This one, I will personally vouchsafe, is impeccably clean. I did not quite get what the danger in the book was all about , because Roxanne had to be shut up in some house in the beginning for a very long time. Robbie is more of a whining teenage boy, if that's the type of lover you prefer. Also, Roxanne has kids, which kind of diminished the exciting factor of romance novels. The lead antagonist is Argyll who lusts for Roxanne, but he gets vanished after a few chapters, though it would have been nice if he reappeared to show some consistency. Too clean and too boring"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best but certainly the least!","review":"This is the worst of SJ book I have ever read. First of all Robbie Carr is too young, at 18 and spoil, selfish and acts like a child all the time, doesn't constitue what a man should be like. Sorry readers but I enjoy romance and love hot steamy sex but this book lacks everything. The only reason I finish this book was because I spend money on it and also I wanted to know more about Elizabeth and Johnnie(Outlaw). If I had to suggest a book it would be Outlaw and that readers you will get your money worth"},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably the weakest of Susan Johnson's novels","review":"After reading Susan Johnson's novel, A Touch of Sin, I rushed to find and read her other books. I've read her entire library and enjoyed every title. I was really looking forward to her new novel, To Please A Lady. I'm sorry to say that I was very disappointed in this book! It seems that Ms. Johnson has not put the effort into this novel that she has put into the others - as I was reading I wondered if the book was written to fufill a contract. Ms. Johnson's other novels were full of historical detail, great characters, and incredibly erotic love scenes. This books seems to be missing all of those! I never really liked the hero, and the heroine was the sterotypical romantic leading lady and not the strong woman that Ms. Johnson usually writes. The best part of the book was the prequel to Ms. Johnson's next, unnamed novel. Come back Susan, we miss you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as usual","review":"The two main characters in this book already knew each other when it wtarted. There were references made to their past together and how he had seduced her before (it was in her previous books). So, basically, they were already in love when the book started. We don't even get to enjoy their falling in love. I normally love her books, but this one fell short of what I have come to expect from Ms. Johnson."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK!!!","review":"I honestly dont know where to start with this book. I guess for starters, I dont see the huge age gap between Roxie and Robbie sexy in the least. The whole book, I was trying to imagine Robbie as being older and Roxie as being younger. But the biggest thing for me was the yo-yo romance. Up one minute down the next. Very tiring! The only reason I finished was because I cant stand not finishing a book I start. I DO NOT reccomend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"Clearly Susan Johnson has lost some of her earlier creativity. This book doesn't measure up to her others at all. I was amazed to see so many negative reviews, but since I love her writing, decided to disregard the reviews and buy it anyway. Big Mistake! I didn't even finish it. Next time, I'll read these reviews first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty and functional","review":"This is a pretty and functional tart burner. It heats up pretty quickly, and I love that it doesn't have a gaping hole in the back like other burners do. It makes putting a tea light in a little trickier, but it's pretty easy. And the vents make pretty patterns on the ceiling or wall, which is a bonus."},{"rating":"1","title":"an overly-opinionated read","review":"This book is very biased. It was hard to read even as a homosexual with intent to marry. I was looking for more factual information to support my argument for a research paper but read a whole lot more overly-opinionated monologue than fact.

Not only does it feature his greatest illusions, it also has a ton of extras. It has audio commentary by the man himself, television trailers, facts on Copperfield, a tour of his museum, and much more. It all adds up to over 2 hours of bonus features.

The Collosal Grey Sunshine is my favorite track, and one of my favorite songs of all time.David Kosten is a rising star, one to look for, but not look at."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad","review":"All the songs seem really slow and tired and melancholy. With appearances by the likes of Chris Martin, it should sound that way, but this just goes too far and the songs seem too repetitive (I really do like Chris in Coldplay).There is one track with exception to the typical sound - the song where cannibal ox throws down a rap rhyme just to keep the kids in touch with their funky side. Yo. I didn't like that sound either.I think the photos in the CD booklet are indicitive of the music on the CD.

The commentary is muted to the left channel and loud sound effects and music drowns out the commentary. Not all the time, but enough that you have to keep adjusting the volume. It's too bad, the stories told by the pilots are riveting, but you have to at times strain to hear them or quickly adjust the volume after the sound effects our music dies down. I would recommend another set over this.

Lisa Nichols has gathered stories that will warm your heart and inspire you to evaluate your position on certain issues. This is not the typical collection of stories which blame men or other races.

I'm a big fan of Devin Alexander's recipes so I picked up this book and I'm totally loving it. Mostly healthy and fast (and yummy) recipes in this cookbook.I have a couple of quibbles that forced me to give the book 4 stars instead of 5. As another reviewer said, a grocery list would have been nice. But my biggest issue is that the recipes are not broken down into the Biggest Loser 4-3-2-1 pyramid that is mentioned in the front part of the book. I have to break the recipes down myself, which is a real pain!Also, a little too much info about the Biggest Loser contestants in the cookbook....I've never even seen the US version of the show, so it was neither helpful nor inspiring to me to read that a specific recipe was a contestant's favorite.

However, I would not recommend any from this book as they are very high in sodium. I was surprised to see this as I thought they would be healthier. I suggest that you buy a lot of vegetables and broil your meats if you are interested in losing weight. Keep it simple. Make salads and measure all of the ingredients you use, especially salad dressing (lots of calories and sodium in most of those). Even better, make your own dressing or just use olive oil and vinegar. I recommend the Harvard School of Public Health Healthy Eating Pyramid:[...]It's easier to understand and more accurate than the USDA food pyramid, which makes no sense at all since they changed it.I ended up checking out this book from the library and I suggest you should too, if you can stomach the salt.

She forgot the dream, but not the question.\\" And then he begins, page by page to set up a series of dots. Somebody else of the reviewers can tell you about the MBTI part of this book. All of that is hidden. Lopker reveals me. And he reveals my lover. And he reveals my dad that I took to Alaska to rough it in the woods.

As a reference volume or identification guide, this falls short, but as a general overview of the world of melmac, probably this is the sort of information that most semi-casual collectors can use. Until a better volume on this subject comes along (rumor has it that a promising young scholar is working on just such an opus) this still has to rank as about the best set of encapsulated summaries and illustrations available. Hence 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"SO DISSAPOINTING!","review":"I have to agree with other reviewers. For those of us who love collecting melmac, this guide falls short by a mile. There was so much more to say about this fabulous vintage dinnerware - including listing pattern and color names, but it was nowhere to be found. Hopefully, someone else will publish a more comprehensive guide for us Melmacians!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Research 101?","review":"I found this book very disappointing: the authors did a minimum of research. Instead, they filled the pages with photos of items from their own collection--the monotony of this approach is quickly evident.

There is also a magazine you can subscribe to written by her, her daughters, and many readers (no ads!). My one-year old is always so calm when I play a Nancy tape or DVD - Nancy has a really soothing voice.

I didn't finish the book because of my views below.I found that Nancy Campbell twisted scripture to make her point at times. There is no correlation between Paul laboring day and night to preach the gospel and night nursing a child. Many things were more her opinion pushed as if it was gospel. If she had approached the book more as something that has worked for her or her view, I wouldn't have had as much a problem with it.

Indeed it is hard to find the center of this book, as it were. It's style is certainly impressionistic, it is certainly detailed, it is certainly literary, it is certainly written by a writer not interested in being popular, and it must be said that sometimes it is certainly easy to occasionally lose Beer's direction or understand exactly what/who he is writing about. Still, it is wonderfully well-written, and actually fun to read, if you go with the flow -- which is sometimes, it seems, at cross currents.

It's not that the language didn't make sense: yep, subjects, predicates, familiar words in English... But overall, the book was written in some abstract style that I just didn't \\"get\\" at all.

My son and I would look at each other and laugh at just how lame and this was. The highlight to us was in the scene where the 2 main players are parting with the girls, they are jacked by two other guys looking for this \\"package\\" One of them has a gun and knife in each hand. He fumbels and juggles the knife and finally puts it down, since it was about 15 minuets into a continuous shot, he almost blew it.All in all there is no story, no action, just a waste of $5.00THIS MOVIE WOULD BE PERFECT FOR SOMEONE WITH INSOMNIA"},{"rating":"2","title":"I really love this DVD.","review":"This Hoodrats DVD is really good and i hope they make part 3 because it will be really good."},{"rating":"1","title":"hoorats","review":"worst movie ever and money threw it away. friend gave his to the goodwill. my other friend sold his on ebay for 99 cent"},{"rating":"1","title":"hood rats","review":"I knew this movie would be a low budget film and I was not expecting much and that is exactly what I got at the most it was filmed in two locations a street corner for 15 minutes and about 45 thru 1 hour in a living room I give this movie 2 stars because 1 star is just to mean"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid","review":"I was rummaging in the Walmart $5 DVD bin and saw this one and decided to buy it to see what it was about.

There's one scene were the two guys and two girls are talking and all the camera man does is rotate around them!!! No close ups, MDs, no mixing anything up. This combined with lame dialog, and sterotypical Californian Mexican acting. The director and producer have Latino last names and they potrayed our people really bad. And what's up with the title???

McCammon has drawn some wonderful characters and put them in an interesting story. The only thing I didn't like was the introduction of important new characters in the last quarter of the book. The characters (or rather the situations with which they were involved) were hinted at earlier in the book, but I think the hints could have been a little stronger.

I mistakenly was under the impression this included the original novel (which I highly enjoyed) along with the kit extras. That was my own mistake of course. However, once realizing that, the kit seemed fairy empty, with charts, coupons, and scrolls that you can only use once. The cards are reusable, but that's the main item with content. Other objects seem to serve more as a distraction than helping you write.I do think the presentation of the kit and design is rather nice.

To me, it's a bit like a motivational introduction to a multi-level marketing business...the business being your novel. And hey, if that fires you up, great! I expected a book of some substance with some real direction. If this were a kit on sky-diving, I suspect it would be called \\"No Chute, No Problem\\" and the kit's instructions would boil down to a flyer that reads \\"JUMP!\\" (granted...getting started on anything is 90% the battle...but a plan will be needed at some point...and that time is preferably before you leave the plane!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Mom Loves It!","review":"My mom still believes in \\"plot\\" and so on (i don't, i'm a stephen king follower), and she has been working on her first novel.

This is nothing more than a gimmick; the book by the same title might have been slightly better. But at this point I wouldn't bet any money on it being so.

It would serve the public well if the movie had more exposure. Tragically, O'Grady represents thousands of predators who are held in esteem in the church. It was refreshing to ultimately see a finger pointed at the persons at the top, i.e. the popes, cardinals and bishops, under whose \\"watch\\" this happened and continues to happen!

The main focus is on the fundamentals such as synthes and fabrication and covers as large range of toptics: nanoparticles, nanowires, nanorods, thin films, and carbon nanotubes as well as a diverse range of patterning techniques (AFM, self-assembly through conventional lithographic techniques). The last chapter of about 20 pages on applications is a bit short and only gives a general feel. The book should be suitable to both advanced undergrads or grad. students in chemistry, material science, physics, and EE. I myself found it quite accessible for self-study. I especially, liked the first ~50 pags explaining the fundamental such as surface chemistry and excellent explanation of surface tension."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great textbook!","review":"Many books in this area are too concerned with the nano hype and less focused on the science behind it. Others present several chapters, each written by a specific set of authors, that are not necessarily correlated and seem more like a collection of review papers instead of a book. In this context, in my opinion, this book is one of the best books covering the subject (together with ozin's nano chemistry). It covers the real fundamentals and the science that drives the field together with current relevant advances and applications.

It is very simple for her to set up and work independently. She is able to create a fashion girl to trace by choosing her legs, midsection and head. I was impressed by the ease of the toy and how much she enjoys tracing and coloring the figure with the enclosed color pencils.

It was just a plain day (or night) for the two brothers and suddenly, there friend at the bar is dead. Things get even worse when their compaion kid, also known as a hippie disappeared. The frantic sister who also started dating Bryon looked everywhere for him.the ending was scary. Bryon and Mark's connection was lost and that made things worse. Mark hated Bryon now and the relationship was broken. It surprised me that such a close relationship with two guys could go down so fast and they end up hating each other. This book is good to read if you do not mind the cuss words and all the violence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do educators make their students read THIS?","review":"This book is more of a middle aged teacher's way of having their students/kids realize what they supposedly went through decades ago. Character's were way too vulgar, and the monolouge was full of slang so outdated that it was difficult to grasp what they were speaking of or describing.Teachers may enjoy this reminiscent into their past, but I as a kid growing up in this different society didn't quite understand why those were called the \\"good old days\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is interesting but is inverted at the end.","review":"This book is very interesting , it kept me turning the pages.

They question their friendship all through the book. I really like this book becouse it keepps you on the edge oof your seat. You feel all these emotions about the the characters. The main chatacters are Mark and Byron. There are only a few thins wrong with this book. S.E.Hinton can not come up with new names such as the place they hang out at. They hang out at the Dingo. In The Outsiders that is were they hang out. One of the characters in this book is Tim and Curly Shepard.Tim Shepard is a character in The Outsiders. All and all this was a good book. I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the BEST BOOKS I've read-EVER.","review":"This book really ranked up there with my favorites. When I looked at the cover I never thought I'd enjoy it so much, but as the saying says you can't judge a book by its cover. As a teenager, this book really touched me. After loosing his parents, Mark lives with his best friend Bryon. After an unfortunate chain of events, Bryon is forced to make a desicion that could destroy his friendship with Mark. That Was Then This Is Now is a good book for teenagers and adults. It helps teens cope with the problems of today and it could even help parents be more open minded to their kids.It also talks about drug awareness. READ THIS BOOK! IT'S NOT A WASTE OF TIME!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is real good.","review":"What I liked about the book is that it was very well expressed like when Bryon found out that Mark was selling these drug pills. He was really shocked and mad when he found out. He felt like he lost his best friend, his only brother. But what I didn't like about the book was that they put you in a real tough position. You seem like you got to choose between your best friend or your girlfriend, but at the end it will turn out bad anyways. I thought that this book was really good. This book(to me) seemed to be better than the Outsiders. They seem to have dramatic and action scenes up in it. They had a lot of choices they make. They also get into a lot of fights, not a lot but enough. The Outsiders seem to have a lot of action scenes only, but they do have some dramatic scenes. Yes, I would recommend this book to somebody else because I think other people might enjoy it as much as i did. This book will probably encourage other people to read more or read more S.E. Hinton books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hinton's best work,besides the Outsiders","review":"I am only ten years old and I have already read all of S.E.

I am in the process of reading it now with my class, and it amazes me how effective this novel still is (thirty years after it was written!!!) I teach in a VERY inner-city school environment. Many of my students are from Indian Reservations from outside the city, and their interest in this book is peaked. I am able to branch off into so many other areas of interest from this book, and it delights me to see so many of my students take it home at nights upon their own initiative.This book is a MUST READ for all middle years teachers and students.

Wow! Powerful!SE Hinton does an admirable job building the character structure for Bryon and Mark. It was a little tedious at first but paid off later. The message antidrug message is strong, the struggle for individuality is apparent and although the ending is indeed depressing, it is necessary.I highly recommend this book for Middle School readers but would advise a parental consent in advance."},{"rating":"1","title":"That Was Then This is Now","review":"This book S.E.Hinton wrote called That Was Then This Is Now is not a very good book to read. One reason is because the characters switch around too much. The second reason is because the characters talk like the person who is reading the book is about seven or eight years of age. The third reason is because the description of the characters is poor. If I was to do a book report I wouldn't personally choose this book because of the poor description.ATTENTION!!!

It was unbelievable that Bryon would do such a thing to theclosest person in his life. I find this twist to be unrealistic especially since Bryon knew Mark would quit selling if he asked him to.

Ever since I read The Outsiders I knew I would LLOOVVEE all of S.E. Hintons books (and and so far after reading thoes two and Taming the Star Runner I do).

After reading this book, I just really felt like I had to think about it, and I like books that do that."},{"rating":"2","title":"deep...","review":"when i first picked up this book i expected it to be another book like The Outsiders, but it isn't. it is about life and growing up in general, but for once it isn't suger-coated; like all those 'young adult' books. it doesn't have a happy ending, it doesn't really resolve, but it does let you know that life goes on, and that it allways will. so if you want a 'happily ever after' story don't get this, but if you want a real book about life then you will like this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!!!","review":"I recomend this book to any one because it has a great story line about the evrage everyday teenagers who live in the city.I also found this to be a easy read. it is only 157 pages long so it is not that bad length wise.the bottom line- easy book to read, has a great exiting story line, great book for teenagers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"\\"~The book that I read was That Was Then, This Is Now.

Unfortunately it quickly slides into repetitious descriptions of barren landscapes, burnt out villages and murdered villagers, and gory confrontations with indians.The writing isn't bad, if not a bit campy, but it just never changes. No characters develop, save The Judge - by far the best part of this book - the plot doesn't stray far from a bleak sense of nihilism. Just not an interesting book in the end.

You alternately despise the characters, but revel in the astonishing craftsmanship of their creation.

The middle 90% was pretty dense, but like the border trilogy, the last few chapters were ample reward for slogging through.

This particular book is page after page of purely blathering, mindless violence; there is no reason for the killings; there is absolutely no character development to give you any insight into the reasons behind the actions. It is pure bunk to me to give the author any credit for \\"literary prose\\" - this is pure and utter trash.His premise re the basic evil nature of man (I guess seen in most of his books) may be an acceptable premise, but how about some insights into the root causes, rather than an unending tabloid description of killing.Unfortunately, this will be my last McCarthy book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Writing but What's the Point","review":"What's the point.

There may be a story underneath the 75% of the book that's useless, boring and showy description of nothing anybody cares about, but it's not worth the effort to uncover.

Pretending you like it does not make you a genius literary critic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Engaging language; violence is too much","review":"After reading the trillogy, Blood Meridian was disappointing. This book should not be recommended to all - there is no point to that much violence in one novel.

However, after so much violence, it becomes pointless - violence merely for violence's sake."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLOOD MERIDIAN","review":"A trite and pointless piece of work.

Every time I read it, I notice something I didn't notice before. The closest way I can describe how it \\"feels\\" is that it's something like what you would see if you went hiking in the desert, dropped acid and then were bitten by a rattlesnake and left to wander in a state of dreaming hallucination and delirium. The surreal world where the story is spun is impossibly detailed and vivid and imbued with a quality that I'd swear Cormac McCarthy couldn't dream up without having been there.Buy a copy and never look back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blood Meridian -- Exquisite and Horrific","review":"Cormac McCarthy's Blood Meridian is both exquisite and horrific. Though not for the weak-minded or faint-hearted, this book is pure poetry. McCarthy's writing style is unmatched, flowing seamlessly from Faulknerian sparsity to intricately detailed descriptions reminiscent of Hemingway. Set in a literal blood meridian, the plot focuses on a young man's journey through a metaphorical blood meridian from childhood to adulthood. The real story, however, is the development of the ambiguous Judge. Is he God? Is he Satan? Is he simply Other? It doesn't matter -- at over 300 pages, Blood Meridian seems over too quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cormac McCarthy as Joseph Conrad","review":"A dusty, hard-riding, cowboy version of The Heart of Darkness. Complete with a Kurtz!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark. Depressing. Unrelenting.","review":"Truly a LONG & SLOW read; twisted descriptions; mean evil characters. No good to be found here. This is the last time Mr. McCormac wastes my reading time. No real plot, just a meandering scenario of meanness, torture and filth. All the men were ruthless, merciless, unkind; the women were all one-dimenstional working girls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Purely gibberish","review":"It is absolutely beyond me that this book gets the number of favorable reviews that it does.I don't understand it. I found it to be boring, tedius, and largely incomprehensible. I actually read the entire book, although I was reaady to quit early into it, in the hope that eventually it would get somewhere. It never does. Page after page of gibberish that makes no sense at all, interspersed with scenes of pointless violence. A bunch of guys ride around Mexico killing everyone they come across for no particular reason. I guess if you're an english major or a law school professor or someone of that ilk who is obviously smarter than I am, you can understand and/or appreciate this book.I cannot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I thought this was the worst story I ever read. I coudn't even finish it. A great disappointment from a great writer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blood Meridian","review":"The author seems to be in love with his ability to write prose. He uses a $20 dollar words where a few $5 dollar words would do. I have been picking it up and laying back down for almost a month. Hard to read. His word pictures aredistorted. Almost surreal. His voice is the voice of a man wanting to be the smartest guy in the room."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEPRESSING JUMPED-UP SHORT STORY NOT WORTH YOUR TIME","review":"BLOOD MERIDIAN is a novella or long short story streched out to make a 335-page novel. There is basically little if any plot. While Cormac McCarthy can write poetically, writing poetically about nothing is still nothing. It's like a million times zero is still zero. Most of the book is just one murder, slaughter, killing, massacre, beating, stabbing, shooting, scalping after another. It is an unrelentingly dark and depressing view of a time and place in history (Mexico and the southwest in the 19th century) without any redeeming happiness or hope. You cannot read this book from end to end without becoming depressed yourself. While I admire Mr. McCarthy's writing (see my wildly favorable review of NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), BLOOD MERIDIAN is not worth your time or the fourteen dollars the book costs. Don't contaminate your mind with this jumped-up short story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless - Endless - Waste.","review":"My first and last McCarthy book. Horribly boring, pointless. Perhaps some academic can imagine some underlying genius but to me it's an endless string of \\"This horrible thing happened and then that. Another atrocity and then another one\\" Lyrical - bull. Zero redeeming qualities. Waste of my money and life."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the 'bloody' point?","review":"The prose is excellent, the characters very convincing, and the descriptive narrative is truly atmospheric. You really feel as though you have entered a living, breathing world in this novel. So why the hideous, quite pointles violence for scene after scene after scene? Is it just some immature impulse on the author's part to see how disgusting he can be? Is it an attempt to out-do the Bret Easton Ellises of this world? It's a shame that such an obviously talented author stoops to such repulsive imagery - the novel would have worked perfectly well without it. The concept of decency seems to have disappeared from modern American writing - apparently not even the finest luminaries are immune. I can hardly bear to say it, but if you think a work which features graphic descriptions of infants' heads being smashed open across rocks is still literature, then read it. Otherwise, there's really something lacking in someone who can publish this stuff without embarrassment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great take on a land less traveled","review":"This was a great romp through the old west in a way you wouldn't think. The old west wasn't Bonanza according to 'Blood Meridian'. McCarthy's writing style can be tiresome at times (just who does he think he is anyway, Faulkner?) but the characters are well developed and the setting is fantastic - and I HATE western stories and movies. This is a must read, even if the rumor is true that McCarthy didn't do an iota of research into seeing if his vision of the old west was really true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blood Meridian","review":"I would recommend Blood Meridian only for the recycle bin. This book is very poorly written with no consistent story line."},{"rating":"2","title":"21st Century Classic?","review":"I saw this book on a list of must read 21st century classics. I consider myself to be a pretty well read person and I had never heard of this novel. So my curiosity got the better of me and I read it.This book reminds me a lot of the Clint Eastwood movie \\"Unforgiven\\". The story is told in a very straightforward style with very little insight into the characters emotions, feelings, or motivations. Numerous other reviews describe this book as one of the most violent in American literature. I didn't think it was very violent at all. The violence is described very matter-of-factly. I wouldn't call it \\"gory\\" at all.McCarthy is a writer with a style from a bygone age and I really enjoyed his scenery discriptions. Overall, I enjoyed this read, but I'm not sure it belongs on a list of the top 21st century novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Describes the eternal darkness of the human heart","review":"The opening line goes with other great ones, e.g. Moby Dick. I read this first and then went back and read his earlier stuff and then came back to the trilogy. In my opinion he goes through some kind of hell in the Southeast to move to El Paso where he sees life in the most interesting way, that somehow dries up and vindicates his gothic soul to write this book that reminds us of primevil existence. Somehow in this hell he develops the trilogy. I've only read All the Pretty Horses and part of The Crossing, but it seems it all got started w/ BM which was some kind of incredible acknowledgement and embracing of the dark side of human nature. Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"I could not finish it. Too much horrible imagery","review":"I started reading Blood Meridian a few days ago. I got about 80 pages into it and stopped. I took it back to the library earlier this evening and feel relieved and happy that I did not continue reading it.There is too much horrible imagery in Blood Meridian. I don't want those images in my mind. It was very well written and the story carried me along and I was conflicted about stopping but I am glad I stopped. Too many graphic images of torture, murder, mutilation, dead babies, excrement, flies, bloody body parts, agony and so on. I don't want those images, written by a genius in creating powerfuldescriptive visual images. I don't want those images in my mind.I don't recommend the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult read","review":"This was the recommendation of another author who writes serial killer novels. I expected this to be along those lines. The author's writing was difficult to interpret and at times I had to readt the paragraph a few times to get the gist of the meaning behind it. The store is about a gang of marauders who go down to Mexico killing Indians as well as Americans and goes into detail on all the gory details of the murders including scalping. I wouldn't recommend this book. It may be an author's author but not the comman man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to read","review":"I had to read this book for my book club. It was violent and disconnected. I never finished it. He was a very descriptive writer but I had nightmares about some scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious & boring!","review":"The author of this book uses absurd flowery & verbose language to describe a series of violent, homicidal incidents perpetrated by a very forgetable group of murderous ruffians. It's an example of men without morals bludgeoning & beating their way through life & is presented in a totally confusing manner. Who they were, where they came from & what made them tick? Beats me, & frankly, I didn't give a damn! If you do want to read about man's terrible inhumanity to man, written by someone who really understands the English language, try All Souls Rising, by Maddison Bell, not this pretentious clap-trap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"fiction","review":"Amazingly beautiful, and beautiful and intense writing. Brutal and gripping, but I was hugely disappointed with the supernatural hocus pocus aspects of the judge and the frayed disjointed ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great book by Cormac McCarthy","review":"I have read reviews of Blood Meridian that say this could be the great American novel. I tend to agree. It is compelling to say the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"bloody but written with beauty","review":"The book is about violence and survival and therefore inevitably brutal and grotesque. The magic in this book is the beauty of the words describing the whold mixture of violence with the silent, often tranquil and serene surrounding nature. This is not the type of book one \\"enjoys\\" but the author's skills are extraordinary and very rare to find in modern American literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"This is one of the best novels written. I couldn't put it down when I was reading it, and I couldn't stop thinking about it for months afterwards. I cannot remember characters depicted as vividly as his by any other author, and I think that is the real beauty of this book.This novel is worth reading, and then it is worth reading again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A dark and provocative book.","review":"A dark tale that includes one of the most evil villains imagineable, Blood Meridian takes the reader on a journey with a motley gang of indian hunters through the American southwest of 1848. McCarthy uses graphic descriptions that really put the reader in touch with the violence of the book, and the violence is not nearly as disturbing as the ending. However, he tells the story in a way that captures the essence of the situation in such a way as to make the violence necessary and immediate so as to prevent it from becoming gratuitous.Upon completing this book, I found myself deeply concerned and completely moved, and I realized that I loved this book even though it was not really a joy to read. It is most definitely not the page turner that some of McCarthy's later books are. Yet, it is probably his best book because of how it affects the reader. Blood Meridian is a beautiful and violent epic tale, and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my favorites","review":"The only reason I am writing this review is that I was appalled by how obnoxious Derek Lang's review is. I looked at his other reviews and it appears to me as though he has managed to master 5 or 6 fancy words which he uses with revolting frequency, i.e. \\"coeval, belletristic, adumbrate\\". He actually refers to himself as a non-elitist intellectual -- all while bashing modern authors, including Mr. McCarthy. He actually calls Cormack pretentious!!Derek - we are not impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ominous, Deliberate, and Ambiguous","review":"This was my first Cormac McCarthy read. It was a great novel. There is no way to tell for sure what type of world McCarthy was trying to create, or how accurate the portrayal was of the times. However, this book was as ominous as a blade on the brow, as deliberate as a trail-ride across the expansive wilderness, and as morally ambiguous as a government sanctioned band of murderers. The book is a very interesting take on a complex element of American history. Not my favorite McCarthy novel (see \\"The Road\\"), but definitely a great one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Introduction spoiler","review":"This is certainly a very disturbing book. I enjoyed it as I do most of his books. I am only writing this review to warn all those who buy the book not to read the Introduction until after reading the book. I was absolutely furious that Harold Bloom would give away the ending of the story in his Intro. I can't tell you how much it ruined the story. One last thing:DON'T READ THE INTRODUCTION!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eloquent discriptions, Savage vision, Fantastic.","review":"The prose in Blood Meridian is so eloquent that it is often decieving. It is very easy to get caught up in the flow and forget what is actually being described. This is, without a doubt, the most violent story I have ever read, yet it is extreemly tender in its presentation. One has to carefully picture some of the scenes to see the full impact of McCarthy's vivid and incredibly authentic vision. He is able to describe truely horrific scenes with such care that one must look very closely to see the savagery he is depicting. It is incredibly authentic, which is what makes the horror palatable. It is not gratuitous, in fact, the savagery is veiled by the eloquence of the prose. It is on of my favorite books. I highly recomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is McCarthy at his best.","review":"I think when McCarthy started on \\"The Border Trilogy\\" he might have been seeking a wider audience since the books were more of an \\"easy\\" read. \\"Blood Meridian\\" was not simply about violence-- It goes much deeper than that I think. It's about something that \\"will never die.\\"Perhaps one has to be a bit of an existentialist to really appreciate this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Answer to question from London reader","review":"The \\"I\\" in paragraph 2 of chapter one is the kid's father, drunk and reminiscing, speaking directly to the kid. McCarthy's eschewal of quotation marks does make this a little ambiguous, but not hopelessly so. The Leonids meteor shower of 1833 was one of the most spectacular in recorded history -- possibly 150,000 meteors per hour -- and it occurred on the night of November 12/13, pinpointing the kid's birthday. Notice also that at the end of the novel, when the now middle-aged kid walks out to the jakes in Fort Griffin to meet his grisly fate at the hands of the Judge, there is another spectacular meteor storm occurring -- possibly the Leonids again, which would mean the kid dies on his birthday."},{"rating":"2","title":"100 Words or Less","review":"McCarthy knows now to take the edges of society and reduce them to mere animals. This book is brutal. The main character lurches along from one debasement to the next, and some scenes are so difficult to read, I felt a tiny bit nauseous. Yet, it's McCarthy. What else do you expect? And in the end, this book is beautiful in a sort of wildlife safari way. Yes, there's death and blood and heartlessness. But that is how the characters see themselves and the world around them. Like it or not, it has a way of drawing you in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely amazing","review":"Absolutely amazing book - Bone-chilling, violent, breath-taking, lyrical... As a horror aficionado, I went into this book thinking it would be a quieter story, more of a western and written in the vein of \\"All the Pretty Horses.\\" Nothing could be further from what this book is - The storyline is shocking and filled with terrifying scenes. I am continuously amazed at the author's clear prose and descriptive prowess - McCarthy is truly a master author."},{"rating":"2","title":"if you like cormack","review":"Cormack McCarthy is my favorite author and I loved this book.

But the unrelenting amount of violence and cruelty in Blood Meridian strikes me as having crossed the line to pornography. Are we supposed to enjoy it? Are we supposed to be horrified, enlightened? To what purpose? Other than perhaps to recognize that CM can turn a phrase, I do not see any purpose or value. Do any of the characters presented have a discernible personality or motivation for their actions?

I had to repeat many sentences to determine if a character was talking or if I was reading narrative gab. Come to think of it, after all that, the story wasn't even that interesting.

It started off great with the introduction for the Judge, but went down hill. I have never, stopped reading a book, no matter how bad it is, but after making it through 80% of this book I had, had enough. His endless descriptions of the landscape where great in the beginning, but got very tedious and consumed large portions of the book. The main reason I stopped was his use of metaphors. In a single paragraph describing the desert there might be 4 to 7 analogies. Once I realized this I couldn't not see them and really started to annoy me. At some points he actually had analogies describing other analogies.He appears to have cut back on the analogies in his later books.

I was very let down. The violence does not stop at all and halfway through you become immune to it. The rest of the bloodshed is rendered moot by the repetition. The characters that are supposed to be followed either in fascination or dread are barely sketched in at all. You can easily forget that \\"the kid\\" is even in the tale at all.

I would read an entire chapter and didn't really understand what happened. McCarthy is just often too wordy for me as well. I think he just tries too hard. The story had potential but the way he told it, well, nothing happened. Graphic violence and lot of people killed - that about sums it up. The antagonist and protagonist were hard to identify with.

Certainly, McCarthy has tremendous gifts as a writer.But the relentlessness of the violence does not make it more powerful -- it makes it monotonous. It's like listening to a Eddie Van Halen guitar solo for 7 hours. At times, McCarthy just seems to be trying to outdo whatever grotesque murder / dismemberment scene he came up with 10 pages before.

A pessimistic view of human nature, or the \\"human condition\\", but not necessarily an inaccurate one. Who knows what dwells in the soul of man? The first sentence, \\"See the child.\\" should rank with the first in Moby Dick as one of the best remembered in literature. Is what we see in the child in the pages that follow a valid reflection of human nature? Could a band of such revolting criminals have ever roamed the face of the earth?

I have to believe that he must be embarrassed to have this book back on the market. I hated this book and could not bring myself to finish it. It was tedious, pointless, and in the end just boring. This book was written long before McCarthy had mastered the style that has brought him so much fame and credit. In this book, one sees him trying hard to hone his now-extraordinary powers of observation and description, and failing badly. That the publisher decided to release this book again long after it had been retired from view is a violation of public trust. Deserves no gold star as it has no redeeming qualities."},{"rating":"1","title":"too violent","review":"all about violence and no plot what so ever. guess people think he is cool because he writes so violent.

You can understand why the characters continually refer to \\"imbeciles\\", \\"niggers\\" and \\"savages\\" but throughout the expository passages, McCarthy uses the same exact terms. Perhaps if he had used a word like \\"kike\\", people like Harold Bloom might have taken a different attitude. This simply reflects how deep prejudices lie in American society, including the intelligentsia. I should add that I would have given this book no stars, but amazon insists on using at least one."},{"rating":"1","title":"With apologies to Mr. McCarthy","review":"I gave this one star because I am not sorry I read it. Now I can discuss it intelligently with people who insist that it is some kind of masterpiece, and know that what I am talking about: this book is simply just not \\"all that\\".Yes, the text itself is lyrical, and elegiac, and enigmatic. It is, in fact, more than a little too enigmatic. If you don't mind wading through reams of repetitive descriptive passages and being hit over the head with Tone (with a capital 'T') and Mood (with a capital 'M'), then by all means, you read this book, too, and see if you can make sense of (a) the violence, (b) the ending, and/or (c) the point.Alternatively, for a much more ultimately entertaining treatment of violence (with a capital 'V'), rent the movie \\"Clockwork Orange\\" and just imagine they are wearing cowboy hats. Yee-hah!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too self-aware of a writer","review":"Was there a quota on similes? He seems to write one in almost every paragraph; it gets to be quite distracting and almost comical. \\"Like......like......like....\\" He starts to sound like a valley-girl. I guess I prefer the less \\"flowery\\" and more straight-forward westerns like the LONESOME DOVE books. This just got more and more annoying as I read. It is only the second book I have read by this author, the first being THE ROAD. That one was simpler and more intriguing, but still not the best thing I have read. I can understand why the academic elites celebrate this author; he writes with that \\"I am a great writer\\" self consciousness that those people love. I find it boring and condescending. This will probably be the last book I read by McCarthy. He is simply not my cup of tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Frightening Need to Agree","review":"I've read this book twice, and I am more convinced than ever that Cormac McCarthy is just a guy with a facility for expression that is unevenly expressed in his several books. This book is a boring book.Esoteric words, eccentric expressions, pedantic philosophizing, arcane symbolism - in the service of what? OK, so he can use words creatively and create imagery. Connotative words are misspent when the reader has no familiarity with their meaning.The real horror here is that so many people want to be perceived as intelligent and aesthetically sensitive that they are afraid to point out the flaws in this rambling rubble.Man is an animal capable of horrific and bestial behavior; if the Holocaust does not convey that message clearly to you, and you find the message in this self-serving mess then I feel sorry for all of us."},{"rating":"1","title":"so bad","review":"Unless you're a professor emeritus of post-modern American literature, this book is long, boring, nihilistic, and very unenjoyable. I zoned out a few minutes at a time and didn't miss anything. The bulk of the book is a group of men wandering the desert and murdering and scalping people. The violence is over the top. None of the characters are relatable. The language of the writer is difficult to follow and his descriptions too flowery. I can't dislike a book more than I dislike this one.

Being a medical physician myself, I obviously identified with Dr. Offri's personal stories and accounts of her experience as a medical student, intern and resident. But more than just stories, Danielle is such an excellent writer she provokes to a lesser degree some of the same emotions in the reader that she is recalling having experienced. After reading this book I find myself looking at my own patients with a much broader perspective, seeing them as people, parents, children and spouses not just pathologies. (Difficult for a busy cardiologist). Like the House of God, a must read for all physicians and physicians in training but for different reasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as it could be","review":"I read this book thinking that stories written by a doctor would be fascinating. I honestly got tired of hearing the author talk about crying every 10 minutes and all of her self esteem issues. I wanted to hear more stories and less personal musings. The stories were interesting in their own right, but went on WAY too long. I would have rather had a more brief description of events and more of them. (more about the patients much less whining and agonizing by the author)."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderfully written and compelling","review":"With wry humor, grace, honesty, and intelligence, Danielle Ofri takes us into the bewildering world of medical training from a doctor's point of view. Though many of her experiences will be familiar to anyone in medicine, what sets this book apart is the deftness and fidelity with which those experiences are rendered. For the medical and non-medical reader alike, I couldn't recommend it more highly.--An ER doctor in Albuquerque, New Mexico"},{"rating":"2","title":"If wasn't already scared...","review":"I am a second year medical student and after reading this book I'm not sure if I am encouraged or more frightened about what I am about to face in the next 5 years. I am encouraged that some one else with little confidence can survive, but I am afraid of the many daunting tasks and cases that I could meet. Ofri does a good job at expressing the efforts and troubles that an aspiring physician must face. However I think that few of us will find such entertaining stories. However embellished the stories are they make for good reading for everyone, non-medical folks will appreciate the fine story telling and people in the field will appreciate the stories and technical aspects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartwarming","review":"I couldn't put the book down. Danielle is a wonderful, gifted writer who made me feel as if I was right there with her on rounds. She wrote about people and the doctor patient relationship , not about medical jargon,procedures and tests. It was conforting to see how much a doctor cares about her patients."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Original Thinker","review":"I'm a long-time admirer of Danielle Ofri's writing. Her generosity of spirit, both as a writer and a physician, shines through on every page. A meticulous prose stylist, she's also insightful, deeply caring, and a truly original thinker and do-er. When you read this book, you'll be giving a true gift to yourself.-- Janice Eidus, author, The War of the Rosens"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"I knew that Danielle Ofri was an outstanding editor (if you haven't read the Bellevue Literary Review, edited by Ofri, run out a get a copy--it's one of the best journals being published today), now I learn that she's an outstanding author as well. Reading Singular Intimacies I found myself weeping, cheering, and just plain enjoying. She captures perfectly the transition from medical student to physician, the internal and external changes, the growing sense of expertise, and the arrival of true caring. Along the way she reveals herself as fully human and compassionate. Among the many currently popular books by physicians, this one stands out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely!","review":"Singular Intimacies is among the best memoirs I've read. I'm not in a medical field but after joining Dr. Ofri on her rounds through the essays in this book, I feel I understand something of that world intimately. As patients, potential patients and as the loved ones of those needing care, I think it's common to worry that doctors won't see our humanness. In reading this book, I saw theirs. The young doctor we meet in these pages is thoughtful, responsive and caring to the point of vulnerable. When I finished Dr. Ofri's book, I immediately missed her company. She writes with intelligence, candor and heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Singular intimacies","review":"This book does a great job chronicling the challenges both patients and physicians face in a busy public hospital.

Even though it was recorded in the early 80's this collection of songs sounds like it was done yesterday. The song writing here is poetry, and the track \\"Winter\\" paints some wonderful pictures. One of my favorites \\"The Classical\\" which has a raw energy that few bands have captured before or since. Also featured is \\"Hip Priest\\" which has become a trademark for Mark E. Smith, who deserves a bit more credit. You can hear the roots of this album in so many places today - ranging from hip hop to industrial.

The other 18 were about the ever-inticing walk into the \\"dark side\\". The book has very detailed information about the \\"dark side\\", the accuracy of which can only be known by the initiates. In faith discussions it is useful to know something of the other belief systems, but it is equally or perhaps more important to know and understand the position you claim to represent. I would have appreciated more details on how his conversion to Christianity has changed his life.Another negative in my opinion is a bit of Catholic bashing, which is common to other Chick Publications I have seen (such as Death Cookie). Though the author reveals that along his life he has been one of the hypocrites (for example simultaneously moving through the Wicca ranks and the Old Catholic Church) that turn others away from Christ, which means that it isn't the insitution's fault but the sinners within."},{"rating":"2","title":"Play the ball... not the player...","review":"One thing that stands out from these low star reviews is the fact that the authors of these reviews have not read Schnoebelen's books. How can you say that a person who worked in the occult for more than a decade has not done his research? A good review argues the point, whether or not you agree with a book. I do not see that happening here. Antagonists only loose themselves in a frenzy of personal attacks on the author and vague, general criticism. Reviews are subjective ofcourse, but if you have a point to make please be specific so people know what you're talking about. Writing reviews in a vain attempt to be funny and attacking a paradigm you don't agree with instead of specifically commenting on the novel in question is not what this forum is meant for.

Toure himself put the shoe on the other foot by saying that John Lee Hooker is a Malian at heart. One can hear a resonance in these two voices, but the music is very different. Toure comes from a strong Islamic as well as African tradition, and this music very much reflects that.Toure was disappointed by some of the collaborative efforts he did, Taj Mahal in particular. He had a hard time fitting his music into the Blues mold producers wanted him to do. Scorcese makes the same mistake in his opening film in the PBS series, getting Toure to play along with Corey Harris, but you can see that his heart is not in it. Toure is very much his own man and this CD is the most representative of his personal feelings about music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"Ali Farka Toure's \\"Niafunke\\" is one great album, showcasing the West African approach to the guitar, and proving that Toure is getting better with each passing year.

The music can be described as a sort of \\"Sahara blues\\", a mix of North and West African traditional music and American blues, but there's much more to it than that.

The 10 inch/80 tooth full kerf industrial Freud blade (LU85R010)that I put on my miter box makes crosscuts on endgrain so smooth that it actually shines in reflected light.

Additionally, there seems to be a problem with the controller of the unit -- intermittantly, if you hit 2 pads at the same time, only one will sound; this is similar to problems other people are having with the iED01, so, I think the units share some internals that suffer from design flaws."},{"rating":"2","title":"Parrot CK3400 LS is almost everything.","review":"The CK3400 LS GPS model works very good.

But this phone did not sync any contacts at all and made it very hard to use. It would still allow you to talk and answer phone calls but you could not dial from your contacts.

This movie is self-indulgent, poorly written, poorly acted (read that again: poorly acted. I'm serious.), and amateurishly edited. It has a couple of sexy scenes with its out-of-shape ex-porn star star, and I think that's the only reason it got a distribution deal.I saw Homewrecker at a film festival in November of 2009, and by the end of the film the whole audience started walking out, even though the director was still up on stage doing a Q and A.The only market this film will have is gay guys who will rent anything gay-themed and don't care how poorly done and just plain stupid it is.If my own gag reflex weren't so thoroughly deadened, I would have walked out of this film long before the lame ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time and money","review":"Not all low budget productions are bad, unfortunately this dose not apply to Homewrecker it is bad, very bad.

Good science fiction is full of social, political, and even religious commentary. Until seeing this episode again recently, it had stuck with me for I do not know how many years. After all that time, I remembered the strong message about the foolishness of discrimination and hate this episode had to offer.

The entire cast was cardboard, no zest, it was as though they were trapped in a contract and were doing their least to fulfull it. The plot was weak, if not non-existent. The stunts were boring and ill-timed. The video was a waste of money and not worth watching, unless you like the 10 seconds of T&A in the nudist camp. I didn't.

Justice is talking to some floozie about something...and she offers him a 'good time'. He replies \\"I'm interested in pursuit, not partytime.\\" Unfortunately, the dubbing department didn't do a very good job of superimposing the word \\"partytime\\" over what Gleason actually said...which also started with 'p', had two syllables and referenced the female anatomy.

The F word is known to have been in use since the 1400s. Back then, it meant to destroy or spoil. Its use to describe the act of copulation has been in existence since the late-1600s. The C word is even older than the F word, and has been in use since the early 1300s. So, contrary to what various reviewers have said previously, Ms. Johnson IS entirely accurate to have Regency era characters use these words, vulgar as such may be.Information about the historical appearance of English words is available in the book, English through the Ages, by William Brohaugh. It was published in 1998 by Writers Digest Books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another keeper by Susan Johnson","review":"Legendary Lover is a wonderfully light novel about sex, society, and secrets in nineteenth century England. Susan Johnson is known for her inventive love scenes, and this book certainly doesn't lack in that respect. I do disagree, however, with the reviewer who said that sex was all that Venus and Jack's relationship is based on. The main point of Jack's attraction to Venus is that she is different from all the society belles he has known: she has a brain and thinks for herself. Johnson's novels of late all feature this same sort of independent female lead character and it makes for some intriguing dialogue and situations. It's true that this book doesn't have as much plot as some of Johnson's older ones, but you probably won't care because the characters are so interesting. And the sex is as hot as is to be expected from Susan Johnson.

What was even worse was the abundance of crude conversation throughout the novel. And just when I thought there might be some small hope for redemption, the book ended.The thought of keeping it on my shelf (with my keepers, of all things!!!) was so distasteful that I donated it to the local library.

Undoubtedly, Jack Fitz-James is a \\"legendary lover.\\" Another deviations is that the female lead character is neither a virgin nor a widow, while the hero, typically, is a rake and a rogue. While many writers devote their entire plots to efforts by the hero to bed the girl, this book begins with the couple having sex the second time they meet. Jack arrives at midnight, and after a 10-minute waltz with Venus, he drags her to their hosts' library where they spend hours locked in a fantastic sexual encounter (after she makes him find and borrow some condoms). The use of condoms is something you don't usually find in historical romances either. In spite of the weak plot, this is one you can't put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This is the worst of Susan Johnson book's. It is also the first of her books a read, I almost didn't read any others. The dialogue is forced and contrived. The love scenes are almost indifferant. I wanted to take the characters and slap them both. They are shallow and self center and hard to care about. Luckily I decided to give Ms. Johnson another chance and I have been very pleased with the other books I've read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Romance or Pornography?","review":"Even realizing that authors are integrating explicit sexual scenes more and more in current romance novels, \\"The Legendary Lover\\" makes no effort at a storyline other than sexual exploits. Romance wasn't the theme....sex was. And to add insult to injury...the actions and language seem incongruous to the time depicted in the book.If there were ratings for books, this one would be rated XX. Since there aren't, I will not be relying on the back page in the future for an overview of a story. I don't want to waste good money again on a book such as this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and effort","review":"This is the first Susan Johnson book I have read. I did not appreciate the lack of plot and explicit language used by the characters during the \\"love\\" scenes. The main characters were fairly silly, not to mention unbelievable. At the end of the novel I could not establish how the two had fallen in love. Lust, yes; but love no. It would have been more realistic if they parted as friends; given the fact that they spent too much time in bed, instead of trying to get to know each other. Plenty of action, but alas, no story to hold it together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I was highly disappointed in this book. I remember reading Susan Johnson's beginning books (starting with Sinful) and there used to be some plot with enjoyable characters. The love scenes were steamy, but yet romantic. This book was pure sex and the plot was very weak. I skimmed through most of the book and that didn't take very long, that I returned it the very same day. So unless you enjoy just reading the sex scenes, this will be enjoyable for you, if not then stay clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"god this book is so awful","review":"I have it right now and I'm about 50 pages from the end and I'm not sure if I'll even finish it; it is so dull and lackluster. There is no erotic tension between the characters, the heroine climaxes endlessly, and the hero has no problem getting aroused 4-5 times a night (ouch). In addition to this, the dialogue is full of needless profanity, the descriptions the worst sort of purple prose, and the author seems to have done very little research into the historical period the novel is set in. Just don't buy it; re-read an old favorite instead. I'm serious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ohhh LA LA....HOT...","review":"I love this BOOK!...I've been a fan of Susan Johnson for two years now..and have read most of her books.This book doesnt dissapoint me and it has its usual fire like her other books. I truly recommend this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a historical romance?","review":"The classification on Legendary Lover says historical romance--imagine my surprise when I found myself reading soft porn. I've never read anything by Susan Johnson nor heard of her. The back of the book sounded like two strong willed people getting ready to battle it out. I was expecting great dialogue and witty scenes between the characters. What I got was, no story line and lots of graphic sex. I didn't care for this book and won't buy anything else by the author. If this is erotica, then call it erotica--not historical romance.On another note, did they really use the \\"f\\" and \\"c\\" word back then?

This book provides the right balance of direction and know-how to help transition to a new way of life."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was not for me...","review":"This book is not for me. The premise of the book is to reduce cravings by eating a particular flavor in all of your meals throughout the day. For example, the flavor of the day may be pineapples. With your breakfast, you will have pineapple juice. Your midmorning snack will be pineapple yogurt. Lunch includes pineapple chicken salad. Dinner includes pineapple shrimp and dessert also has fresh pineapple or pineapple rings. Each day has a theme such as raisins, lemon, peach, mushrooms, tomatoes, spinach, etc. This type of strict regiment is not something that I can maintain long term and the recipes are not convenient for most people with somewhat of a busy lifestyle. I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot really recommend this diet.","review":"This falls in the \\"diets don't work\\" file.

Eat less, exercise more. If you do it then it works...rather simple and basic. Save your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"The author develops his ideal diet based on the scientific evidence that we have the ability to sense various tastes, such as sweet, sour, bitter, etc. So far, so good. He then suggests that our brain has set points for these and if we eat one of the tastes, such as sweet, we have to keep eating this until the set point is satisfied. Maybe. Where this falls apart in my mind is his dietary suggestions, supposedly evolved from the above observations. That is, such things as the peach diet, where the only consistency throughout is the \\"peach\\" with plenty of other opportunities for sour, bitter, savory set points being initiated. I consider this book largely just another reworking of other dietary books already available, with the slight twist of discussing taste as an issue, but not really following through with that so well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"I tried this diet and it didn't work for me. Also, the daily meal preparation was a challenge at best, and many questions were not addressed or anticpated in the book. Even though I enjoyed the recipees, I was exhausted after a week of meal planning.I respect Dr katz very much normally, but this was, in the end, a recipee book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I found this book to be just another gimmicky weight loss book. There is written to appeal to those who are plagued by cravings for various foods thus overeating those foods. I found that this diet did nothing to curb those cravings by eating a day of the craved food. I still craved the same food the next day. These cravings are generally stress induced therefore a book on how to better handle stress without using food to distress would be of more benefit. So save your money and buy a book on distressing methods."},{"rating":"1","title":"No breakthrough for me!!","review":"Sorry I bought this book....it wasn't anything that I could follow thru on...guess I'll just stick to watching my 'over active fork'....TJ"},{"rating":"2","title":"little known giant","review":"\\"Scope\\" came up on one of my Pandora stations and WOW!

In addition, it provides many technical details about many systems that affect the revolution in one way or the other.

I'd say that these boots run a little big, however if you're going to put either a liner or wear heavy socks with them (highly recommended), I'd go with your normal size. I'm not a fan of the liners that Hunter makes (I find them a bit tacky looking), but high wool socks will definitely do the trick in cold rain or snow. If you're looking for a fashionable rain boot that will last you forever (literally) BUY these! They are so easy to clean and also very convenient for walks to work in the rain/snow.

This wasn't a problem for me because I had no real use for it, but for those needing a side burner, this grill isn't for you.Other than those two complaints, this grill has served us well over the past three years.

Set entirely on a small mid-forest lake, \\"Spring...\\" tells the simple, yet somehow complex, story of the two Buddhist monks who live there. The story is broken up in to the five seasonal segments, each representing a different time in the younger monk's life, and each segment delivers a beautiful messege.

The cinematography is beautiful throughout. The storyline is interesting and contains some fundamental lessons about life and its cycles. The script is also what fell short for me however. It was a little too simple for my liking. Given the lack of dialogue, or other alternate persuaders, it was difficult for me to believe the young woman was attracted to the young man in the first place. Additionally, the jump to her ultimate fate was too quick. While the wise old man made reference to the outcome earlier in the film it seemed too convenient. I was hoping for some dramatic revelation at the film's conclusion but it never came for me.

It is 93 pages of large type that would be 40 pages of normal text and it adds nothing to the story line. It is just repeating what was already written in his previous work.

The unit was assemble in such a way that the plant light could not be connected at the fixture which required the relocation of the fixture.The design is such that I felt is was worth my time to properly assemble, particularly after receiving no reply to my communication to the manufacturing company.

It's a fine appliance for what I need. I prefer the hot coffe from to drip makers to the not-as-hot coffee from a French press.

It makes it very difficult to pour the water into the reservoir without spilling. And you also have to make sure and SNAP the entire top on before starting the coffe maker or the water doesn't go through the coffee portion when on...it will just sit in the Coffee section and make a big wet soggy overflow mess...

But it drips onto the warming plate every time that you make it pause to pour during brewing, which gradually erodes the surface of that plate and makes the carafe stick to it. It often splatters when you pour from the carafe even after brewing stops. So you end up with coffee splatters all over the coffeemaker and counter. Best alternative: Look for one of the discontinued Krups models on eBay. Brand new ones show up occasionally, even.

The same holds true if you use the carafe to fill the water reservoir. When removing the carafe to pour a cup of coffee during brewing, the maker drips onto the hot-plate causing burning on the plate - contrary to what the manufacturer declares. The cover needs to be closed to keep the coffee basket from pushing up when you place the carafe under the drip maker. We purchased this for our camper.

It brews really quickly, it's not loud and it's very easy to clean. I did freak out once because after it was done brewing, the steam coming out of the top where the coffee grounds are was pretty heavy and i thought the worse. Again...I've never owned a coffee machine until now so I didn't know what to expect. There is quite a bit of condensate that forms but (again) easy to clean the top lid. It's a small machine but that's a plus because our counter space is at a premium these days.

The carafe has an opening too small to get into to clean and it will not fit under a refrigerator water fill door to fill. The top lid for water fill drips condensate all down the back of the appliance when you raise it to remove the basket, the water measurements on the pot and the appliance do not equal the same amounts. Probably the worst thing is the no auto switch-off feature. This is dangerous. I didn't think I would need an auto turn off feature but I was wrong - every appliance like this should auto shut-off.

I did run a few pots of plain water through it before making the first real cup - call me cautious - and had no problems with bitter taste, plastic taste, or any other odd taste. The removable \\"basket\\" is not to be used in place of a filter - it is not a gold mesh filter - it simply helps in removing the paper filter and spent grounds. Without the paper filter you are guaranteed to have bitter coffee not to mention a mess. I bought this to replace a 25 year old Krupps 4 cup machine and I am glad I did! For $14 I don't care if I have to replace the thing every few years - I paid $40 over 25 years ago for my Krupps so get real."},{"rating":"1","title":"Received Sandals","review":"I also ordered the loafers and received sandals.

I am an avid reader, and this is perhaps one of the few books that I have ever disliked.

Their sound has changed, and some of their image has changed. But their motivation has not. The difference now, compared to back then, is they have a stable drummer. We all miss Danzig. But we must remember back then it was a magical time; their songs were an anthem. Graves and Danzig are like night and day. And Michale took on some pretty big shoes to fill. Instead of punk, it is metal. But they still sing about the horror and they still do it for us. They would not of had a reunion otherwise.

There's no denying that Doyle and Jerry Only were key components of the Danzig-era Misfits; yet, for this band to call themselves the Misfits, and even worse, have fans applaud them and their releases, is insane. once again, i don't think this band sucks, far from it, but without Danzig it's not the Misfits but rather a second, no, third rate version of the Misfits trudging along and trying to recap what the band once was. Without the Key ingredient, the primary creative force of the orignial band, this is nothing more than a disgrace to the Misfits name. Face it folks, it's like trying to bake a cake without flour...."},{"rating":"2","title":"...eh","review":"despite what everyone says about neo misfits, i think they do have some decent songs. although the songs aren't well written, michale graves vocal range is better. this album is better than american psycho in more because it was too metal most likely cause of the metal band jerry(moe the great) and doyle had after misfits. this only gets alittle closer to the bands roots with more simplistic and clean guitar playing, and more subjects than just murder(still alot). if mike graves didn't leave the band i'd say another album released together would of been in close competition with the old days. best album to get out of the three, try getting the jap version for extra tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Massive Disappointment","review":"I actually really dug \\"American Psycho\\", but this album just falls flat.

Danzig wrote all the old Misfits songs and when he left, the Misfits died. Why Jerry feels the need to ruin the legacy of what was once one of the greatest punk outfits and influential bands of their day is simply a mystery to me? Just listen to Saturday Night. Could you imagine Glenn singing \\"I was crying on Saturday night\\"? This is not punk, it is not the misfits and it is definitely not good.

Without Glenn, Jerry Only and Doyle decided to steal the name and produce this embarassment.

The Virtual Lab is not the best simulator but is suitable for preparing for the test."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"Lammle's book helped me get my ccna with a score of 860. The strong points of the book are his way of explaining and breaking down router configuration and protocols. There are what I believe to be slip ups though. Wan protocols seemed to be thrown in at the last minute with minimul explanation. There are errors or typos in the flash cards program for the palm operating system. And the emulator doesnt let you do all of the labs because it only supports a set number of commands. Bottom of the line to me is the fact that I got my ccna. And I got it with this book and alot of studying. Study the book, take the practice tests provided and study more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to get certified","review":"This is a great idea: pairing a solid certification book with the simulated lab for hands on experience. You should try to get your hands on a real router, but this is the next best thing. The lab is a bit buggy (and now there is an updated \\"gold\\" version), otherwise this would be 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool, but a little bit extreme...","review":"If you like custom painting, you'll find several -other- nice books about the theme. This is not the only I've got about car painting and custom painting, but in fact, is not the one I like the most...Even if it contains nice step-by-step procedures, and goes with most of the painting proceses you may want to know, is not a great font of inspiration -for me-. It is most like a airbrushing book, that goes even in painting things that I would never paint on cars... and really hate to see on cars...Craig Fraser is surely a very good airbrush painter, but if you are looking for some custom painting, without getting your car out of mind, I'd suggest rather to buy \\"how to paint flames\\" or \\"pinstripping masters\\"... maybe also \\"advanced custom painting technics\\", but not this book.All in all, it is not a bad book, is just not the kind of information I like to have on my library."},{"rating":"2","title":"automotive cheap tricks & special f/x","review":"This is a great book, lots of color photos and great how ideas, loved it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite, poorly written and mush","review":"I found the book terribly written - and filled with cliches. The hero would be about 70 now and I found it extremely difficult to believe that he was sleeping with Bok-Sahn. The author writes about Galvin as if he is in his 40's and the references to WWII made me pause to calculate his age. I also found his Irish Dialogue TERRIBLE and overdone.

They are well written and thought out. Lots of ancient realism, though they are fantasy novels! Though I am not Catholic, these books gave me insight to the Catholic Church's beliefs and taught me much about what certain traditions/customs of the Catholic Church meant. I became extremely involved with the characters; truly caring for and worrying about them as the series carried me through the years of the story. I heartily recommend them to anyone who loves magic, understands what it might be like to be an outcast or different from the accepted \\"norm\\", and/or anyone who loves to get involved in a really believable fantasy world.

I have no interest in her story; I made myself finish the book but the cliffhanger didn't make me interested in getting the next book at all.

I was so disappointed in this book that I'm going to sell it and try to get some of my money back.1st. I have never read a romance novel( and I've read alot)that didn't have romance in it.2nd. I felt like I was reading an action book. It didn't even seem like it was one of her books.3rd. Not one single love scene(and lets be honest that's why we read romance novels right)in the entire book.I guess we have to buy the next one that goes with it but after this one I most likely will not. Where is the old Karen Marie Moning at? I've read her other books at least 3 time each, I want those fantasy's back.I would not spend the money on this one unless you get it alot cheaper, that way you will not feel like you got ripped off like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark Fever","review":"Yet another supernatural/urban fantast series that fails to deliver. It's very shallow and uninvolving, the heroine comes across as a slacker and rather whiney and the hero is brooding and uninteresting. I lost interest around chapter 3 and chucked it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stockholm Syndrome much?","review":"DARKFEVER by Karen Marie Moning. (2.5 stars) Perhaps all the sensational, brilliant, stunningly jaw-dropping writing from other authors is making NYT Best Sellers look like child's-play? I don't know, but I'm not convinced this kind of mediocre writing is inspiring this many people to buy these books. The romance is so convoluted I don't see how anyone could have \\"felt\\" anything for the characters being together romantically. He's an ass, she's being held captive, love connection? Not buying it. Stockholm Syndrome much? No thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Trick","review":"The book just ends as though it is in the middle of the story. I don't mean there is a cliffhanger it just ends. No idea still about her sister; did not find her sister's diary; don't know about adoption; etc., etc.. I was shocked and have really never seen this before. I won't be reading the next book in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too many questions","review":"I realize that DarkFever is the beginning of a new series, but it also is pulling elements from the established Highlander series. After I adjusted to the 1st person POV, it was a good story. But left me with many questions: How/Why did the Unseelie get free? When did the walls between the realms come down and why? Did something happen to the MacKeltar's that voided the Compact? Where is Aiobhiel? I thought Adam was the most powerful, dead-sexy Fae - so where did V'lane come from? Who or What is Jericho Barrons? The questions go on and on. Hopefully, BloodFever will answer some of these. Boy, it's going to be a long wait until August 07."},{"rating":"1","title":"just HORRIBLE!","review":"I loved Ms. Moning's Highlander series and was really excited to read this new book (even though I was disappointed she had decided to start a new series rather than continue with the Highlander books). This book was terrible- Mac is annoying and Barrons does nothing for me. I can't believe this is part of a 5 book series- I will not be reading any more. Hopefully after she finishes this series, Ms. Moning will write more books like the Highlander series."},{"rating":"2","title":"DARKFEVER TURNED OUT TO BE A VERY INTERESTING BOOK","review":"The main character is MacKayla (Mac) Lane. Mac is a sidhe-seer, which is someone who can see the true nature of the Fae and are not fooled by Fae glamour or magic, but she can be hurt by them. Her life changes when her sister, Alina, is murdered in Ireland. Mac goes to Ireland despite her parent's disapproval to find out what happened to Alina. Once Mac gets there her whole life is turned upside down again. Alina left a message for Mac telling her to find the Sinsar Dubh and that a man who she thought loved her was one of them and out to get her. The problem with this is that Alina didn't tell her how to find the Sinsar Dubh or her boyfriend's name. Now the action starts.DARKFEVER is a fast paced, well written book. I liked the storyline, I like the paranormal suspense, and the characters are well developed. This is book one in the FEVER series and I look forward to reading book two, this was a fun read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Starts off slow, but turns into amazing...","review":"Ok, let me start off by saying that I agree with many of the \\"bad\\" or negative reviews posted... MacKayla Lane is a self-centered, annoying, ditzy, blond bimbo... at first. Having lived in the south for a few years, I have actually known women like MacKayla Lane. Her character in Book One really didn't annoy me as much as some reviewers because I saw the potential for growth in the character and felt the author was making a point.One of the best things about this series is how the heroine transforms from your typical southern belle into an ass-kicking sidhe-seer. Book one, Darkfever, is just the beginning of this transformation. The other characters, the plot, and the setting (Dublin, hello!) made me continue reading the series and I am very glad I did.I would encourage those with mixed feelings about Darkfever to try reading Book Two, Bloodfever. I'm sure MacKayla Lane will surprise you given the chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"fever series","review":"Awesome and addicting, finished all five in two months, could not put down and have not been able to find a comparable series to read next.

I would give negative stars if I could.I got this book through the Kindle deal. I am not a romance reader, I don't know the writer, never read her previous works. I don't think I will. Ever!The plot is boring, it is not leading to anywhere. The characters are weak.The heroine is a mindless town girl, whose biggest fear in the world is the discontinuing of a some stupid pink shade nail color. She is taking time to describe her clothes and hair (in her journal) even when she is chased by an evil fae.The author keeps describing her barbie like like matching pink outfits through the book. Half of the book is filled w/ outfit, hair and make up descriptions.I was glad when it was over.Even for the Kindle experimenting, keep away from this book, seriously. Buy a real book.It is an insult to your intelligence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrated","review":"I love her books but I was very frustrated at how it left me feeling incomplete!

YEP the true colors shining through are greed. All this author wants is to split up what could have been ONE awesome book into 5 different parts so she can make more money.Yes, the first book in the series was free on kindle....but that's where they hook you in. At the end of the first book, I felt there should be SOME resolution and that the story should tell more about the characters. WRONG....it feels like each book is just a reincarnation of the same theme.First book was free, second book FIVE bucks, third book SIX plus bucks, and the fourth book was TEN bucks...minus a penny. The last book in the series doesn't come out until 2011. I feel utterly ripped off. I feel like I wasted my time and I wish I'd never read the first book. I'll never pay for another book from this author again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worthwhile","review":"I guess this book just isnt up my alley, as I could not even get past the prologue.

I bought this book like everyone else with preconceived ideas...and no it's not exactly a romance but the storyline which to me is most important painted a picture of a world her other books danced around. If your impatient this isn't for you, but if you can wait I truly think this series will be worth it. This book pulled me in and didn't let go. I can't wait for the next installment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A self absorbed and defenseless main character","review":"I hate this book beyond belief. The book lacks a little thing called substance. I wanted to just strangle the main character Mac. She was a little defenseless Barbie stereotype, whose delicate southern female sensibilities were hurt when somebody so much as cursed! She cant lift a finger to defend herself, and would rather slouch off her parents with a part time job, work on her tan, then do ANYTHING. It had immense potential when it came to plot but the characters made it unenjoyable. Jericho was a horrible character who did nothing but yell, bruise, and order Mac around. None of the characters are well written and have as much substance as a toilet brush, not to mention that Mac is the most worthless excuse for a heroin in any book I have read so far. Don't wast your money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I thought this story was very incomplete...I also did not like the 1st person voice. Not comparable to previous books. I won't buy a hardcover book from this author again.

I knew this was going to be different because the author warned us.

I will read the next installment and if the storyline does not improve, I will not read another."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting adventure with a fast pace.","review":"I enjoyed the fast pace of this fantasy adventure and will certainly continue reading the Fever Series.

I finished the book last night and was left feeling like it never really got started. Sure things happened, but there was never a real climax and definitely not a satisfying ending. Eventhe action/scary parts wre dull, because they were all delivered in the first person of the very dull \\"Mac\\" who is more like a limp noodle with nail polish than anybody I wanted to know better.The premise was good, so I kept reading.

I really wanted this to be good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrifyingly awful heroine","review":"I'm adding my one-star rating with the others just to counter all of the glowing reviews. I was baffled and disgusted by the inane heroine. I felt like my mind needed to be scrubbed and disinfected after reading this book - which I only finished because I kept thinking, \\"no, it couldn't possible get worse\\". If you took her out of the story it still wasn't difficult to miss the fact that in this fantasy it is clearly a man's world, and women are just there to serve, in any way, preferably in stilettos."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT","review":"This is another one of the many series that I have read this summer and, as the rest of them, it is excellent. I love the female main character and I absolutely think that the male characters are awesome as well.

These are mostly love/romance novels and they're very well done. But, while in the midst of all them, I discovered her darker novels, those in the \\"Fever\\" series and these are way good reading, too. More about good and evil instead of falling in love with your soul mate. Never a dull moment....Miss Moning keeps the action coming. Her main characters are never still or boring; they're full of action and optimism. And I like that a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book One of the Fever/MacKayla Lane Series","review":"Holy cow! What a ride. I have the audio version and the narrator really enhanced the story. The southern accent and voice matched the character perfectly.MacKayla Lane, the main character, is like an adult version of Buffy, the Vampire Slayer. And instead of being at war with Vamps, it's Fae she'll be fighting. I think for those who miss the Buffy days, this will be a welcomed experience. I can't to get the next two audios in this series.Awesome book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"thank goodness it was a free Kindle book","review":"Unlike most who reviewed this book, I'd never heard of the author or her books before. Given the quality of this book, I sure ain't gonna read any more of them. Not one of the characters is likeable, especially the main character. Annoying! The stream-of-consciousness first-person writing is embarrassing to read, so cloying, and such an obvious attempt to create a cute but ditzy heroine. Like all of the free Kindle books, this book was meant to entice us into buying more from this author. No way!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not my usual genre","review":"This isn't my usual genre, but it's hard to put this book into a genre. It has elements of sci-fi, paranormal, adventure and a little romance.What I like best about the book is the writing. This gal has talent. Well done, tight and concise in character development, dialogue, and action.What I didn't like is the fact that this book doesn't end, it's not a stand alone, but a continuation that lasts for 5 books. Having said that, I'll still continue the series because I thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read the Entire Series!","review":"I just finished this whole series. I was enthrawled chapter after chapter and could not pyut it down. Mac and Jerrico's relationship sometimes wants to make you pull your hair and infuriates you. The story really gives amazing ups and downs. It gives you cliff hangers and heart stoppers but definitely gives an amazingly full story and paints a world that you feel is real. She does so amazingly at wrapping it all in at the end and left me happy but wanting to start all over again with the first book. PLEASE READ THESE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is she tired of romance?","review":"One of the things I really look forward to is the arrival of a new KMM novel. But, I am afraid I have to agree with some of the reviewers that this one is a stinker. KMM writes some of the best heroes in the business and Jericho was one but he had no romance!! Nothing for him to do!!! Mac was sort of iffy for me. She was okay but I really wish this had been a straight romance. The only romance in it was Mac and the lusty fairy. I didn't like that. You have someone like Jericho Barrons around and nothing for him?I didn't like this book--I borrowed it from the library. This is the first KMM book that I didn't buy and put on my keeper shelf. Until she goes back to her basics, I will be visiting the library when she has something new out. And I won't hurry.BTW, the cover was a stinker,too."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money!","review":"I totally hated the main charactor- MacKayla....her arrogance was only superceded by her stupidity!!! She goes to a strange country, totally ignores warnings; is rude and so busy 'cracking wise' she invariably gets innocent people hurt and killed!! This could have been a good book if the writer were not so intent in trying to write like Laurell K. Hamilton! I read both the 1st and 2nd book (unfortunately I had purchased them at the same time) and they just left me more upset with the heroine than ever...I won't bother to read the 3rd book as frankly, I don't care what happens to her! I hope Barrons sees the light and lets her just die! what a waste of time! Oh and Mac ~ Barrons is a vampire for goodness sake, couldn't you figure that out already? Anyone want to buy my copies? $5.00 a piece! Still new with perfect dust covers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark Fever","review":"Let's be honest, Dark Fever was not what I expected. Where's the romance? What happened to two people falling in love and enjoying meaningful lust in the midst of a little conflict. Dark Fever was filled with lust with out any emotional ties. To me lust without romance is simply porn. I was really disapponted. In fact,it reminded me of the time the powers that be decided to change coke into new coke. If the rest of the series is anything like the first - I'll pass. I think I'll just console myself with the well read highlander series and wait until Karen decides to pull out her original formula again. What a royal let down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Deception","review":"I purchased this book because I have enjoyed reading this author. I was terribly disappointed in Darkfever. First it moved so slowly with little action and pages of boring exposition. It lacked romance and even the attempt at the beginnings of lust were flat. I found myself scanning the pages hoping for something better. When the book ended without resolving even one mystery, I was horrified. What a waste of my time. Also what a shameless ploy to sell books. If I want to know more I can by the next book which happens to be a more expensive hardcover. I can tell you I am not pre-ordering that volume. Also in reading the author's question and answer section I see that the story of Mac won't end in the next book. I have no problem with a continuing character. In fact I like it but each book must have some resolution or the buyer must be warned that this is only part one of a continuing story not book one of a continuing series. If I could I would be asking for my money back"},{"rating":"1","title":"3 days I will never get back","review":"This book was neither thrilling nor romantic in any way. \\"Ms. Lane\\" is a bubble headed annoying protagonist and I prayed for her demise many times. I can only hope that the plethora of foreshadowing in this opening series will eventually lead to something, but alas, I will not be reading another Fever book to find out. I feel the $1.99 I paid was $2.00 too much. I generally devour 300 pages in less than a day, but I choked on this book for 3 days, hoping something good would come of it. The writing is so superficial and terribly redundant. My husband asked while I was reading if it was a roller coaster & I told him it wasn't even a merry-go-round. Bottom line...skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mac","review":"A wonderful series of books and storytellers filled with fantasies.However, the lead character, Mac, is without doubt the most irritatingand insulting of any character in any fiction. The series would have been so much betterif this babbling whiner disappeared. I listened to all the books on audio CDs.If I could I would fast forward every time the reader opened her mouth.Just simply irritating....!!!!1"},{"rating":"2","title":"suprising","review":"suprised at how much i enjoyed the book. getting ready to download the rest of the series!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Five Books before the Story Line Ends!!!!!","review":"I love Karen Marie Moning's writing and have read all her books. However, if a story line is going to continue with cliff hangers at the end of each of the books, there should be a warning in bold print on the front page about the ongoing story line!!! Five books before we receive the answers to questions asked in the first book is ridiculous!!! I have quit reading other authors who tried this tact to get their books sold. I hate to think I will have to give up Ms. Moning, but I will if this is how she plans to write in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sméagol?","review":"So I have actually been listening to this as a podcast, which I am entirely grateful for, because truthfully it's just not a story worth paying for. If you're interested, check it out at the library. Whatever you do don't buy the audiobook! The reader is the same in both the audiobook and the podcast, and while she does well coming across as a an empty headed teen girl, she sounds like Sméagol (from lord of the rings) when she's attempting male voices."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was ok but not memorable.","review":"I found this book to be an ok read. I found Mac the main character to annoying and shallow, way to obsessed with her appearance. The detailed descriptions of Mac clothes and appearance were way over done. When I read a book I really don't care if a character's outfit matches her pink manicure and pedicure. Maybe in the next books the author won't be as descriptive. I don't find the main characters likable and the story dragged. But I did finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darkfever","review":"I can hardly wait for the next book. I have so many questions, but I know Karen Moning will come through with all the answers. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves Karen Moning writings.

I still enjoyed the story line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great beginning to series","review":"I read lots of paranormal and I thought this book was really good. The good guys are interesting and the monsters are bad. It does have a cliffhanger but by now the series is finished so all the books are out so you don't have to wait.

I loved the \\"Highlanders\\" books and expected this book to be the start of another equally enjoyable series. No such luck! The main female character MacKayla Lane (O'Connor) is really boring and she rambles on and on about irrelevant rubbish. The book could have been condensed to half the size and still the reader would still not have missed anything of the essential plot. Mind you what Plot? That is also so thin I can't believe this is the same author who wrote the \\"Highlander\\" series. As for the main male character, Jericho Barrons, well he is totally unbelievable and certainly has no redeeming qualities. Maybe the next in this series will be better, who knows? All I know is I won't be buying it, maybe I will get it from the Library. I own all of the \\"Highlander\\" books but I won't be buying this series. I hope Karen writes some more of the \\"Highlander\\" books soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the typical Karen Marie Moning novel","review":"I picked up Darkfever not knowing anything about it specifically, but because I have read several books by this author and loved them. Be warned, this book is not in the same genre as her previous books. She builds on the Fae theme, but this book is not an historical romance with great characters, an interesting story and laced with humor. It is a dark book full of evil characters and a story that isn't so great. I didn't connect with any of the main characters (Mac irritated me) and was shocked to find a book filled with vampires, monsters and violence. I don't read those kind of books for a reason, I don't like them and I certainly didn't like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT HAPPENED?","review":"I just loved Karen's Time travel series, but when I started to read her new series, I was VERY disapointed!She is such a good writer, but her new series is, well, not good....I wish she would return to the writing she does best..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Everyone is an Understatement","review":"I'm actually kind of fascinated over how in the world any author could have found a character like \\"Mac\\" fascinating enough to write about. I was too annoyed with her to be fascinated. One more mention of a pastel color, or the word \\"petunia,\\" and I would have thrown up. Seriously.Jericho didn't fare any better in my estimation. Another extremely annoying character. I felt nothing for either of these people and don't wish to continue their story in the hope that I might someday understand why the author was fascinated with them.Sorry, Karen....love your other stuff...and this one could have been fascinating. Parts of it were interesting and had potential for me. I just hated your characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I just finished the last page and I loved it. I hate buying hardcovers (can't fit them in a purse), but I know I'm going to get Bloodfever as soon as it comes out. It felt like this book was a mix between a \\"normal\\" Moning story and one of Charlaine Harris' Sookie books. Full of suspense, a little desire (wanted or not), and good inner dialogue from the main character. Definitely a page turner."},{"rating":"1","title":"not recommended","review":"Can't recommend anyone start this series. Books are installments, not stand-alone stories and get more depressing and unsatisfactory as it drags out. Two male leads are domineering and abusive, if you're into that, rape theme runs thru first three books (so far) and heroine starts as a weak sort of Buffy the Vampire Slayer (minus campy humor and interesting friends) and gets darker and more pathetic. This book just kind of sets the scene without resolving anything, and isn't much fun. The 'ick' factor increases in subsequent books. Really disappointing for fans of this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome start to the series","review":"After not reading fiction for about 20 years this was recommended to me and reawakened my love of reading so much have been reading ever since. Its the first of a series told over five books so don't expect the answers at the end of each book. Luckily all five are now available so the cliff hangers are easier to bear.The characters develop over the course of each book. You get to see Mac grow from a 22 year old carefree color me pink girl to a saviour of the world vision in black, and although the journey is arduous and life threatening at times its well worth hanging on for the ride of your life.Often found in the romance section this is certainly not your usual romance so don't expect hearts and flowers but does have a romantic thread evolving throughout the series.Looking forward to more books in the Fever WorldBloodfever: The Fever Series (A Mackayla Lane Novel)Faefever: The Fever SeriesDreamfever: The Fever SeriesShadowfever"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a romance - an excellent, spellbinding ride...","review":"This book is classified as a romance - it definitely is not one. Die hard romance readers who expect hot romance will be dissapointed.This is an excellent, spellbinding book about the dark forces of the Fae world invading the earth through portals in Ireland. MacKayla Lane goes to Ireland after her sister is murdered to find her killer. What she finds there is magical and utterly horrifying.This is an excellent book. It has a firm place on my keeper shelf. I'm looking forward to reading the second installement in the series. I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Left me hanging...","review":"I was looking for some mindless quick reading and ended up finding a book series that sucked me in. Hey it is fiction, but some of the story line was seriously hokey, but it kept me coming back for more. The end was not done as well as it could have been done. Overall if you like paranormal fiction this is a decent read, I will certainly be checking out the next book to see if the story line improves but honestly as far as paranormals I have read go, this one ranks right there with the rest of them. I give it a 4."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darkfever","review":"This is an excellent series of books that are well written and keep you wanting more Fever!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"Personally, I'm a romance fan. When I learned this was not a romance novel, I put off reading it for months. I'm glad I finally did. I really enjoyed this book. Mac has traveled to Dublin to try and solve the murder of her sister. Once she is there, she learns a great deal about her sister and herself. She also learns that a war is coming between man and the Fae and that she is powerful weapon within that war."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good beginning","review":"I just finished This book, and I am excited to read the rest of the series.

I had read a lot of good reviews on another book site and thought I'd give it a try. I ordered the first three in the series from Amazon because I purchased them for $1, and I'm so glad I did! I finished the first book yesterday and can't wait to start the 2nd!! It was very well written, flowed nicely, exciting and intriguing.....and I loved the 2 main characters!

I also thought the series puttered out and lost my interest around the third book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series","review":"I read this first book and have been stuck on the series ever since. New and refreshing storyline. Nicely written. Really pulls you into the world Moning created."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressed","review":"Unimpressed is being nice actually. I understand having flawed characters. In fact, most of my favorite characters in literature are the really flawed ones. But in her attempt to make her charactets \\"flawed\\" the author just made them flat. The story seemed forced. The interactions between Mac and Barrons were superficial. The idea of bad faeries breaking into our world was great. Its a shame the author was unable to write it well."},{"rating":"1","title":"A feverishly bad read","review":"Moning always gets a lot of positive kudos on the Amazon forums, so when Darkfever was offered free on Kindle, I thought why not try one of her novels.Unfortunately this doesn't seem to be a good book to start reading Moning. I gather it is book one of a five book series. However, there wasn't much in this book that made me want to read the next four. The heroine seemed weak and at least for me not very likeable as she seems very immature. The hero on the other hand seems rather aggressive and too strong for the heroine. They don't seem to have much chemistry or much in common emotionally.The end of the book leads you to the next book in the series. I guess since this is my first Moning book, I would not recommend it for others reading this author for the first time. It might have been better to start with one of her better known Highlander books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't prepared....","review":"After reading the whole Highlander series of novels--(And I have read them all--several will always be favorites) -- I was expecting romance and a challenging plot--I got the challenging plot--but I wasn't expecting a mystery/thriller with nothing more then foreplay by imagination and a little old kiss--not even really decribed at the end....Yes, I was disappointed! I didn't buy this book because I was looking for a mystery/thriller---I would have enjoyed it anyway if it had smacked even a little of romance.....I will be leery of the next publication. . . unfortunately Ms. Moning has moved on to a sphere of entertainment I'm not overly interested in.Why the cover--with two naked people on it--when these two never got naked at all...Why wasn't the genre of this book stated openly on the cover--instead the reviews on the back were all about romance...it made for a very misleading sales pitch for this book..and I find THAT very disturbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please tell me our heroine gets hacked into a million pieces soon....","review":"I am still trying to get through this....I usually devour Ms. Moning's work in hours...it has been almost a week and I am dreading picking it up again.

I am keeping my fingers crossed that this will get better or that I will at lest have some closure and Mac is severed from this series forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"surprisingly great!","review":"I did not want this book initially. The dark mysterious man is named Jericho Barrons for goodness sake!! It just seemed too cliche, like a dime store romance. But it was free or .99 and I couldn't find anything else so I bought it and I'm glad I did. I loved this book! It just sucked me right in! It really has it all, action, adventure, suspense, and some romance, but the good kind :). I finished it and immediately bought the rest of the series and have enjoyed every one."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not supposed to be Romance...","review":"DarkfeverEDITED REVIEW: 4 StarsI was expecting ROMANCE and I didn't get it. I bought this not knowing KMM had said this series wouldn't be the romance series of the Highlanders. It does, however paralell the Highlanders. The character, Mac, is a fru fru southern girl, not altogether annoying more like cluless. Being a southern girl myself, I get her. Barrons is a brooding Alpha Male that isn't easy to deifne. Mac's sister has been murdered and she goes to Ireland only to learn there's more to life the pink nail polish, and accessorizing an outfit. If you are expecting romance, look elsewhere, but do give it a chance. I am not disappointed in this book since I now know what the series is supposed to be. This series gets better, and the Keltar men begin making an appearance in the second book Bloodfever. It is a lot darker than what she normally writes, but it was written really well. Give it a chance and hopefully I've given you enough to know what to expect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Darkfever","review":"I was at first very excited to have an author that has a slightly different way of telling the romance such as timetravel included with paranormal. But just having recently purchased Darkfever,it was such a hugh disappointment. Beginning with the very first page the shallowness of the main character ie MAC, what follows is mainly death and destruction. Any romance at all? A few sexually sick Fae's, and a kiss between Mac and Jerrico three pages before the end. I will wait until I read all of the reviews after any new books from Karen Marie Moning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time, move on.","review":"Don't bother reading this book. I read it because it was recommended by readers who liked the Outlander Series (by Diana Gabaldon), but this is not in the same ball park as that series. Not even the same sport. I am rarely moved enough to write a review, but I was so under-whelmed by this book I just had to. It is so far-fetched (yes, I know it's fantasy, but really?), has no redeeming characters....even the protagonist is such a \\"pretty\\" nuisance, you will find yourself cheering when she breaks one of her manicured pink nails. And the death-by-sex fae characters are hilarious. I guess it might be worth a chuckle or two; hence the one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Doubt it's 2 stars","review":"This is the first book by this author that I have read. My first impression from reading the back is that this was going to be a great new series for me to pick up. Unfortunately I was wrong.I was annoyed that the main character never grew a back bone. This first book should have defined the character and where the characters personality was going. By the end of the book I was so sick of the main character I just stopped reading. I stopped caring about what happened to her sister or Barron. A person cannot go from small town, never had anything bad happen to them to big city half way across the world surrounded by death and not get over pink ice nail polish that match silver sandals. By the end of this book you should have started to see a person who is starting to mature and find their purpose.Ooh and I was tired of the word demarcation which seemed to be used every other page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a Let Down...","review":"I am such a fan of Karen Marie Moning. I preordered this book and was very excited to receive it. As others said...I should've read the author's plog before purchasing. This was such a let down. The main character 'Mac' was phenomenally annoying. It was hard to get through. I am faintly curious to know what happens next, but not enough to buy the next installment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious...Don't waste your money!","review":"Darkfever represents a departure from KMM's usual style in that it is in the first person. The heroine is chatty, informative and really, really boring. I get the impression that KMM was trying for something as cute as Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum novels and as edgy as Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake, but the result is dreadful! To make matters worse, Nothing is resolved, the romantic \\"sparks\\" are almost non-existent, and this book is only a set up for the next one. I feel used.KMM is a hot writer. She has never failed me before. I buy her books, IN HARDCOVER, on sight, without even reading the description. I have recommended her to many people looking for a good read. But this was not even worth the paper it was printed on. I hope she returns to her \\"formula\\" soon. I miss it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying attempt at a young adult book","review":"This is the first book I have read by the author. Will not be reading more. I blustered past the \\"mini skirt, high heels\\" crap but it did not get better. The main character is 22 and she calls other people adults. And the slang is annoying also. I love books about the fae. This is not a book about the fae but a book that has the fae in it and is about the main character who is boring and not very smart. Try Patricia Briggs (I got the author's name in a review of hers, boy was that person wrong to compare them), or Laurel K. Hamilton. No comparison."},{"rating":"1","title":"highlanderluver","review":"As much as I love Karen Marie Moning this book really didn't do it for me. I could have bought another book and heard about this book from someone else. I feel as though I waisted my money on it.

I wouldn't classify it as romance though. I kept me on my toes. I enjoyed it and plan on reading the whole series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good starting point for her new series.","review":"I've read all of Karen Monings books. I can see where some readers may be distressed at her new book because it does not align with the structure of her previous books - a very sexy, happily ever after storyline encompassed in one book.However, I'm glad to see that she strayed from the ordinary because you can only write so many books with the same formula. I think that this was a good starting point of what's to come, it was darker and the heroine (though a bit ditzy at times) has potential. This is definitely worth the read and I can't wait until the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful..........","review":"Picked up this book a few days ago and WOW really enjoyed it. I didn't really care about the romance factor especially at the end when Jericho and Mac have readched a new level in their relationship. Started off fast and didn't end they're. Mac's sister Alina is suddenly murdered and Mac rushes to Ireland to find the murderer not knowing what awaits her. Jericho Barrnes suddenly appears and becomes a big Pain in her life. I highly recommend this book even low on the romance scale, because if you read book the romance is still they're. Can't wait to Bloodfever now,so many unanswered questions. Highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Value for your dollar","review":"I do not want to say I didn't like the book at all since I enjoy Karen's writing so much, but I was so disappointed. I am afraid \\"fever\\" is one series I will not be reading unless I find the books in a second hand store. I didn't find out anymore about the story at the end of the book then I did in the first few chapters. Mac sees fae objects and feas (good and bad). Jericho Barrins is either a good guy or the devil in disguise. Mac's sister is still dead and we don't know who killed her or where her journal is. I always pre-order all of Karen's books, but when the price is $20.00 per book I expect a complete story not a very long prologue. . Karen states this is the first of 5 books about the same story plot, $120 is way out of my budget for 5 incomplete stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"FABULOUS new series!!!","review":"Wow! I didn't think anything could top Moning's Highlander series, but now I know she's been keeping the good stuff for last. Know the world that's been the background of her Highlander books? It's the foreground of the new series. We finally get to learn more about Adam's race, the Seelie and the Unseelie. Mac is an amazing character, one I could totally relate to. Jericho is a gorgeous enigma and V'lane, well, he's downright terrifying with all that sex appeal, which is what I think Moning intended. As far as waiting for the next book, sure I wish I had it now, but I wish I had the next Harry Potter now too. Don't let the negative reviews fool you. The characters are complex, the plot rips you along and I think it's Moning's best work yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm looking forward to seeing how this series develops","review":"I love KMM's Highlander Series, and I think I'm going to love this new series as well! It's completely different and frankly, refreshing written in first person. I like the characters she has selected for this series, and it will be interesting to watch them develop over the 5 books planned. For romance-diehards, this book is not for you. It's a mystery/crime novel more than anything, and is set in modern-day. It has the fantasy elements Ms. Moning is known for, and is definitely not a period piece. There is no tidied-up ending - actually, there is no ending. So beware if you were expecting something along her Highlander Series."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bridge book to nowhere","review":"First disappointment came when I realized by page three the book was going to be in the first person with only one perspective. Personally, find this style not conducive to the romantic genre... which should have clued me in because it wasn't a romance book at all. It is a \\"who-done-it\\" and not a very good one at that. I know this book is part of larger storyline within a series, but I still think each book within a series should be able to stand on its own... and this one doesn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Romance?","review":"I picked up this book looking for something that wasn't there at all. I thought this would be an interesting combination of two of my favorite genres, fantasy and romance. At no time at all did the main character have any sort of relations with any other character...not even a true friendship. The story was just okay. I have read books written for teenagers which had more depth and were more interesting than this book. I will never read one of her 'so-called' romances again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Boring","review":"While I was browsing around at the library, I noticed that this book had an, ahem, interesting cover and the summary seemed interesting too, so I decided to check it out. How glad I am that I just got it from the library and didn't buy it.Instead of being a romance like the cover suggested, this book is more like an adventure/mystery book. An extremely bad adventure/mystery book. It's about the heroine trying to find out who killed her sister, but I couldn't bother caring, as I found her completely boring. The book gets so wrapped up in its fae plot that I found it didn't develop her at all and left a big cliffhanger ending. Even worse, this book didn't even contain what I was looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"beware the \\"Irish\\" accent","review":"What started as a story that could have been a mildy entertaining read, turned out to be a dissapointment bordering on the insulting.For all the research the author must have done in order to give decent descriptions of places in Dublin and use of the Irish language, she completely lost me at her first dialogue of the main character with an Irish character. Irish people do not speak like that. I quote:\\"Evenin' t'ye, m'dear,\\" the desk clerk said cheerfully.

I kept reading and reading and could barely put the Kindle down. Then, just as things got incredibly exciting the book ended. Lucky for me, the next book was already written and available on Kindle so I could pick up where I left off.

This title could have been condensed to a couple of chapters prefacing this tangent to KMM's series. In reading Darkfever, I did something I would never have thought possible with a KMM book.

I don't plan to read anything else in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"DARKFEVER by Karen Marie Moning","review":"After waiting so very long for Ms. Moning's book, I was extremely disappointed. I found myself skipping pages looking for something as exciting as her Highlander series.There was no development of sexual tension or romance between the heroine and the hero.

The story plodded along, dragging the audience with it, hoping for something, ANYTHING, more to like. The actors seemed more interested in picking up their paycheck, than working in this bomb. The whole point of science fiction films is to have some sort of science involved in the story, however my friend and I laughed out loud when the actors in Antarctica never had condensation billowing from dialogue. The story was so unbelievebly obvious and heartless, that I won't even bother describing it for anyone remotely interested in reading this. Save your money, buy the video game and play on line. Anderson shouldn't be allowed to make films anymore after this obtrusive, brainless drivel. Ridley Scott and John McTiernan should take legal action for this cinematic serial killing. Hare Kare (the ancient Japanese samurai suicide) was what I needed to get through that debacle. If I only had a sword at the theatre."},{"rating":"1","title":"A wasted opportunity - what was it about???","review":"Alien! Predator! The fact of the matter is that this movie sucks. I didn't care one iota about ANY of the characters and I completely HATED how the Predator toward the end shows something resembling benevolence, completely removing his aura of mercilessness. Like the people in it, I can hardly remember what the story was about. It was obviously weak. I will say the fight between the two has its moments but it doesn't come close to epic status befitting these two legendary creatures. The final seconds are okay, I guess, but it's nothing more than a cliched tease for a possible sequel (at least that's what the producers must be clamoring for). Ultimately it is a failure because I totally forgot about it soon after watching it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but it could have been better!","review":"I'm a big Alien and Predator fan and I couldn't wait to see these two iconic monsters in the ultimate showdown but before I saw AVP I had many questions about the other Alien and Predator films. For example, why did predators kill men but not women and where the hell did they come from?Overall, in terms of action and CGI Paul W.S. Anderson did terrificly. Good BUT in terms of plot. WHAT THE HELL! A pyramid 20'000 feet under the ground. Predators hunting aliens for sport. Humans are slaves. Come on! I wanted questions solved not have more questions. I also feel Anderson failed to create tension and make the monsters scary unlike the other films.By all means, watch the film. It's good but it could have been better. All AVP fans will agree but I still loved it. AVP and non-AVP fans alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"at best matinee fare","review":"I went to the movie with low expectations and they were met barely. The visuals were good and the fight scenes were excellent but overall, the humans are soo incredibly stupid. \\"Gee what made that tunnel appear so we can get down to the pyramid\\" \\"lets not seperate\\" and other brillant things that made me think of a typical teenage slasher film.SPOILERThe fight with the queen reminded me of aliens, could have been more original and the end scene with the dead predator belongs in every B-grade movie made and says hi Im coming back for a sequel all over it.I like Lance Hendrickson but he was wasted in this movie except for making a continuity sequence for the movies. The other actors were just cannon fodder and to show you how bad the aliens and predators were."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waiste $20 for a couple of worthless scenes","review":"With an unrated version, Anderson had the opportunity to satisy some of us who can't stand PG-13 \\"action horror\\" movies.

It got 1 stars for the first 10 minutes. It got no stars for the rest. not only did they make a pg-13 alien-predator movie, but the plot was so proposterous that it made you feel insulted and embarassed watching it.This could have been such a good movie, and i dont see how anyone with a brain in thier head could destroy a movie with these two facing off, but it happened.Highly recommend it to people that enjoy nonsense movies like the resident evil ones.

Alien vs. Predator did not make sense at all. The Predator being friendly to the lady at the end of the movie just didn't get to me. It was just too awful.

The basic plot is good and makes sense unlike the second Predator film. The effects of the predator are absolutly great especially the Alien vision mode.

I know the Alien series better but thought I should at least watch P1 and P2 before seeing AVP.A few, well many, questions -- What's up with those ugly dreadlocks? Not even organic dreadloacks either. Why are they hunting humans first and Aliens later? Who are these guys and what's up with their bas a** selves?The pyramid idea was cool. The large cast, like JP2; nothing but fodder for later. Not even two characters I could care about coupled with the most insipid directing I've seen. No real motivation for characters, except as victims, no real story, no suspense, so style. Wrong choice for hero also, why try for a Ripley wannabe?It's just an insult to Alien and Aliens (even 3 and 4 stand better on their own). Rent this but don't buy it to put on your shelf with the Alien series. Also, this is not a prequel to Aliens at all - it's big studios making big bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite as good as \\"Freddy Vs. Jason\\", but watchable","review":"My first instinct is to report that this movie really isn't all that good, but when you think about it, how wonderful and subtle and artful could a movie called \\"Alien Vs. Predator\\" actually be? So, I'll be charitable and say that some of the scenarios are interesting (like the continually shifting walls in the pyramid where most of the story takes place) and many of the battles between the two alien species are cleverly staged and fairly fun to watch. Also, the DVD offers a slightly extended cut of the film in addition to the version offered in theaters, as well as some commentaries, so you get a good bit more than just a movie for your rental dollar or purchase price. Still, I wouldn't choose watching this film over actually going out and doing something. But, if it's raining outside and you'd be sitting home anyway, give it a whirl. It's a respectable time-passer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sure it's a fad, but why not....","review":"A good film that is definately on the bandwagon with the horror revival but don't expect to be scared. I think anyone who remotely likes any of the Alien or Predator films can find some fun action filled sci-fi. It's also nice to see Lance Henriksen back on the big sceen in his \\"home\\" genre. In other words go see it, enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT'S A FUN MOVIE","review":"I read these reviews written by these movie intellectuals and I remember why I buy a movie. I buy it because of its entertainment value, not because the director once passed gas on the set or the cinematographer suffered from a case of severe acne. This is a fun movie, filled with action, from the first moment to the last. The sound is awesome, especially if you have a home theater set up, although it was really pretty good when I didn't have one. If you are fan of the Alien flicks, or if you just like a rollicking roll of fun I can recommend this movie, even if one of the lead actors had a pimple."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVP Unrated and still not a good movie.","review":"I managed to get my hands on a copy of AVP Unrated Director's Cut, and if you were expecting to see anything new that wasn't already on the original release, be ready to be let down.The only thing they did was edit in all the deleted scenes that were included on the original disc, and (badly) digitally animate more blood into every human death in the movie. It doesn't work at all. 20th Century Fox must be in desperate need of some extra cash off this stinker.So, trust me when I say this. The original release was better, if you even like the original. But don't give this one a second chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"god this sucked","review":"Boy did this movie really suck...thanks fox and paul ws anderson for making a pg-13 piece of crap...and how does one alien kill two predators like it was nothing?? you would think two great franchises like alien and predator would at least get a decent director...and what was with that slow mow matrix like facehugger scene...???and was it me or did the predators look kinda fat and bloated? but the worst thing was when the predator took his mask off in front of the girl and he had this smile on his face! stan winston must have vomited...what did they do to the predators face? and did you notice when the queen came out of the ice the predator had this \\"oh crap!\\" look on his face...can anyone tell me how predator which was made 18 years ago looks so superior to this???"},{"rating":"1","title":"AVP is very disappointing","review":"When I saw the AVP film in the movies, i thought it was lacking.

This is a terrible film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Your kidding me","review":"I cant belive i listened to some Newspaper Reporters when they said Movie of the year. And i listened. I love movies where there is a monster and everyone is trapped trying to survive. Of course everyone dies but the main character, who didnt see that coming a mile away. Well it starts out these group of people saw a Pyrimid in Antarctica and they invistagation. It ends up there in a middle of a war between Preator and Alien.

I was thinking of classic aliens fighting the predator all while a bunch of colonial marines(the marines in aliens) where in the middle of the conflict..what turned out was this. Bascily a ripley wannabe is cought up in a war between the aliens and predators in a predator training temple. Which leads to alot of deaths from side characters and a pretty sad plot. In the end the predator teams up with the woman and they kill the queen together..this I think was one of the key things that destroyed this movie...what where they thinking of...Also..one alien manages to kill 2 predators by itself which is completely sad..It was just a run of the mill one, nothing special about em..If your a aliens or predator fan do not waste your money on this weither your buying it or renting this...they should be handing it out and paying you...its that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Junk.....Exactly what it's supposed to be.","review":"Yes, the 13 year olds(and anyone older)who say this movie is \\"totally awesome\\" need to be beaten.

If you do not understand this, you need to get a life. Granted the originals are classics of the genre but come on, what do you expect from a movie that is rehashing material for the 5th time.(By the way, all of you who just thought to yourself \\"This movie isn't a rehash...it has both Aliens AND Predators\\" your Morons)Second, even though the movie is a piece of crap, you can still enjoy it for the piece of crap that it is.

A 'proud' tradition spanning decades.This latest offering can be summed up in one word really - pathetic. A sorry shameful affair, without a single redeeming quality. A disjointed, uninteresting and directionless plot, unlikeable and uninteresting characters (poorly played to boot), and little of note in the visual department.The first two Alien films were rather interesting - to think that it has come to this...I really don't even feel like writing more.

I went into this film not expecting it to be as good as Alien or Aliens, As a matter of fact I wasnt expecting much at all.

When you hear hard nosed Sci-Fi or Horror fans complaining that they didnt like this film, dont believe them. I gaurantee that they will pick this up on DVD the day it hits the racks.

Links to the previous films are extremely tenuous, and generally very lazy (in earlier films incubation of the alien inside humans took a day or two, here it only takes 5 minutes). This film should have been so much darker, more brutal, in line with the comic books.

There were a few cool action moments but it was less like what these monsters usually do and more like a wrestling match. The worst part of the whole movie was the corny human/predator team up (it was painful to watch)<br />The movie was by the numbers for a sci-fi movie targeted for the 12 year old (No offence 13 year olds but my requirements for movies at 13 weren't that high).<br />Rent this one if you must see it.<br />"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK but wheres the Marines???","review":"I kept thinking it would be like Predator, or Aliens where the military would do some thing about it, to stop the aliens from spreading, but aside from like 3 people with guns, this movie is almost a pacifist compared to its LEGENDARY ancestors.

Yes, the film had a few good spots, but the keyword there is \\"few\\".

Of course, the plot stinks, the dialogue is hokey and the situation is just plain stupid. That's what Grade B is all about. What's important are the monsters and the action.

(They may as well have given her and the Alien a love scene to put the nail in the coffin)There was too much charactor development to just off everybody suddenly and focus on the warriors from another world.

This is just another vastly overrated mess(This movie has to be the the most overrated movie since Resident Evil 1 and 2). Please Paul W.S. Anderson stop making movies of any genre because your the worst director ever, even Edward D.Wood could make a better movie than you can you poser. This movie is only recommended for brainless teens and science fiction nerds who like movies like Star Wars and Star Trek.

Anderson ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only I could give it a ZERO","review":"This movie is absolutely terrible. It does both franchises a complete disservice.

Other than that the movies was spectacular, strange but still a good movie regardless.

For surely it would be better to have just one set of genocidal bad guys roaming the antarctic wastes, and not two.As they're slugging away at each other *we* just don't care a jot who wins.

So where is the unrated version????"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just to let you know","review":"I just wanted to share this with customers.

I hope this helps some users."},{"rating":"1","title":"One word says it all","review":"The word \\"Versus\\" in the title should tell you all you need to know about this movie. It has no character development. It has no plot complexity. It doesn't even maintain consistency with past movies of the respective series.A glaring flaw from the historical perspective: a pyramid built by an culture ancestor to ones we know of would not be a patchwork of their styles. If such a culture existed, we could recognize it by characteristics that developed (or deteriorated) in the others.The humans are cookie-cutter action flick characters. The only real effort to help the viewer identify with them is when one shows pictures of his kids. My, what stunning originality.If you like seeing vicious creatures tear people and each other apart, you might find this enjoyable. Other than that, this has all the sophistication of the Jerry Springer show."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVP SUCKS!!!","review":"Please by any means do not go see this crappy,goreless, badly acted and extremely lame film. This film gives both the awesome \\"Alien\\" and \\"Predator\\" franchises a very bad name. It ruined what could've been a shocking and creative monster match-up. But all of those hopes went down the drain, folks! It is so poorly boring and redundant that it feels like the creators made it into such a terribly executed mistake on purpose. Shame on you for making a movie with spectacular potential such an uninspired piece of tired and repetitive garbage like AVP. This is pure cinema trash at its finest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"This movie was absolute trash and shames the whole Alien and Predator series. Good special effects (thanks to large budget) but rest of movie (acting, story, etc,) way too corny and bad. I'm just relieved I didn't pay to see it (thank you Predator special edition DVD). Do yourself a favor and watch any of the other Predator and Alien movies (even the awful Alien Resurrection)you will be 10 times more entertained than watching this crud.BTW they ruined the predator's whole image by making it \\"friendly\\". What the hell! The predator slaughters every human it comes into contact with and then suddenly is friends with the remaining human survivor. What a joke, just like this entire movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"AvP sucks!","review":"Paul W.S. Anderson is a crappy director, almost as crappy as Michael Bay. This movie should've been categorized as a comedy because I was laughing throughout the entire thing. There were tons of cheesy lines, not to mention the chick in the movie outlives the predators. This is one of those movies where you're laughing that it's so bad, so if that's what you're looking for then go see it. I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome speical effects","review":"The movie is PG-13 so that pretty much tells you what you wont see. The speical effects are really good but as I said, PG-13 really hurts the movie. I see they have an unrated version but I wont buy it. I did notice that they have an extended version. I thought it was cool until I realize it didnt have more violence, just swearing. Cool effects with a few scenes that are really good but overall, disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome action, dull,confusing & ridiculous storyline","review":"Many people might get offended if i give this movie 4 stars( SPARE ME !!!! Some have also given it 5 star). ONe major point everyone agrees that the story is distorted and twisted, even the entire history of human race has to be rewritten to fit this story.The backdrop of this story looks as if a 10 year old has written this screenplay out of his childish imagination.Even the storyline in the movie is pretty weak . All human characters die except one and humans are not at all involved in any fight sequences( They are just mute spectators). I had the feeling that its story could have been better.Although acknowledging all this,This is a great action movie.The action stills,the breathtaking images,the larger than life fight sequences all add to the eeriness of the movie.IF you will see this movie in a theatre you will definitely be blown by it.All in all,an excellent fun and entertaining movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"um...well not so good","review":"With a plot that makes absolutly no sense if you've seen any of the alien or predator movies and a bunch of faux scares with decent effects but no real gore (which is what you look for in one of these films) AvP falls short, very very short of what it could have been. The acting is what it could be which is not very good and the alien on predator battles and or fights are really dissapointing. This is no war. It's one predator and a human girl fighting a bunch of aliens. False advertising is what I call that. A waste of time and money, not just for the consumer but for 20th centery fox as well...really bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Human Element","review":"ALIEN VS. PREDATOR has an interesting idea and some cool special effects...but they shouldn't have been so quick to kill off all the human characters. The scruffy space crew of ALIEN and the steroid mercs of PREDATOR helped make those films the classics that they are.First blown opportunity: when the commando tumbles down the ice shaft, he lands covered in ice and snow--reminding me of Arnold covered in mud in the first PREDATOR and concealing him. So why couldn't the commando have survived to keep some human element in the story? Why couldn't the Predators have missed him like they did Arnold?Instead, the people are dispatched with little imagination. And the movie suffers. Or, I guess I should say, the audience suffers."},{"rating":"2","title":"AVP","review":"Why buy new ..The DVD was just like new no scratches, played like new one..movie and sound ismuch better in bluray then regular DVD"},{"rating":"1","title":"The biggest problem with this movie is it's too dark most of the time","review":"The biggest problem with this movie is it's too dark most of the time. I can hardly see things clearly. That makes it's very difficult for me to enjoy it. There are a lot of fighting and bloody scenes but there's no suspense at all. The first installment of Predator and the second of Aliens are much more engaging and suspenseful.It's worth renting for curiosity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do these guys ever actually watch the originals?","review":"Between this movie and Resurrection I've pretty much given up on the idea that directors now could achieve continuity and/or quality in a story continuation. The first 3 succeeded because of a style. The stories were about the struggle and unity of the few survivors, not about how cool it looks to see someone killed. This movie (like all of Paul W.S. Andersons) could have easily been written and directed by a grade schooler.He cares more about facehugger bullet-time shots than actual suspense, a point that is made even more apparent if you watch any of his Resident Evil movies. And if you swing an alien around and smash it into a stone collumn I really doubt it will just plow through the collumn with very little physical damage.[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Music, Cool Predator, Great Set","review":"That says it all for me. I liked that the people had to side with one or the other and some of the action and the design was really great but when i was finished watching i deffinitly didn't need to see it again. I have seen Alien at least ten times and Predator at least four. But put them together and it's almost a bore."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a pity!","review":"I hope people don't start to think of this movie as Alien 5. In my mind this is a whole new venture, one that is separate from any of the work that Sigourney Weaver did on the first four Alien films. The first 4 films are pretty good and I really like the whole series. It works rather well and I would love to see another Alien film with Sigourney in it. I think they could pull off one more film. Ripley's a great hero.This movie was pretty bad. The only reason I give it 2 stars is because of the special effects. I felt like I was watching a Scooby Doo version of Alien. Whoever greenlit this film clearly just wanted to make money. The plot was..well..stupid and the atmosphere of the movie was pretty much non-existent. Each of the first four Alien movies were provocative in some sense no doubt because of Sigourney's involvement. This one was as boring as a white wall and it was as cheesy as a funhouse at a state fair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse Then Garbage","review":"Whe I first heard Alien Vs. Predator was happening I was excitied, I went to see I fell a sleep after the first 40 minutes. I rented it once and almost took it back three minutes after I finished it. This was the awful!!, Their is alien gore which sucks that's it, no good actors, I can't even name one that starred in that movie, the looks and effects were sh*t. The ending had to be the worst of all that. I'm just glad I didn't buy cuz if I had that movie would be burning in the fireplace right now. They had to take good movies and fu*k them up with this sh*t. Worst of all they gave this movie a PG-13 so all the good things about a horror movie were gone.

Jason that movie at least kept me intertained."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put this on a list with Freddy vs. Jason","review":"This, like many other action movies will go down in history as being outrageous, severely unnecessary and full of bombastic and extraordinarily unrealistic special effects. When will Hollywood and, more importantly, people who pay to watch this stuff realize that movies like this can never in a million years be good? Just the basic idea of this movie is horrendous. If there was a trash can for ideas, movie premises like this should be in it. The trash can would have to be enormous, though, what with all the garbage that Hollywood throws our way (just take a look at any movie with Arnold in it), but at least Hollywood could save us all a little time and stop pretending like they still have an original idea left in the vacuums that are their heads.Joe Pesci"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mangled Menaces","review":"I really am not at all very impressed with too many movies these days, because there really isn't anything all that exciting right now. Anyway, th latest Alien Vs. Predator, isn't all as impressive beyond the original Alien film. Although Sanna Lathan has done some spectaular performances in A Raisin In The Sun, and in Dissaperaing Acts with Westley Snipes for HBO, this film is just a first class bomb. I really wasn't very impressed with the story and the detail of this movie. It just really seemed like the same thing a lifetime ago. All in all, for die hard Sci-Fi fanatics, it is a good film.

From the cheesy plot, predictable story and average to undestinct acting the most this movie has to offer is a good laugh.The start is basic of an action movie and you might be a little intrigued but as the aliens start showing up and then the predators any suspence or interest is gone. This isn't an action its a comedy, half the time the alien and predator don't look like their going to fight; they look like their gonna kiss!

It was cheesy, over dramatic, the score for it set absolutely no mood for it, the screenwriting was mediocre.

Apparently the answer to that question is one very bad movie. The movie's over emphasis of the acidity of the aliens' blood was beyond annoying. The movie was tolerable until about 45 minutes into it when the plot took a turn for the worst. Honestly, I don't think that fans of either series were really looking forward to seeing the predators befriend any humans. Also, the scene at the end was strangely reminiscent of a Jurassic Park movie, I could just as easily have pictured a T-rex chasing the woman through a field of bones. If you're not a fan of either of the movie franchises, this movie could potentially pass as decent, for anyone else I would avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filmed in Total Darkness","review":"I actually liked this movie, too bad it was so dark inside the pyramid that I could not see much of the action. Throughout the whole movie I kept wishing that the expedition crew would have larger flashlights or maybe the sophisticated predators installed a lightswitch somewhere!! you can tell millions were spent on the elaborate maze of tunnels and walls in the pyramid, but we can barely see them ! The only light during the filming of the action came from their tiny flashlights or the constant lighting of flairs. I hope the sequel will be filmed outdoors instead of caves and pyramids. I do love the predator costume/armor/latex makeup. I won't give away the ending, but you can tell it opens the door for a sequel. The final 2 scenes are outdoors so you can actually see the action."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"Too bad the lowest I can rate it is a 1 star.

It's more like extended scenes, and there's only a couple. The commentaries aren't horrible, but they're only available on the theatrical version.So really what you get here is 2 versions of the theatrical release.

The action is in the UNRATED EDITION. The version which makes sense is the UNRATED EDITION. The PG-13 edition is the chopped up, convoluted crapfest we saw at the theaters.Thanks to the studio for letting Anderson have this UNRATED EDITION.

He also shows great sensibility in a lot of tracks. And one thing for sure: there\`s no studio tricks. Is all Jason\`s magic.

The sound quality of this record is poor, the rock chops on it don't have any commercial value whatsoever, hence the reason why they were never released in the first place. The compilation of tracks is dire and after just one listen has ended up collecting dust in my CD cabinet. Be realistic, we have already heard the best of Jason Becker, and now all that we hear is the release of old guitar licks from tape in a desperate attempt to keep the bank roll going. To say this CD is a master piece is a joke."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great guitar album","review":"I don't understand where some of these reviews are coming from. Jason Becker was one of the best guitarists of his genre and to get a place in Roth's bands rests my case. I think it is great to hear out-takes from the studio of Jason's experiminetal edge. There are some great tracks on this record and what makes them different is that they have not been released for commercial venture. Jason Becker was a trus artist of his time and in the upsurge of space guitaring in the Eighties he out played many around. I only hope for him and his family that one day they find a cure for this desease that ruined his life, because what happened to Jason at the turning point of an awesome career just wasn't fair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring stories and good basic business advice","review":"Martha Stewart has built a business empire and love her or hate her, her success is undeniable. In this book, Martha uses inspiring stories (some old, some new) to illustrate her ten essential business tips.Passion, great customer service, frugality and more are all valuable tips for business owners, and Martha has a huge audience to market this information to. I think she's right on track - home business and small business is still growing and many people need inspiration and basic \\"how-to\\" advice.This book is not targeted to the business school graduate, but to Martha's audience - ordinary, average women in various walks of life looking to do better, whether that means making a perfect souffle or turning her own \\"Big Idea\\" into millions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Direct and to the point","review":"A very direct and to the point as Martha always does.

It's inspiring for those who have ever dreamed of owning their own business or starting something new. The thing that surprised me the most was that I could see myself in her writing, and I could picture myself in a lot of the scenarios Martha chose. I've always been a fan of Martha, but found her in the past to be very woman-oriented and a lot of her shows/books to be primarily for women. This book is unique in that it is for everyone... male and female, young and old alike. If you want to be the best you can be, want to dream about new beginnings and want the inspiration and clues about where to begin, this is a perfect book for you. I couldn't put the book down after I started reading it. Martha's knowledge and ideas have been put to great use here."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's okay","review":"Didn't really get much out of it.

The only part left out was watch out for the Feds.This book is a definite look into a company founded on ideas, and the packaging of ideas. Forget about exectution and learning much about execution. As Martha explained they leave all those details up to their partners. After reading the rules, I think Martha left out the biggest rule of all - constantly hawk your products like you are P.T.

I found the interviews in this book with individuals diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome interesting, which is why I gave it two stars. However, the book is ultimately infuriating because I can't figure out what the author's ultimate point about Asperger's is. He seems to say: (1) this is a real disorder; (2) it is a neurological disorder; (3) these people are really just harmless eccentrics; (3) the disorder exists partly, and maybe primarily, because of American notions of what is and isn't normal. Interestingly, those he interviews or discusses who fit closest to his view of harmless eccentrics who should be left alone, such as pianist Glenn Gould, are those with either remarkable and marketable talents or independent incomes.

I really did. I normally love post-apocalypse-type stories, and this one looked like a winner. Now, to be fair, the writing was not too bad, and the characters seemed well-drawn.Let me tell you why I got 150 pages in and then threw it down in disgust: The insane overabundance of ellipses. You know, when you see three periods strung together... Once in a while, such a device can add tension, etc. etc. But when you use them (and I'm not joking here) every third or fourth sentence, it quite rudely interrupts the flow of the story. But wait! It gets worse! There were several dozen instances where the author and/or editor apparently felt that just one ellipses wouldn't do. So instead there are two or three strung together, both on the end AND beginning of sentences. ......Kind of like this......Annoying, and ultimately unreadable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I love post-apocalyptic books but this one fell short of being the least entertaining.

This falls into the latter category.Females are always portrayed in this book as needing a male - the mothers have their son do all the work AND have him steel for him. The kindergarten aged girl in the book is obsessed with having a boyfriend and settles on a thief (who's a forth grader). The females are clingy, whiny, and useless.The males aren't any better. They do whatever they are told, coddle the females, and all but one don't seem to have any moral backbone. The one teenager who says that steeling is wrong is portrayed as a food obsessed bizarre person.The artwork seems very juvenile to me. It's not even close to the beauty in XXXholic. It's the kind of artwork I'd expect from a late seventies animae (think Voltron).All in all I'd skip these books and go for something with more plot and more depth like Angelic Layer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasently Surprised!!!","review":"I just got this toy in the mail(early x-mas present for my son) and was very pleased.

Bart's arms swing around as if he were really balancing on the skateboard. Normal batteries power it for an acceptable amount of time. And it just looks funny!The only problem I have with it is that it doesn't work very well on hardwood floors. I was hoping to be able to run it around the house during commercial breaks, but the wheels don't get very good traction and steering doesn't work very well. Because it's designed to do a wheelie easily, not enough weight rests on the front wheels and they get very little grip. The throttle is either off or full blast so you can't slowly ease it into a turn. And unfortunatley once a little wax gets on the wheels (after about 1 minute), he no longer can pull off the wheelie.

For those young enough who didn't hear her in her prime, let me tell you that no other mezzo even compares, not Bartoli, not Von Stade, simply no one except Conchita Supervia, but she died in the 30's. Everything else is sensational in this recording, including of course the magisterial conducting of the then very young Claudio Abbado. The Bartoli/Chailly recording is very good, but this one is so much better.

The focus is on the human relationships within the family, magnificently and movingly described; but the novel's edge comes from the constant intrusion of grim outside reality, the tormented history of Poland between the Congress of Vienna in 1815 and the second-world-war Nazi storming of the Warsaw Ghetto. Counterpoint between inner and outer reality, between public and private life, between flesh and spirit, makes this book not just another family saga but a statement about Jewish (and non-Jewish) humanity at large. In that, \\"The Family Muskat\\" is characteristic of Singer's work - it is his universality, not his particularity, which makes him one of the most respected writers in modern times."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his best","review":"Back in the 70s I read whatever was available by Singer. This was one of the first, and my favorite. I love long, involved stories with lots of characters. I don't remember much about any of his stories because it's been over 20 years since I read them, but I remember my impressions. I prefer all his stories that take place in Poland over those that are set in US. The textures are different. I found the North American based tales to be somewhat interesting, but the characters were less appealing. I think his feel for the European context was stronger in him, and was conveyed with more warmth than the American contexts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jarman meets the Smiths","review":"I have this collection of Smiths' videos on videotape, so I can't comment on the DVD aspects, but I cansay whether or not I think it's worth getting this.

Crystal picture, with uncompressed linear PCM audio for the ultimate in sound clarity. Spartan custom-made menus. No bonus stuff. And the back cover says running time appx. 50 minutes.

That's why I rented this video, to see if maybe I was missing something. Maybe that lack of a pre-existing interest in the band disqualifies this review, I don't know. Anyway, I found both the music and the videos to be nausiatingly and insufferably narcissistic. The music seems to have very little structure, no real melodies. Just Morissey warbling in his ultra-fey, upper class manner. Add to this the fact that Morissey is as ugly as a boot, and the videos are very hard to watch. I suppose if you're already a Smiths fan, then these videos will satisfy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bollocks really","review":"As a long time Smiths fan I was hugely disappointed by this. I actually quite like the TOTP footage, but where is their \\"William it was really nothing\\" appearance, which was one of their best? Where are the actual live performances from the Whistle Test and the Tube which were just great? Of course, the Jarman mini-movies are here which is great if you like Derek Jarman. Frankly, this collection's pretty much bollocks and a waste of money. Nice to see the shrubbery again though."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice dvd","review":"Most of the videos consist of Smiths' appearances on the UK series \\"Top of the Pops\\".

I am happy with this collection of videos, except i wish they had of included the other video for \\"the boy with the thorn in his side\\", as an alternate take. The video i've seen for that song, on mtv.com, starts off with a shot of a soundboard then goes to the band in a room. That is the only thing that disappointed me about the collection. Yes, as many of you have said in your reviews, it is cheesy, but that was the 80's(remember the flock of seagulls video? yikes)I love the smiths and only wish i had been a little older in the 80's to have experienced what it was like when they first came onto the music scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it for the price...","review":"If you are a Smith's fan, this is an excellent collection. It's essentially the VHS tape in DVD form, so no bangs or whistles. But it is easier to jump to various tracks.

(Most notable is \\"The Queen is Dead\\".)And if you are not a Morrissey or Smiths fan, you WILL hate it. Period. Keep that in mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and educational","review":"Yes, the videos are kind of corny, but this DVD is a real treat for those of us who were still learning how to walk when The Smiths were at the apex of their career. I liked how the DVD combined Smiths videos with some live preformances letting veiwers who maybe be new to The Smiths see them play. The sound quality is excellent reguardless of the shorthandedness of some of the videos. The only knocks I have against \\"The complete picture\\" is the length (50 minutes) and the \\"The queen is dead\\" flim at the end.

Standouts are Walk Away Renee, Who'll Stop the Rain, and Baby, It's You. The Roches are just beautiful in the background of Walk Away Renee and White Bird - too bad they're only on three tracks. Buy this fabulous work and reminisce about a better time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets better with age","review":"When I first got this disc I thought, \\"Its not as good as Dog Days\\", and I sort of pushed it to the back of my collection. Well after pulling it out again and giving it a fair amount of playing time, I discovered how much I like this Disc. Still may not be quite as good as Dog Days, but it has a more of a varity of sounds and songs than Dog Days. This is just simply a talented band, and given the chance, if you are a country rock fan, these guys will win you over. Think Neil Young, Skynyrd, Jayhawks, and Son Volt, and Blue Mountain is in that catagory. Fine company indeed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets better each listen","review":"I have owned this CD for several months, and after listening to it several times I have decided to share some thoughts with you. Initially I listened to it, and after a few spins placed it in my CD rack. Its OK I thought, but not near as good as Dog Days.Recently brought it back out, had to take a 4 hour trip to Nashville. I listened to it full length twice, once getting there and once on the return. Blue Mountain reminds me of CCR sometimes, and other times Neil Young and Crazy Horse. But they are their own, Cary Hudson is the core here. This one is bottom line oustanding. Get it. The music is basic, but filled with images of American life. Wife Laurie provides some great harmony on the opening track, but each one of these tracks are interesting and full of soul, life and music. Some tracks sound similair, but they differ in approach and texture. This CD is worth the price of several. Enjoy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks!","review":"This one of the worst Blue Mountain cd's yet!, they sound nothing like \\"dog days' or \\"home grown\\", everything is different, if the remainder cd's are like this, I'm glad they no longer are together, glad I got it used, not so much money totally wasted!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Torn Away\\" and the Irish conflict!","review":"We had to read the novel in our English class. We discussed the conflict of Ireland and its history. The novel is easy to understand even for Germans. From my point of view the story doesn\`t deal enough with the recent problem. But it\`s a good book for children in the age of 13 to 15, because of the nice content. It\`s easy to identify with the characters and the main character's situation. But for dealing with the Irish conflict the book is useless. Sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"For any of you who've read Shades of Gray, it's similar to that book. Declan is someone that is easy for kids to relate to. He's so full of hatred, and he doesn't know what to do with it. Naturally, he turned it toward the source. Unexpected twists hold your attention. The end is predictable, but over all it's a good story line. It's easy to read, but I recommend it for 13 and up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic but nice to read","review":"I read the book, because we had to read it in school.First the title meant nothing to me.After the first chapters, I thought that it will be a boring book. But later on, I enjoyed reading it more and more.I think it's easy to identify with Declan and other protagonists of this book. It's a story which is explained realistically with real problems of the modern life.I liked the contrast of the two \\"worlds\\", on the one hand, the world full of violence and hate, and on the other hand the peaceful and friendly world.It was nice to work with this book, because there were so many possibilities!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Skin Care","review":"This product was reccomended by my barber and after trying the sample I decided to by more of this product because it works"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay but not necessary","review":"I'd heard great thing from my waxer about this product, but wasn't terribly impressed.

The action is gripping, fast and frequent (okay, even well written at times); however, it isn't enough to offset wooden characters and dialogue. The history and facts seem accurate and real; but the story is mind-candy. One is reminded of a TV-movie like \\"War and Remembrance\\" in which the character's superficial romances and personal tragedies serve as a rest stop between \\"Important Events.\\" I nominate Chuck Norris for the TV-movie version of this book and series. A \\"4\\" for historical accuracy and above average action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Add one to the winner column","review":"I have been reading Bernard Cornwell's books one after the other for the last two years .

He is a very good writer with a wonderful grasp of the details of history .

There are few pictures of Ground Zero, which I thought was good. It's nice the author focused on the people and staion houses that make up FDNY, instead of the usual 9/11 books with pictures of the debris field at the Trade Center. Across the bottom of every page are the names of those who gave their lives in a valiant effort to save others. Photos of the shrines created in front of the fire houses serve to uplift rather than cause sadness. Instead of being depressing and dreary, this book drew out the pride I feel to be one of the members of this family-- the fire service. The books tell the story of not only the FDNY, but the city they protect and serve every day... and the pride those citizens feel in their fire department.

I tried to find out if this book was explicit before I bought it and could not find any warnings on it that way. The story did seem engaging but I did not want that kind of detail. Love Inspired books are written for the Christian Booksellers Market and if you check the Harlequin site, they have a very detailed description of what can and cannot go into Love Inspired books.

I LOVE his (Tim Baker's) voice. If nothing else, it's distinctive. You'll KNOW without question who is singing as it's very unique.I got this album when it first came out (on vinyl) and I still listen to it (along with their other 4 albums, Metalblade just came out with a new CD not to long ago) on a regular basis. I think they really picked up the pace on King Of The Dead and One Foot In Hell, but Frost And Fire is STILL classic metal.Standout tracks (to me) are I'm Alive, Frost And Fire, and Edge Of A Knife. Maybe That's Why is a interesting instrumental. If you like classic heavy metal, give it a listen. You could do a lot worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rocks!","review":"Cirith Ungol is one of the greatest bands that never really made it in the Hard Rock / Metal scene. This is their first album and in my opinion their best. The music has a distinctly unique sound that relies equally on all of the instruments. Great guitar, bass, and drums.

Tina Brooks fell prey to addiction just as he was coming into his prime, leaving us with a glimpse of what might have been. Brooks' tone on tenor is somewhere between Lester Young and Hank Mobley, with a hint of Charlie Parker. His performance is solid and he interacts well with his impressive collection of sidemen. Art Blakey's drums and Doug Watkins' bass propel Brooks' tenor, Sonny Clark's piano, and Lee Morgan's brash bright trumpet through two Brooks originals and a trio of standards. This is a solid and very enjoyable set of straight ahead hard bop in the Blue Note mold, and makes on wonder what might have been had Brooks' lived longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget the Bops","review":"Now were talking! 28 songs of wall Bashing Rock'N Roll.

It is a weird choice, since the only other books I know of that do that are Bibles with the words of Christ highlighted in red letters. The color is hard to read.

It was written by an Australian, and so everything is slightly skewed toward the Australian involvement, which seems unimportant in the grand scheme of things if you ask me. I loved the movie The Dish about the Australian tracking station, but I can't seem to stir up any more interest in the subject.

I did a taste test between this and 5 other cocoa powders by using a blend of cocoa powder, sugar, and water. The Cacao Barry won hands down, even beating out the Valrhona I had purchased at the same time. I made cupcakes with the Cacao Barry and they were much better than the ones with my other cocoa powders with the exception of the Valrhona. When I made my chocolate buttercream frosting using the Cacao Barry, it was so good it literally brought tears to my eyes, especially paired with the devil's food cupcakes.I would highly recommend this cocoa powder, although the Valrhona cocoa powder made a better cupcake, this is a better all-around cocoa powder in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummed.","review":"I'm not impressed by this cocoa powder, wish I could return it because I don't intend to use it. It's got an off vegetable scent, like the cheaper cocoas, not rich and warming and chocolatey. Out of the package, it has a back note scent of dishwater, it's the only reference I can make, sorry! I've tried ghiradelli, and this is similar to the cheap taste of it. I'm sticking with vahlrona. I baked a cake with this powder, and it had very little flavor, just bitter with a slight scent of chocolate. I gave it two stars, because it is better than Hershey's, ghiradelli, and the other supermarket brands, but, still, why waste time baking and cooking with it if it's going to taste only slightly different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film","review":"I found this movie because it was Dove Family Approved and the film was made by a young husband and wife in Texas for their honeymoon. I have to say this film was really something special for first time filmmakers. While most first timers are trying to shock you, throw in drugs and alcohol problems, try crazy tactics or just overall try too hard to make you pay attention to them...the filmmakers that made Under the Western Sun are doing something completely different and are trying to make a film that anyone can watch. This movie is perfect for families, but it's also perfect for anyone else wanting to watch a solid fun film."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like it.","review":"This is the only time I've read a book that was later made into a movie, and came away certain that the movie was better.I get that William Peter Blatty enjoys exploring the connection between madness and evil, and pondering its origins, but if you're coming to this already familiar with The Exorcist (which I'm assuming most people are), it's going to feel redundant more than anything else. And well it should, seeing as almost half a page is reused verbatim in The Exorcist."},{"rating":"2","title":"detective story","review":"I love the way Lisa Garndner writes and her stories, this book was no exception. It is a very fast paced story and a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twists, Turns and Surprises","review":"The author manages to weave a tail surrounding our heroine while unravelling a murder. The characters take on personalities that draw you into their lives, hoping beyond hope that you really \\"don't know who the killer is\\".This is a novel that, while dealing with current - to date issues also delves deep into the past allowing us a full dimensional portrait of the main characters.This is the first book that I have read by this particular author; I now have her ear-marked for notification of new releases. I think this one may be one to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartwrenching","review":"Lisa Gardner is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors. The problem is she doesn't write quickly enough. I am already waiting for her follow-up to this novel.Rainie Conner is a police officer leading her first homicide, a school shooting, where the shooter is the police chief's 13 year old son. Rainie doesn't suspect everything is as it appears to be, and with the help of FBI agent Pierce Quincy, they try to find the truth about the shooting that leaves 3 dead and a town torn apart.I did not want to put this book down. I made myself read it only at work on break as not to devour it in one sitting. The teaser chapter for her next novel which involves Quincy's daughter is very enticing and I can't wait for it to come out. Buy this book, you won't be disappointed :)Thanks for reading :)**Pandora"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dependable Lisa Gardner","review":"I've read several books by Lisa Gardner and although there are some occasional plot flaws, she never fails to deliver a good story. When the villain was finally revealed, I was pretty surprised as I had not been thinking in that direction. The cross country diversion reminded me of another Lisa Gardner book, \\"The Next Accident\\" featuring the same characters. That duplicate scenario was kind of unsatisfying. While it is true that much of the book dealt with reflecting on past trangressions of the characters, there was plenty of action and investigation to keep things moving. In conclusion, 'The Third Victim' is interesting reading and worth a look. Lisa Gardner delivers again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This is the the 5th or 6th book of Gardner's I read - most of the D.D. Warren series and \\"The Perfect Husband\\". I thoroughly enjoyed all of them, especially \\"The Perfect Husband\\" and couldn't wait to get this book, the next in the FBI Profiler series. What a disappointment. I had to force myself to finish it. There was way too much indepth info on why and how a kid becomes a school shooter and it was repeated over and over - different wording, different chapter - boring after the first time.Also, as much as I tried I didn't find Rainie, one of the main characters, likeble or believeable. Of course even with all the time spent on her and her history I didn't have a feel for who she is by the end.I haven't given up on Gardner but I'll read my Kindle sample and the reviews a little better before paying $7.99 for another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Facing Rainie's past ...","review":"I have come to appreciate the novels including Rainie Conner as a major character, and appreciate how this particular novel incorporates the secrets of her past as a part of both the solution to the current crime and in her ongoing friendship with FBI profiler Pierce Quincy. They make a good pair in creating a story.As with all Lisa Gardner novels (in my opinion), the characters are well drawn, the story is interesting, the solutions logical, and best of all the journey is filled with major twists and turns, and an intensity that keeps you from wanting to put it down.A very good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Third Victim","review":"I stumbled upon this author and this book at the dollar rack at the discount book store and finished it in an afternoon.Great characters and writing style, I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.

Primarily, I did not think that the book ever got to the point, but was constantly being side-tracked by romance, the female detective's family history, the family history of Danny, etc. Also, I felt that the principle characters were left hanging, with no real conclusion being drawn as to what happens to them. I purchased this book on audio disc, and it did not live up to my expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a stretch.........","review":"The Third VictimThe story starts out interestingly enough and then it all falls apart as the plot unfolds. The Sheriff's son is involved in multiple murders at his school. The Sheriff is actively interfering with the investigation. The lead investigating officer is Rainey Conner. She works under the Sheriff. Conner has a long personal friendship with the Sheriff and enough personal baggage that normally would prevent her from ever being a cop in the first place. Holy comflict of interest Batman! State and Federal agents are called in but who is in charge, the admittedly unqualified, conflicted, unstable, Rainey Conner! Oh Please!!! If you removed the unqualified cop, had a realistic chain of command with the investigators,and put the Sheriff in jail for interfering this might be a good read.My suspension of disbelief button was pushed too many times on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Good...","review":"I didn't like this book for several reasons. The school shooting theme is very disturbing to me and I honestly don't think that the author did a good job exploring or explaining that issue. Another reason I didn't like the book was because the Rainie character was severely irritating. I'm so sick of the \\"macho\\" woman in these suspense thrillers. Rainie needs to grow up and get over herself. Lastly, the villain in this book didn't make any sense. His motives and reasoning were stupid. This book had potential, but fell flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here we go again.","review":"An interesting start goes downhill very quickly. The female cop is of course ATTRACTIVE, single, fit as a fiddle and has the HORRIFIC MURDER OF HER MOTHER constantly on her mind. All main character cops in books these days have brutal memories of murdered members of their families. The murderer is also gives us his/her thoughts and SINGLES OUT THE ATTRACTIVE COP AS A FUTURE VICTIM. Cops and detectives are the prime intended victims of serial killers in today's mystery stories. Of course ATTRACTIVE FEMALE COPS ALWAYS MEET HUNKY, LEAN AND BEAUTIFULLY MUSCLED FBI, DETECTIVE, SPECIAL AGENT, or something, with his own HORRIFIC FAMILY DISASTER and FIGHTING/ROMANCE ENSUES. This plot is so shopworn, overused and boring that reading it becomes a chore....wait a minute, the chore is over...I'm a third of the way through and have stopped reading this book. This is the second book I've tried by this author and both have been graded D.

I've read Both of Ms. Gardners other books and enjoyed them but this one wasn't great.The suspense part was just ok, wondering who-done-it and especially why. Even the \\"why\\" part was a bit shaky. But the \\"romance\\" element was basically non-existant and pretty lame. Not the greatest ending I've ever read either (won't say more and ruin it for you). Better luck next time Ms. Gardner."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Get It","review":"How did the watcher know Rainie's secrets? Didn't anybody ever wonder what happened to the guy who killed her mother--he had a wife and child. Was he a local man? What did Rainie do with his body when she moved it? How did a man as young as Richard Mann supposedly know so much about what Rainie did? It seemed as if he knew what \\"really happened\\", then somebody says that he thought she killed her mother and was disappointed that she didn't. This book didn't make a whole lot of sense. Halfway through it I remembered I had read The Other Daughter, and I didn't like that one either."},{"rating":"2","title":"bought as gift","review":"I honestly do not know if this book is good or not or even what it's about since I bought it as a gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Author","review":"A horrific school shooting brings us the best and the worst in the sleepy little town.

This book is a hard to put down thriller. I enjoyed the narrative and thought that all the characters were well developed. Gardner moves her characters at a good pace and there is not alot of \\"useless chatter\\".All of her characters are flawed in some way and this makes them even more interesting.The story itself is quite intense and frankly, I didn't figure out the ending until the author chose to tell me.Very good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you value your finger nails, don't read this book!!","review":"I had never read Lisa Gardner before, so I had no idea what to expect.

Songs like Peace, Have Mercy, and Give Me A Reason reveal Third Day's heavier side, but still leave room for lighter songs like My Hope Is You and Your Love Endures. The whole album is awesome, but the last three songs, Give Me A Reason, Gomer's Theme, and Your Love Endures steal the spotlight. Each one is good in it's own way. Give Me A Reason being a solid rocker, Gomer's Theme with it's Pearl Jamish sound and cool solo at the end, and Your Love Endures, a quiet heart-felt ballad at the end. Conspiracy #5 five is a must have, only second to Time, full of Hard-edged songs, but diverse enough to allow for awesome ballads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Third Day is the bomb.","review":"this cd has a really good beat and the songs have good lyrics.

I was disappointed and now feel my expectations were much too high. This work was nothing more than an unworthy condensation of everything we've heard on \\"60 Minutes\\" or the national news every night for a number of years. No new insights, no memorable thoughts, no persuasive and careful analysis and certainly no powerful conclusions. Senator Hatch's discussion of the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings seemed nothing less than self-aggrandizing. The Senator's unnecessary tirade against a disgraced former President was unnecessary and, I think, below the station of a true Statesman.

It was written in 96 and that's generally OK. It has great basic info: history, blood groups, and a very interesting section on 'triggers for blood transfusion' that validate my belief that doctors overtransfuse.The chapter on Component therapy is a bit dated as random plts are not given in many places anymore due to the FDA requirements on bacterial testing making it almost impossible for hospitals to afford to implement, as well as the perception of safety in being exposed to fewer donors (6-12 randoms were pooled to make a unit to give to a patient).

While it is obvious that Mr. Choi posesses a vast knowledge of Maya, his skills at communicating this knowledge are severly lacking. Grammatical errors abound, and his prose is often repetitive and confusing, if not downright incomprehensible. Many of the images are utterly superfluous, and sometimes they even contradict the text. Also, on a number of occasions, the information given is just plain wrong.

As well as writing his own songs, MWS wrote (or co-wrote) some great songs for Amy Grant before she went mainstream, so these tracks are also reminiscent of her early albums (which I got to hear while working the summer of 1986 at a Christian book warehouse in London).The other song that really stands out is the worshipful Agnus Dei, which has become something of a CCM standard."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome music as always","review":"Michael W Smith always has the best music.

You are never good enough. It is better to die than to have the appearance of sin. It is no wonder that where Mormon populations are highest (Utah, Idaho, Arizona) the use of anti-depressants is three times the national average. Read this book if you want to feel bad about yourself or if you feel the need for self flagellation. I found nothing uplifting in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better that you die than survive rape","review":"This book states that it's better to die than survive a rape:\\"Also far-reaching is the effect of the loss of chastity. Once given or taken or stolen it can never be regained. Even in a forced contact such as rape or incest, the injured one is greatly outraged. If she has not cooperated and contributed to the foul deed, she is of course in a more favorable position. There is no condemnation where there is no voluntary participation. It is better to die in defending one's virtue than to live having lost it without a struggle.\\" (p.196)How much more twisted can it get?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book leads to spiritual abuse","review":"Kimball's book is all about inducing guilt in the reader. As noted in \\"The Subtle Power of Spritual Abuse\\" by Johnson & VanVonderen shaming is a type of spiritual abuse and Mormons are very good at that. All the following points as pointed out by the authors may be found in the way Mormon Leadership handle people or intimate the workings of God to people: \\"God rewards spritually with material goods\\", \\"You can never say no to those in religious authority\\", \\"The existance of trouble in your life indicates a lack of faith\\", and \\"everyone in the ministry is called by God, is appropriate, and must be trusted\\". Mormon religious leaders receive no training in counseling or psychology but yet are told that they can do it because they have been called by God. Without training it is very easy to slip into a mode of spiritual abuse. And this book does not help alleviate this but helps to foster it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderfully inspiring book.","review":"This book is beautifully written.

Jesus died on the cross for man's salvation and no amount of \\"good works\\" is going to get you anywhere. Only Jesus Christ. Man cannot become a god as it very clearly says in the Bible. Besides, the author of this book is a total Mormon nutcase, he claimed to always having conversations with the dead Joseph Smith and Brigham Young, and he even wrote about his experiences traveling in the spiritual world among Joseph Smith and other dead Mormon prophets and leaders.

In fact, it is one of the most useful tools I've seen for tearing down one's self esteem and beating one into submission to the Mormon church (and no, I don't mean humility to God, I mean submitting to the Mormon church).If you love your child, never let them read this book. If you want them to think that God doesn't love them, and that they're worthless unless they're spotless, then give them this book.I speak from experience, having read this book myself and having suffered through the mental trauma it induced. It is only since I've left the Mormon church that I can see it for what it is - the bitter ramblings of a hate-filled man who probably had some sexual deviancy of his own. Spencer W. Kimball, may you rot in the ground and may posterity forget that you ever were."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book","review":"People who read this book should be aware that it does talk about some really sensitive topics such as the problems with fornication, adultery and other nasty sins.This book is about obtaining forgiveness and the need for the atonement. Yes the author does talk about very less savory topics but only to condone them and how to recover from a life of sin and obtain the blessings of being morally clean. I am a recovering pornography addict I do not deny it.My bishop urged me to read this book to understand the blessings of the atonement. I love this book. It talks about the true reason why christ came. All the other readers are trying to bash on this book and saying things that are simply not true.

I became suicidal because of ordinary masturbation instincts because I believed in this charlatanism.The author is preoccupied with sex. Actual criminal conduct is given token mention, then the book dives into the deep end of an anti-sexual preoccupation that would make Kinsey turn over in his grave. It equates homosexuality to beastiality, and makes clear that sexual \\"sins\\" are next to murder in severity. This book is the source of the infamous lore in Mormonism that they'd rather bury a child than see them lose their purity.Thousands of mormon youth and gays have committed suicide because of sheer psychological malpractice like this.

It's not designed for quickly looking things up. However, if you are looking to an easy, painless introduction to functional programming, this is the book you want. The exercises are simple, build carefully on one another, and the theory behind them is explained at every step of the book. The presentation is charming, from the peanut butter and jelly theme throughout the examples, to the cavorting elephants on the cover. Pick this book up as a supplement to the mandatory, dry, exhaustive language reference, and work through the examples a few at a time. You'll find yourself understanding the language much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for new functional programmers","review":"This is a terrific book for opening the mind of budding functional programmers.

It is also the strangest. It covers an astonishing range of ideas, from the practical matters of Scheme syntax, to some aspects of Goedel's incompleteness results.The pedagogical style is semi-programmed. That is, learning proceeds by question and answer, almost Socratic. I found it most useful to read the chapters away from the computer. This made it necessary to think through each question.

While I tend to lean more toward physiological neuroscience perspectives on the functions of our dreams, I am very open-minded and believe that our dreams surely serve a psychological purpose as well. I picked up this book expecting something more than I got. I was presented with a poorly written and gender biased first chapter(for example, when talking of one of Cayce's clients \\"She turned to the woman's world of family and relationships...\\" Granted it was written several decades ago, but still...)

Not to mention Bjork's voice, which is beautiful but has more original character than most pop singers (not to number her with them or anything). It's has the same adventurous qualities that some other UK bands like Blur and Radiohead have taken with their newest albums. I say it's time for another British Invasion! ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bjork-The Other White Beat","review":"As a person who really likes dark, experimental, scary, depressing music, and I was just introduced to Bjork by a relative, I figured I would by Homogenic.This 10-song CD is filled with a brutal pain of heartbreak, loneliness, anger, and tragedy. Starting with the determined Hunter, to the beautiful Joga having compliments of the Iceland String Quartet, to the slow and bittersweet Unravel, to the tragic but somehow up-lifting Bachelorette, to the nice beat to All Neon Like, until you are so absorbed into the album you reach the end...through the violent climax of the CD: \\"Pluto,\\" which is just flat out cool. Then, it reaches the resolution to \\"All Is Full of Love,\\" which is one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard.This CD can only be appreciated if you're ready for it, have an open mind, listen to it several times, and I appreciate it as a whole...Homogenic is hard to pin-point, and very mysterious.It's pure genious. A sonic experiment that works...very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bjork's Best Album before Medulla!","review":"Homogenic is a very good collboaration of music from the kinda mellow sounds of Hunter to the very soothing sounds toward the end. I bought Medulla today w/ Homogenic. Homogenic is the best album that I own @ this time. I like everything from Anggun to Angie Stone, but I have never heard a better voice than Bjork. It all started when i was watching MTV cribs and somebody said that Bjork's Homogenic album is the best created. It was wierd because friends say that she is awesome too. So I buy Homogenic and find that i'm a fan as well. If anyone is having an internal battle of buying this album, I would go to your nearest big chain cd store (Best Buy, Barnes & Noble etc.) and get your copy today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bjork captivates with haunting vocals","review":"This album has proven to be a breakthrough release for the Icelandic siren. Bjork proves that her music is both intellectual and highly danceable. \\"Hunter\\" and \\"Alarm Call\\" are two of my favorite songs. Both of these titles showcase some lyrics which prove to be a bit revealing for this extremely gifted singer and song writer. I can listen to this cd over and over again while simpy reading, driving in the car, or chatting with friends. An artistic work of many moods and modulations. A very worth while purchase for just about any cd collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"One of the greatest albums ever recorded. Also a perfect introduction to Bjorks lovely music- to me all her albums are beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bjork's terrific concept album!!","review":"She does it again. This time she sticks to a single sound (no big band, no true techno) and reworks it through the whole record to create a single sonic image with many interesting and diverse bits which draw you in, drop you, and draw you in again on the next track. \\"Joga\\" and \\"Bachlorette\\" are the standout tracks on this disc. She writes all of her lyrics, and I highly admire that in the age of Mariah and Celine...she is a cutting edge artist mixing and Icelandic string quartet w/computers. Soaring ballads crash into songs with beats. Lots of beats. She is just amazing...she calls the shots, and they're wonderful!! I give it four stars instead of five because I like \\"Post\\" better, but it doesn't seem to have been as much of a challenge to Bjork...Listening to this album is like taking a walk through a very old and yet amazing modern landscape. \\"If you don't take any risks, then you don't get any treats\\" -Bjork (True dat!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bjork - musical genius for the 21st century","review":"Bjork is just wow. When you listen to her songs, you will be amazed and wonder how anybody could create such a perfect collaboration of unique, chilling vocals, intelligent, surreal, imaginative lyrics, and the most ear-pleasing blend of musical styles ever. Bjork does it with one eye closed. \\"All is Full of Love\\" is one of the most beautiful songs ever, period. Definitely check out her video collection, her visual styles are as unique and beautiful as her music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neat stuff","review":"This CD ends up in fairly heavy rotation whenever I'm doing research, writing a paper or cleaning the kitchen. Even the slow songs move forward with a methodical pace that would shame Baum's Clockwork Man.Favourite tracks are Joga, Alarm Call and Pluto. All three have their special charms, but most particularly I dig the beats on Joga, the lyrics on Alarm Call and the electronic effects on Pluto.This album doesn't rate a five simply because there's no song that combines all these elements perfectly. Still, a really good album, I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ethereal,Magical, and positively wonderful music from Bjork","review":"... An incredible array of musical genres including classical,trip hop, and some of the most stunningly sonic progressive jungle I\`ve ever heard. This is a showcase of her otherworldly voice and musical phrasing of her songs? (More like musical oddyseys or passages. More than anything else, this is Bjork\`s CD of pure release. \\"All Neon Like\\"(sexual orgasmic release) \\"Alarm Call\\"(anger release)\\"Hunter\\"(basic instinct release) and so much more if you really listen to the lyrics(WHICH YOU REALLY SHOULD!) This is one of the greatest pieces of recorded music in the modern era!..."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALmost to good","review":"Have you ever heard an album that was so good that it made you feel, ahh I dont know quite the right word but naughty comes close. This is so good it make you want to smoke. When I first listened to it I was cleaning, and by the third song I was on the floor feeling overwhelmed by the depth of emotion that was in the music. I love all the music Bjork has done, but this one touched me the most. I cant say that its for everyone, but if you want something more then all the bubble gum stuff that is made readily available on TRL you will find this refreshing."},{"rating":"2","title":"This may be my all time favorite album. And I own many.","review":"So many musicians can change lives. When I look back at the time of release of this album it just had longevity oozing out the speakers. And yep. About 15 years later it still sounds oh so good. This is my kind of album. Haunting, free thinking, and flows like honey. One smoking track one after another. I Think this may have been the pinnacle of her career and she still has the potential of making an album just as well if not better. Oddly enough from a guy's perspective. This album really helped me get over a first love experience in high school. I listened to it over and over again with a crushed heart. And it healed me in time quite a lot. Maybe for that reason alone sure I will admit. This is probably my favorite album that I have yet heard and ever heard in my life. A thank you note to Bjork and affiliates. Tune upwards. Tune onwards. Peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alarm call!","review":"I even have a limited edition digipak of this album, but I am really unhappy with it. After \\"Post\\" (one of the most important albums of the '90s), my expectations probably were too high, but I think \\"Homogenic\\" is one of Bjork's worst efforts. This arty project collapses in a heap of extravaganzas, pretentions, and lax song ideas. Despite the participation of Mark Bell (he once was a member of a groundbreaking British techno duo called LFO, releasing two innovative albums, \\"Frequencies\\" and \\"Advance\\"), it's unbelievable how plastic und ugly the techno beats sound. The orchestral arrangements are sometimes very whiny, and besides, this album completely lacks the sonic diversity of \\"Post\\". It's just one big mush of uninspired techno beats, affected vocals, and lame neoclassical tendencies. Even the remix collection \\"Telegram\\" was better. There's only one really good song here: \\"Joga\\", and its accompanying video clip is fantastic. Apart from this song, \\"Homogenic\\" is a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry to burst your bubble","review":"the lyrics are relatively below grade, compared to bjorks other efforts. the beats sound like a certain locust album, but not as inspired. she could have worked with any arranger/composer -- i found the strings to be tepid. she might as well hired gary numan to play an early 80s keyboard. and even though bjork has a very expressive voice. she seems to have stagnated vocally. which is dissapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs down","review":"With the exception of Joga, I really can't say I like this album. I loved Post, debut and even a few of the barmy songs she did with Sugarcubes, but Homogenic downright makes me cringe.To sum up: Bjork, you've got a terriffic voice. Let someone else do the song-writing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"pass","review":"i am bjorks biggest fan.i have every import mini bjork bootleg promo cd in the universe. i have a bjork web page, my own bjork secret stalker fan club. my girl friend looks like bjork, and i have legally changed my name to bjork. its on my drivers license. i plan on having many many children and naming them all bjork.however, i have one regret.if i could do it all over again, i would not buy this cd. i would spend the money on plastic surgery so that i could look like bjork. i would then kidnap myself and collect the ransom money from the record label. and then i would hijjack a plane and crash into the statue of liberty... i would buy a used copy of the cd with the left over money. only 2 or 3 songs are decent."},{"rating":"1","title":"YOU WILL NOT SEDUCE ME!!!","review":"BJORK-YOU CAN SING TO ME.

I think this album embodies \\"Bjork\\" on the whole. It's the most emotional, passionate, and listenable.This album is the standard everyone measures any of her latter work against.It's a definate classic!It's very intense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heterogenious and strange","review":"Although this album does not offer the homogenic songs the title suggests, you just get 10 delicious songs. The album is a special mark on Björk's carrer, where she goes even more alternative and sounds passionate and, as the same time, something is strongly cold on it, despite of thebooklet images showing fleshplants and blood. It's the portrait of a naturally paradoxal icelandic soul.The only fast track here is the fan-favourite chaotic Pluto; inspirational hits include Jòga and Bachelorette, both orchestral and electronic. 5 Years is totally nervous and beautifully full of noises, Immatureis an interesting lament and Hunter a catartic strong hit. All Is Full Of Loveis the magic end of the journey, and Homogenic, the best work Björk released ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful \\"emotional landscapes\\"","review":"Beautiful moments of inspiration frequently break through the ominous, overcast skies of Bjork's latest album, to the point where I disagree with the Amazon.com reviewer that any part of the album is \\"unlistenable\\" because of its mood. The minimalist techno beats that prevail in the background on all of these songs do get old on a couple of tracks, but I think the rest of the CD is incredible...many songs about different feelings brought out by love. My favorite songs in this vein are \\"Joga,\\" \\"Unravel,\\" and \\"All Neon Like,\\" bittersweet but wholly satisfying reflections on angst, separation, and healing a lover in pain. They leave you with the impression that there's a world of mystery and confusion that love invites. Bjork's lyrics are often rife with symbolism and it's nice to just sit back and think about the music as it takes you places."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!","review":"This is my favourite CD of Bjork, and it became my favourite very quickly: I heard a part of \\"Joga\\", and ordered the CD immediately. It has a wonderful rythm to it: very good to listen to, or to dance to. It also has this independent spirit, very exotic and modern at the same time - only Bjork could do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"her signature work","review":"Bjork has managed (if that was even possible) to top herself on this outing. Her inspiring arrangements show that she is one of the greatests artists of all time. Each song leads to a transcendent reality, which only she is able to tap into and experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insane music","review":"This artist is really INSANE! If some so-called artists called this music \\"art\\" they're really wrong and crazy. I've been listening Bjork's music a lot of times and I couldn't find an answer to his physically disordered mind. This album gives you a clear idea of how A DISORDERED MIND can produce music.Do not listen this music unless you have no sense of art and human spirit. This is not what european people listen everyday. Don't be fooled by the idea this is art-music. Go somewhere else, like Beethoven or Vivaldi music. Take this CD to trash!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An angel from Iceland","review":"This CD is just great, 5 stars are not enough.I first got introduced to Bjork watching her unplugged show broadcasted on MTV Europe...She was so experimental and not affraid to try new arrangements for her songs.Homogenic is like that with wonderful string arrangements, experimental electronics...From Hunter to All is full of love, it's like visiting Bjork's world (and not just Iceland) through her eyes.My favorite part is at the end of Joga when you can hear/feel Bjork's smile when she sings...Close your eyes and you will find yourself close to her. Amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN ACHIEVEMENT","review":"Björk has pioneered a new genre that others pop-divas only try to achieve. If you believed the hype about Madonna's Ray Of Light . . .then you should listen to where the ideas were concieved--- on Bjork's records and namely on (grammy nominated) HOMOGENIC. It is hear that dreamy strings contrast course beats, while Bjork's unique vocals fly over the top. These sounds merge and erupt into music. The more you listen to this album, the more it will reveal it's many layers to you. Too great to explain! A MUST HAVE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"bjork makes everything new","review":"This album takes everything that I ever thought about Bjork and music and turned it into something completely unrecognizable;however, because I was staring at my coffee table at the time I finished listening to the album and I knew that that was my coffee table, I couldn't immediately see the change that her voice and music had made in the things around me. Now, every time I look at that coffee table, I think about the song Bachelorette and how it made everything kind of jiggle and warp. I really was moved. She is an amazing artist, my world would be less of a world without her voice and vision. This album only makes me want more and more. She successfully meshes all opposing forces, spirituality and materialism, classical singing and techno-rave-space music. It is indescribable. I have heard no other artist do this so well so many times."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of Music for the Millenium","review":"No words can describe this experience. Let yourself go.

This album has changed my life. Let's try..."},{"rating":"2","title":"björk in love....","review":"This is one of the best albums ever made! jóga is just so beautiful, and all is full of love just flies through the room as you play it.

My first impression was that she was intentionally tryng to combine the sound of Janet Jackson and Celion Dion. However, when I played the whole CD (I bought it immediately, because the song sounded so promising) I realized that this talented woman has a unique style and sound. It's also quite refreshing to see a talented woman who puts her music before her image.

How many times do we have to hear the characters telling each other how much they love each other?(all that gooey sentiment -yuck) I have teenage sons and a daughter and we do not talk to each other like that! Rather than have the reader learn about the characters through action and decisions, she keeps giving us laundry lists of all of their qualities, ad nauseum. She didn't flesh out the characters, she just kept telling us about them. The reader never learns anything new about the main characters from page one until the last page (except for Stephanie).

It has a unique style. It's postmodern book and it can be best described as hyperlinked dictionary or encyclopedia. You should read it as a dictionary (you will find reading guide at the beginning) Most of the book is not actually about Khasars but about history and interconnected stories of different nations from Eastern Europe. It is anti nationalism and against all evils that come from religious wars. It's unique style will be problem for some people and it also require some history background. However everyone should read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you want something unique amd different go no further","review":"This is one of the most amazing books you will ever read.

It tells three stories of the Khazar polemic (one from the point of view of each of the major religions) along with the history of the actual book. All three versions of the story are essentially the same boring tale replete with overwraught metaphors and uninspiring characters. In the introduction (the most interesting part of the book) the author advises the reader to skip around using the index.

Yes, it's a perfectly good band playing good average AOR, but unless you are very young and joined them after the first 11 albums, you'll know that the original band DID NOT play on. This is just survival stuff, and good for them too. May they always play and make a living, as I love them dearly. But Chicago-music compared to its best? To remember what they are capable of, and watch what they actually have become now, is very sad. To gloss over everything with a blanket praise of everything good and bad, will neither serve the audience, nor the band themselves who could do with some realistic feedback. So yeh, if you have never seen them, this is worth a look, but if you remember what they set out to be, then forget this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deb","review":"This book was in good shape.

Besides the horrible gameplay, the menus are terrible! the dynasty mode does have a lot of cool features, but its still difficult to manage ur team, because the menus arent fluid. 2ks menus are always very easy to go through. Also u cant improve a plyers stats through dynasty like on 2K. The graphics are pretty good, if u like comical disney graphics!

Maybe the fact that you hardly ever heard of it was part of its allure. It wasn't played to the death. I don't know many people who like it or even know of it. The songs are wonderful, and I as a teenager found a special place in my heart. \\"I am sure\\", \\"Words I Need to Say\\", \\"The End of the Book\\" bring back great memories and are thoughtful, inspiring.

However, Michael W. Smith is definitely one of those rare artists whose albums, although 25 years old for this one, still reaches a new generation. Personally, I always thought the ones he wrote with his wife like \\"Hosanna,\\" on this one, were their best. What a songwriting team they make!

What I received is an inspirational book that is not only weak, but is lacking in grounded interpretation. The book has passages of scripture and then explanations/annotations of each passage.

Faced with a pregnancy at 15, she moved on and made a great life for herself. The love story is classic and will make anyone believe in true love. The one disappointment of this book was the ending.

I think the smartest character in the book is her ex-husband - he gets out in the first few chapters! The location has absolutly nothing to do with the story - just a gimmick to sell, sell, sell!

Last Saturday, I found a gently used one(excellent condition) at a yard sale for just $50. I disassembled it and brought it home where I thought it went together very easily, despite not having any instructions for it. It took two adults and 20 minutes to set it up, and my 23 month old instantly fell in love. We attached the tunnel on the upper level so as to challenge her, but she finds all of it simple enough to accomplish and enjoys the variety of climbing and sliding and peek-a-boos it offers. The only drawack that I can see is that it would not be feasable for an 8 yr old to play on, and she will probably outgrow or become bored with it in another year or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Versatile","review":"We bought this, several years ago.

We love it as do my boys (4 and 16 months) but unfortunately, the wasps love it too. The bright colours attract them and the gaps left where the pieces join together are apparently considered prime real estate for wasps to build their nests. I'm allergic to bees so I am in fear whenever we go in our backyard. I do a walk-around the structure every day, but between morning and nap there have been industrious wasps and so we can't play outside till my husband comes home and gets the nest down and sprays the living daylights out of the wasps or whatever these nasty things are.

We have also tried to reconfigure the tunnel and have been unsuccessful. I have encouraged him to play on it many times, but at two and a half he seems to have outgrown it and doesn't show much interest. We have other items by the same brand and are very happy with them.

As far as the difficulty of putting it together, I would much rather have to work on getting it together and know that once it is together, it will not fall apart.

So much for recommended age up to 8.The yellow archway connector over the big slide comes apart all the time, even a child can pull it off.

They trade off on some really jively vocals on this usually seriosu number an even the background musicians get in on the joy with an appealingly winking electric guitar punctuating some of the vocals.If you know the Ink Spots from Redd Foxx's impressions on \\"Sanford and Son,\\" you're in for a revelation.

His problem was over acting in every bit of the movie, he should learn that less is more sometimes but I think it's inherent in his style of acting. Kajol wasn't too bad except that someone should have told her to lose that mono-brow of hers before filming! The saving grace of this movie was the story line and some dignified and believable acting from the mother, the bad uncle and Salman Khan, thus the 2 star rating. Will I watch it again? Nah, unless it's to perversely amuse oneself by watching what bad acting is all about!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful movie, very bloody and violent","review":"I usually love Salman Khan and Shah Rukh Khan, but this was a terrible movie. I thought Salman fared better in it than Shah Rukh did. I really liked the two female costars, one of which was Kajol and I don't know the other one's name, but she was Salman's romantic interest. To me, she was the star of the show--what an incredible dancer! This movie is full of violence and blood. In almost every scene with the boys' mother, she was being beaten up and I got used to seeing her with blood on her head all the time. Even children were being beaten and killed. The only good thing in this movie was the dancing--that was it. The dancing was very traditional and very entertaining. But the movie itself? Awful, awful, awful. I give this movie one star for the dancing only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inviting book, inspired translation","review":"This translation of Francis Ponge is melodic and gentle. The tenderness and beauty in these poems seem, through Lee Fahnestock's translation, to come straight from Ponge himself. The simple, inviting book design and the lucid translation of the prose poems bring Ponge directly from another time and another place to the modern English-speaking reader. The book as a whole is a treasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read of Shayne's novels instead","review":"***Review containers spoilers***This is a novella, which centres on Puabi - a dark Immortal High Witch. She throws herself into the sea after her husband leaves her to burn in their house, as he runs off with his mistress. Matthew rescues her from the sea. Puabi could be the twin of his dead wife, Gabrielle.The story is about redemption and love and has an unbelievable happy ending.It was a compelling read but not a satisfying one - even though I knew I was going to get a predictable romance before I started reading. I don't usually mind that - so I guess I must have found other elements of the story unsatisfying and that is probably down to the length - not enough time for characters to be drawn properly and events to unfold at a natural pace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great short story","review":"As I didn't pay attention to the number of pages, I was shocked at how small the book was. It says 96 pages, but is actually only 84 in reading. But, short story or not, it was a great read! I thought it might be too far fetched, too sci-fi to be a romance as well, but Shayne made the characters very believable. Can't wait to read more of her books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"okay","review":"This is the first book I've read from Shayne's witch series. I wasn't expecting it to be a short story. It's actually 84 pages long. Needless to say I finished it in one evening. It was sweet and sappy like most romances are. What I didn't like about it was the fact that they fell in love with each other almost immediately. Reguardless of the fact that she was a total B***H to him. It was just sooooooo over the top. And then when she admitted to killing (and I don't mean just one-I'm talking lots) he seemed okay with that because he felt he murdered his wife because he didn't pay enough attention to her. Oh, boohoo!Sorry, but I think weakness is lame."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Well Dunne\\" of a Book!","review":"I think this book is excellent for students and people who are discovering the world of classic Hollywood.

Please realize that this book is intended for educational purposes (although it is entertaining at points about her life).If anyone wants to know more about Irene Dunne personally, then you should start collecting old movie magazines from the 1930s to the present. Otherwise, I would recommend this piece of well-written art, to anyone who is willing to learn about a great actress and a great human-being! Thanks for your tribute to Irene, Prof. Gehring.

Various overlooked and underrepresented groups in the media and world literature are given a voice too. Stereotypes and cultural ignorance is dealt with thoroughly. Not only does the author shoot down the upper-class white heterosexual male icon, she analyzes mentally, statistically and historically oppressed peoples own misgivings. All the while, the book is entertaining. bell hooks has a straight forward approach that forces one to look past his-story's rhetoric and recognize truths. hooks writes for those with a vocabulary, so if that's what you lack, grab Webster and learn a few words as you gain insight and recognition on cultural politics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect, but generally very good","review":"This blade is advertised as a general purpose blade and it is exactly that.

In 2004 I was given the song Whenever You're Ready on a playlist CD that was created by a friend but there were no titles for the songs. I had never heard anything like this song before and what really grabbed my attention is Coltrane's \\"A Love Supreme\\" bass line quote. Recently, I decided to look on you tube for this song and finally found it so I could buy the whole CD. All of the original songs are great (the retro sound of 1973 takes you back to better days in music) and there's a good cover of Inner City Blues as well.

I have read other R. Benson books that were good but this is plain garbage.It is such a rip off to \\"You Only Live Twice\\" for the romance. If you recall in the movie perhaps the book too but it's been sooooooo long since I read it:-), James falls for a girl, she gets killed and beds the next girl he works with in Japan (again). Plus she is only 20 years old. Give me a break! Bond is old enough to be her father. The storyline is hard to follow and you never have an understanding for the villian and why he acts the way he does. It is violent and bloody to read. Best advice, reread one of Ian Fleming's books like I plan to reread \\"You Only Live Twice\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Man With No Writing Skills","review":"It's a sad commentary on how corporations can annoint someone a best-selling author, complete with promotion accounts, regardless of whether the writer is any good at all.This book shows how consistently cliche, weak, and predictable Benson's Bond series remains. Ian Fleming could describe masterfully yet stay brief. Benson imitates this by describing every detail of a hotel lobby, thinking this makes it descriptive writing. It doesn't.The plot itself is predictable and formulated with all the usual characters to drag it along.Don't waste your money on this pap, even if you're looking for a light beach read. There are countless others to choose from, starting with Fleming's original work, soon to be reissued."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Boring Bond","review":"The idea of taking bond back to Japan was excellent as was the bits of info on Japanese culture. However, the novel was less than thrilling. Bond is written as a physically weak character which is not consistent with his reputation. The sex scenes are boring and the action slow. The 2nd battle with the dwarf was insulting to the reader after their fight in the Casseopia tunnel. Also, where were the gadgets, car chases, etc.? The novel does, in fact, read like a Japanese tourist brochure. Way too much detail! This is not Bond at his best. Mr. Benson, please bring back the Bond we love!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a comp vacation and tourist tripe","review":"This book is more Nihon merchanise description and expensive vacation video than a story.

He has a handle on the character and I truly feel as if it's Fleming's Bond that he's writing about. \\"The Man With the Red Tattoo\\" is a thrilling read with a timely plot (involving West Nile Virus) and some very suspenseful sequences. The \\"travelogue\\" aspects of the Bond novels have always been an important part and Benson applies his with aplomb. You'll learn some things about Japan while you read it but it does not detract from the exciting story. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"tourist brochure","review":"It's hard to get involved in plot when every other paragraph reader has to endure a Japanese expression which takes a paragraph to describe/explain. then there's the odd usage--tyre vs tire, which not even an Englishman like Ian Fleming used in his works, and Benson (American?) wasn't consistent in using them; then there is strange use of \\"storeys\\", rather than 'stories'or 'storys'. Even beyond travelogue, plot drags with no sense of drama, and logical gaps--as another reviwer pointed out, if you have bug-magnet, why not use beforehand rather than wait (too late) for flying mosquitoes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Faith Restored","review":"&#65279;After the purely mediocre \\"Doubleshot\\" and \\"Never Dream of Dying\\" not to mention the terriblemovie \\"Die Another Day\\" I was afraid I was losing my love for Bond.

I'd never even seen a Bondmovie when I read \\"High Time to Kill.\\" So seeing that I'd read all of Benson's other books, aswell as many of Gardner's and Fleming's, even Markham, I knew that no matter what I had toread \\"Man with the Red Tattoo.\\" I really didn't know what to expect. But in the end I waspleased. It was enjoyable. Benson is no Fleming, nor will he ever be. I won't pick onhim for anything, I like his books.

The story of Peacock and her family are well interspersed with stories of separate (though related, plotwise) people, and actual historical facts. The only thing was (and this is also, most likely, a historical fact) that this book heaped so much misery upon its characters that after a while, it just became 'things that happened.'

Chapters 19, 20, and 21 are absent from the book, which is odd, as the Epilogue managed to be included. So we have this odd jump to the end and I can't believe people who read this version weren't scratching their head and asking questions.The only acceptable solution for this is for the company that did the translation to ebook format go back and fix it.UPDATE: Amazon has worked with the publisher to get the missing material added.

The point is, it reads like a report to a general. And that's probably more what it is. Hal Moore is not an author, he's a retired Lt. General. Galloway was a reporter, not a novelist. They aren't going to write a nice neat book like Tom Clancy. The reality of the battle is to me reflected in the reality of how the book was written, namely in a manner I expect from a soldier, not a writer.

Let us hope that our collective memory for the fallen never fades away. They deserve to honoured and revered, just like our respect for the World War 2 & Korean vets."},{"rating":"2","title":"A detailed look at early battles that were precursors.","review":"\\"We Were Soldiers Once ... and Young\\" is a story of two of the first battles fought by US soldiers in Viet Nam. Although the soldiers fought well, the military failed to appreciate that the Viet Cong also fought well, and that this was not going to be a walkover. By concentrating on two actions, the authors examine details that would be lost in a larger survey. One of the most chilling is the lieutenant who tells his friends that he is going to win the Medal of Honor. Of course, what he achieves is to get himself and much of his platoon killed in short order. This book is an accurate guide to the tactics used in the early parts of the Viet Nam war. Finally, it shows how the Army expected the war to be won, and thus is a precursor for what would happen for years to come. An essential book to understanding how the war was fought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting. Heartbreaking!","review":"Wow! What a story! This is one war story that keep you driving forward until you reach the end ... with no coffee or bathroom breaks. You just have to know what happens.

Both of them are heros. If you want a picture of the beginning of the Viet Nam war, get and read this book. It's just an absolutely amazing story of grit and perserverance. Col. Harold Moore was a wonderful leader of men. Galloway was the only reporter that experienced the full horror of the battle. You won't be able to put the book down. These men have been interviewed on radio...their story is just incredible. It breaks my heart that we lost so many because of foolishness of the higher command."},{"rating":"2","title":"Facinating Book","review":"A MUST for any Military Historian focusing on Vietnam. You may have seen the movie. The book deals with the first major conflict with American and North Vietnam regulars. The battle itself set the strategy for the entire war. On one side (American) the idea was that we would seek out and kill as many North Vietnamese (and Viet Cong) so they would cease fighting due to loss of life. The North Vietnamese, on the other hand, thought that as long as they could cause a high casualty rate, the American people would protest and cause an end to the war. They were right."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you liked the movie then reading this book is a must","review":"I had the movie and book related to it.

That was very good at building a mental picture of the horror of the battle and its casualties. Then I watched the movie which also was based on Hal Moore's fight. I saw an interview of Hal Moore where he spoke of the later ambush and the errors of judgement that caused so many casulties. He also related his later meeting with the NVA officer who directed the opposing army tactics. Both seemed to have come to peace with the past while still mourning the losses of their men. This book encompases all 3 segments. The battle seemed easier to follow when listening to the tape and of course when watching the movie. The book seemed to have places where I lost tract of which group and at what location they were fighting. That is why I give the book 4 stars. But it sure provided an emotional kick by letting you feel the fear and uncertainty of combat."},{"rating":"2","title":"What it is Like","review":"A Vietnam Vet in the 101 that fought in this battle recommended this book to me for the \\"most realistic\\" experience of what it was like on the ground in Vietnam.

It is a tribute to the American fighting spirit, courage and the self-sacrifice of all Americans in all wars. The text was moving and flowing as if you had your rifle and were there. I did serve in Nam in 67 as a door gunner and operations spec. We who have been at war, any war, understand the sacrifice. It is a book like this that should inspire and affirm the American soldier.

Well, I was wrong, and this is the book that convinced me of this. This is without a doubt the harshest, most vivid picture of war I have yet to see between the covers of a book. Moore describes, literally, every moment of the most ferocious battle in Vietnam. And unlike the movie, which only shows you half the battle, he tells about the second big NVA attack that decimated the Americans. In this book you will see war in all of its horrific colors, like you have probably, never seen before. In fact it almost makes a war historian not want to study war any more. There is no glory here...only bravery and terror and horror and pain. Pleasse take time to read this book that is oh so different from the movie...you will not be disappointed..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems with facts stated by others","review":"I have read, with interest, We Were Soldiers Once And Young. I found a number of problems with some of the incidents stated. One vet whom I have interviewed presented a far different picture, one that criticized American commanders for an unnecessary number of deaths. It is important that battle history be as factual as possible, so future combat leaders can avoid pitfalls suffered previously. Amazon has asked that reviews discuss the book and not the author. But with this book it is impossible to criticize the book without criticizing the American commander, Hal Moore, for apparent battlefield errors. I agree that the book should be read. However, I believe all should not take the experiences communicated with self-interest by this author as being the gospel truth. The Vietnam War was lost by its incompetent senior officers... not by enemy offensives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry Yet Accurate","review":"Well I have to say this book definately was an accurate accountof what occured in Vietnam. The brutality and anguish the soldiers went through was accurately told but was dry as the Sahara desert. For a true war lover, or for somebody who wants an accurate account of war in Vietnam from people who were there it's good, otherwise I suggest the movie or a book that doesn't drag on."},{"rating":"1","title":"See the Movie","review":"Rarely does a movie shine when the book came first. Here is an exception. The prologue shows exceptional literary style and promise. The rest of the book (or as much as I suffered through) is so badly crafted that it is a wonder an editor let it through. If you are not interested in intricate details of Vietnamese generals, rapidly shifting points of view and uneven verb tenses, give this one a wide berth."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW. Everyone should read this.","review":"My dad flew in the Valley of Death just a few short years after Gen Moore was there. The descriptions of the terrain, battle, even the politics and diplomatic issues are just outstanding. This book should be required reading for American History classes. It's about darn time someone told the story without all the BS that being politically correct requires. Gen Moore, you told it like it was, and we thank you for that sir."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grant that peace may be in our days.","review":"War is a terrible waste. Beautiful lives horribly cut off. In that sense, \\"We Were Soldiers Once and Young\\" is a very disturbing read. When encountering graphic descriptions of combat, at Ia Drang, I imagined every soldier killed or maimed could have been one or both of my boys (in reality they had not been born during the Vietnam era). The heart break of the surviving spouse, child, parent is poignantly told. We should all be continually praying for peace. But, it is also a story of brave and honorable men. If war does come, I hope our soldiers are of the caliber of Moore and the 7th Cavalry. For those of you that served in Vietnam, thank you and God bless you. For those that made the ultimate sacrifice, \\"Their bodies were buried in peace, and their name lives to all generations\\" (Sirach 44.14). Thank you Lt. Gen. Harold G. Moore (Ret.) and Joseph L.

The account of the heroics and stupidity that combined to make the Ia Drang battle one of the most significant of the war is well documented. Very readable history. As a helo pilot in Vietnam I took part in many insertion operations and the author captured the heart in the throat feeling of being there.

Trying to gather comprehensible, story-telling scenes for a motion picture from this jumble of poorly written hodgepodge would have been very difficult-hats off to the screenwriter.Admittedly I, who read at least one to two books a week, was unable to get more than halfway through this one. I pushed myself hard to finish it, but reading again and again about the major screwups by field officers which caused the deaths of so many men and the way the commander (author) never placed blame or showed criticism for those junior to him made me lose all interest. Perhaps later in the book Moore court-marshalled them all and everything came out well in the end.

It pampers to the myth of the American heroic spirit in war. The purpose of the book is to glorify the \\" brotherhood\\" and \\"bond\\" of American soldiers using their superior firepower to inflict maximum kills on the enemy. The high moral tone of the book started with the mention about the Air Calvary's historical links to Custer. How can the authors take pride in associating themselves with a barbaric Indian killer? And like Custer, the US military in Vietnam thought they could take on the North Vietnamese Army whom they regarded as no more sophisticated than the American Indians slaughtered by them in the 19th Century.There was some tribute paid to the Vietnamese but it was done grudgingly. The only way the American soldier can prove himself is to take on an enemy with equal firepower.I am glad I didn't buy this book with its load of self-indulgent nostalgia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be entitled \\"We Were Soldiers Once Without Mission.\\"","review":"This is a great book. It teaches a great military lesson. The mission for any unit must be clear. It also seems to be an effort by the author to exorcise his demons. As a Marine Corps officer, I found it difficult to believe that these troops were thrown into such an amorphous operation. It basically seems like they were to locate the NVA and see how the enemy performed in battle. Well, the Cav definitely found out. The movement from the first LZ to the second was undertaken with no intelligence regarding the location of the enemy. The author calls this a victory simply because the NVA left the battlefield and suffered greater casualties.

I enjoy mysteries, especially those that offer many colorful characters, relationship problems and are of a contemporary setting.The book started out well and had my interest, but after about 100 pages, I had no clue where it was heading. Everything that was happening seemed to move along too frantically and at times, unbelievably. I never felt close to any one of these characters.Jeanne Cross was an exerciser (jogging) yet a pack-a-day smoker. Come on!Her son, overweight, though endearing, still evoked little empathy.The royally messed up lives of others (Ali, Brian, George) had me feeling that each one got what they probably deserved: Ultimately, I did not finish this book, mostly because I just didn't care to know the outcome of these character's lives.

From the very first page we are immersed in the lives of people who keep secrets. Patry takes us on a roller-coaster ride in the search for truth. We look behind every closed door, in every darkened room, and under all the beds. The people we meet are right out of our own lives and our own neighborhoods, and we watch them the way all neighbors would, as their lives come tumbling down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book..great suspense!","review":"Had never heard of Ms Francis before I picked up her book on a whim.

It read a lot like RL Stine's adult fiction which is overly dramatic and full of needless cliffhangers, like someone who is used to writing for teenagers and can't quite translate for adults. I thought the story was interesting, especially the twist, but it didn't really capture me like it could have because I was distracted by the awkward writing style. Luckily, I got it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"contrived twists","review":"The writing is plain, and while there are alot of plot twists, they are nonsensical and contrived. Important details are left out in the beginning and pop up later to wrap it all up. In fact the best \\"twist\\" to this book is the title itself. Don't bother buying this book.

Like most everyone else here, I bought Suzuki because I loved the K & D Sessions--a magnificient disc, groove heavy, with many many details. I suppose the problem here is that i expected Dorfmeister to be at least 1/2 of K & D. Because of the concept of synergism, I can tell you that D. alone is not even 1/8 the brilliance of K & D. Don't know why that is...but just listen and you can hear the difference. Totally lackluster. I admit there are some good tracks on the CD, hence the two stars; but by comparison they are unoriginal and uninspired beat tracks with a melody here and there. Don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Party Vibe, Down-tempo Collection Piece","review":"In my continuing search of \\"something different\\", I was pointed to this gem. Hmmmmm.......some of these tracks were used in TV commercials. Like K&D Session, my ears grew in love with this CD pretty quick. The design of the CD cover told me I was holding something worth grabbing. \\"Boss on the boat\\" keeps you moving even while sitting. My favorite tracks are: \\"Suzuki\\", \\"Orozco\\", \\"Honey\\" and for some strange reason, the sound of taps on a glass bottle turns my ears on in \\"The Key\\". \\"Doris Dub\\" sounds like a bad produced hip-hop track and \\"Pearl Off\\" wasn't a good ending to this CD. The CD, in my opinion, has it's \\"next track\\" moments but they are few and the gems are greater.....oNe"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Logical Progression","review":"Richard Dorfmeister makes a great artistic leap with Tosca's Suzuki (as does Peter Kruder with Peace Orchestra).

Lovely, zen-like and chock full of tasty beats!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Suzuki","review":"Tosca's Suzuki is not breaking any ground, but by God they have mastered the art. This album is just so professional sounding, very nicely produced. This is how I envision trance to sound like, so much garbage out there it taked a while to sift through and find a golden little record like this. Funky bassbeats and killer sounds. It's what they call ethereal....I think. It flows so well from track to track, quite the odyessy in under an hour."},{"rating":"2","title":"Va-va-vroooooom","review":"Overall, Suzuki lacks the color of Opera, but it's a catchier, more consistent, more refined effort.

It moves quickly; I was afraid of a tragedy at the end but the resolution is quietly reassuring and poignant. The grounding love is as much sexual as otherwise but that's understandable in view of the widely different backgrounds of Julie and Abu. And it is not transient but deepens. Miriam, Abu's sister, remains with me in her moving quietude, and the litle girl Lela, hand in hand with Julie, plucks deep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the time","review":"This book, in keeping our expectation from the author is exceedingly well written.

It's absolutely a must-have, must-read!And I DO believe that Hobbes comes alive when no one else is around."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Snow Goons are Here!","review":"One day, Calvin tries to create an snowman with the power 'invested in his and the Mighty Snow Demons'.

And, once again, who bears the brunt of this war? Calvin's parents who can't help but wonder how their son turned out the way he did.

I've been surprised how much of it is written with an adult in mind. We have drawn much amusement from these books. The Snow Goons isn't quite as rewarding as other C&H collections, but is enjoyable nonetheless. This is more a weekly format with black and white strip cartoons. None of the Sunday spreads are contained within this collection, where one really saw Watterson show off his stunning imagination. However, it is very much worth adding to the archives, especially for bedtime stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of Watterson's Funniest Calvin & Hobbes","review":"I first began reading Calvin and Hobbes in the newspaper around the time he introduced the Killer Snow Goons story, where Calvin builds yet another mutant, deranged snowman--but unlike previous strips, Calvin attempts to bring the snow goon to life a la Frankenstein, leading to the monster creating an army of similarly deranged snow goons.Watterson's artwork as usual is imaginative and humorous, and Calvin and Hobbes' interaction in this book are particularly hilarious. If you've never read C&H; before, consider this book a great place to start; long-read fans will also enjoy it as one of the best selections in the Calvin & Hobbes library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserves more than a 5!","review":"I loved Calvin and Hobbes when i was a little kid and I still do now!

The story embodies many of the virtues of the 30 or so Shute novels, all of which I have read:trust, excellence, devotion to what is right, willingness to go to extremes to do what is promised and it is told in a sometimes hilarious way through the characters.

BUY IT, dont steal there music"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Every Dollar","review":"When I first heard of Catch Twenty-Two,it was from one of my friends in the middle of language class.He told me they were his favorite band,and that I should buy the album.I did just that and I was completely amazed.This is the only ska album I own but I doubt if it will be my only one.Some of my favorite songs are: Keasbey Nights,Day In Day Out,Giving Up Giving In,On+On+On,This One Goes Out to...,and Kristina She Don't Know I Exist.All the the lyrics are down to earth and filled with things I can relate to.I would give this a higher rating if I could."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"WOw! this is one of the best CDs I own! When I first listened to it I was amazed with the talent of this band, there are some incredible solos! Being a trombone player myself I love the instrumentals that can be found in every song. Each song is totally upbeat and spectacular, this CD remains great all the way through. It's a great one to add to all you ska fan's collections, it's one of my favorites!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Give the guys credit for being popular","review":"I hate to say, but listening to this CD, i don't hear anything that hasn't really been done before by some other ska band that is just starting out. It reminds me too much of the Skolars (aka, Telegraph). When i heard \\"9mm and a three piece suit\\" back on Skarmageddon 4 (Moon SKA NYC, RIP) I thought, \\"wow, these guys are reall fast.\\" and that's pretty much it. The only difference is that most bands that put out music like this didn't last more than a year together. At least this band has stuck together, to carry the banner for every other band that broke up after high school.To me, Catch 22 is like cramming the popular ska songs of other earlier bands into one little nugget of mad-tempo skankin, song after song. But who cares? You could go out and buy any number of other bands' CDs and get the same effect. Pass on this and just learn you ska history."},{"rating":"1","title":"This ain't ska","review":"This records sucks. It's a silly trendy ska revival record: I don't hear attitude, I don't feel any ska music knowledge, I don't understand why people seems so mad about it. Maybe all the reviews are written by member of the band's friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"A legendry album","review":"I listen to a lot of ska/punk/jazz, but when i first picked up this album i was still totally blown away. The fused trad jazz and ska works so well, its a totally amazing album, in my opinion far better than any other catch 22 album.i would recomend it to anyone who likes anything from reel big fish+the mad caddies to maynard ferguson to five iron frenzy(another awsome band)when i bought it i thought it was by far the best album id ever heard,now ive listened to it too many times but its still an awsome album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE must-own ska album","review":"You can't call yourself a ska kid without this cd in your possession. Tomas Kalnoky, the vocals for this cd, did an outstanding job, his lyrics are among the greatest. You can also check out his work with his new bands, Bandits of the Acoustic Revolution, and Streetlight Manifesto. The horn lines are very good, the drums sound very tight. Every part of the band blend together seamlessly to create a great ska sound. Pick this one up today if you don't have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily one of the best skacore albums....","review":"Keasbey Nights took a while to leave my cd player once it was in. Easily 5 stars. It has awsome brass parts, awsome and unique vocals and is just all around well put together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not readable","review":"I love George MacDonald, but this is not readable and in old \\"something\\". I wanted the translated books and should have gotten a sample first."},{"rating":"1","title":"More frustration!","review":"I'm referring, of course, to there not being a 0 star rating. This is without a doubt the most useless, inaccurate, and misleading publication I have ever seen. Why? Well, each entry is followed by translations that are wrong or misspelled or committing some other dictionary-destroying information. To the dictionaries credit I did find that it was about 8% accurate. I calculated this by adding up all the entries (a rather limited and useless compendium of words to begin with) and determined from various sources which were accurate and which were not. About 8 in 100 fit the bill, meaning that 92% of the dictionary is just plain wrong! Since the author does not have the courtesy to point out which entries are properly handled, it leaves you looking like a sucker after buying this book. Do yourself a favor and keep clear of this book. Please keep way clear if you want any chance of learning any Spanish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless Classic!!","review":"This is one of the most wonderful love stories ever written. I first read this in 7th grade, and since then Robert Nathan has become my most favorite writer and \\"Portrait of Jennie\\" has become my most beloved book of all time. This is a timeless classic novelette. I am usually able to read this in one sitting, because the haunting story keeps me so hooked. The climatic, yet tearful ending only proves that love endures all things. If you ever feel depressed or hopeless, read \\"Portait of Jennie\\" and let it be your muse for inspiration as Jennie Appleton was Eben's muse during his time of hopelessness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting and Magic!","review":"I read this book only once, when I was a teenager, and I am in my fifties now. All these years I have remembered four lines from that book...: \\"Where I come from nobody knows/Where I'm going everything goes/The wind that blows, the sea that flows/And nobody knows.\\" I loved being in that story; it stayed with me 40 years!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Falling in love with a ghost on the time-space continuum story.","review":"\\"One must sometimes believe what one cannot understand. That is the method of the scientist as well as the mystic: faced with a universe which must be endless and infinite, he accepts it, although he cannot really imagine it. For there is no picture in our minds of infinity; somewhere, at the furthermost limits of thought, we never fail to plot its end. Yet--if there is no end? Or if, at the end, we are only back at the beginning again? . . .\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless","review":"What a lovely, timeless tale! Robert gave a slight twist to the usual time travel story. I was rooting for Jennie to come back. I knew she would. Yet there was still a surprise ending. Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incuribly romantic","review":"Portrait of Jennie is beautiful romantic fantasy. No violence, no sex- just a sweet tale of the power of love to inspire and make us believe in the impossible. It is probably too simplistic and old fashioned for today's young generation, but if you are an incurable romantic you will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful story that never leaves you.","review":"Reading this book as a freshman in high school, I could never forget bits and pieces of this unique novella. The only problem, though, is getting a copy of this rare out of print book. Searching for years, I finally found this copy and treasure it. The story is beautiful and it stays with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love endures","review":"Robert Nathan, the author of many dozens of short novels, usually taking the form of urban fables (sometimes with animals as the characters), was mainly concerned with one or more of the following at any given time: patriotism, team work, having faith in what you're doing, opposition to authoritarianism, and most of all, the enduring quality of love.In this novel a down-and-out artist (Eben Adams) in NYC meets a young girl named Jennie. She seems much older to Eben, as if she came out of a time machine from an earlier period. They fall in love, but mysteriously she insists she can't stay with him. And she vanishes from his life.Or so he thinks. Later in a hurricane off Cape Cod he finds her again; still later he learns that she drowned when she fell off a ship years ago. It's all a very strange lovelorn story of what was once in the past that is lost in current time. Nathan's message is clear, though: love endures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great film - Parts missing due to censorship!","review":"I agree with all the reviews before but one thing really makes me angry: in the version i bought here 5 minutes are missing. I watched this film in the german television and I know what they cut out! It's really hilarious!!! I suggest anybody else to look for the original version!"},{"rating":"2","title":"funny and soo realistic!","review":"I saw this movie with my friend and i really really liked it! Sure, its slow paced but thats what makes this movie so unusual. It's also very realistic and not soo fake, like other movies. It's like looking at a sneak peak into these people's lives. Also, its very funny too. Seeing Murray totally bewildered by these Japanese people. I thought it was a really thoughtful, in a way educated movie. Just a smart, worth watching movie. This is not a trash movie. Watch it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"LOST IN THE SCREENPLAY","review":"The film certainly creates - in a convincing way - the atmosphere that would make it difficult for an uninspired foreigner on a short stay in Tokyo to be anything but bored. Unfortunately the proliferation of simple sentences made up of simple words in the screenplay not only made it boring for this viewer but also failed to convince me that any meaningful relationship could develop between the young wife (Johansson) and the older actor (Murray). The screenplay was unable to lift the film above the level of the \\"elevator\\" music that anaesthetized the patrons of the hotel bar. I gave it 2 stars for atmosphere and the film work. The non-plot and non-acting was worth a big fat zero.This DVD is not worth owning or renting."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you watch movies to escape - skip this one!","review":"Okay, I'm getting tired of all of these artsy-fartsy \\"day in the life\\" movies. I'm frustrated that after watching LOST IN TRANSLATION I will never get back the 2 hours of my life I gave away. If you like movies without any real point, this is for you. If you like to see your favorite comedic actors in dramatic roles, this is for you.Bill Murray is not only NOT FUNNY in this movie, he's downright boring. The jokes that are in the film are rehashed from years ago - like when the director of the commercial talks for 2 minutes straight and the translator tells Murray \\"He want more passion.\\" Murray - \\"That's it? That's all he said?\\"That was the funniest part of the whole movie.Skip this turkey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as I expected","review":"I've lived in \\"foreign\\" lands all my life. There is no excuse for Hollywood Romantic \\"interludes\\". I followed my wedding vows - I felt they were important, thus didn't like the whining and the \\" feel good \\" aspects of the story line. Both protagonists were despicable to me. I am a reasonable man, but dislike the tone of \\"rationality\\" which seems to permiate our culture - especially in this film, which was not funny in the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"The longest 90 minutes I ever spent in a movie theatre","review":"I love Bill Murray and his deadpan delivery and he is terrific in this film. And Scarlett is very good, too. However I don't understand all the fuss about this film. Yes, I know the characters were bored and lonely and I guess the director wanted us to feel their boredom, too. Well, she did a great job of conveying that feeling because I was bored to tears. The photography was ugly (for some strange reason the photography looked better on TV ads. But in the theatre on a big screen the film looked under exposured with flat colors). You would think since these characters were so bored and lonely they would go out and find something interesting to do. Nope. I kept waiting and waiting and waiting. Is Bill and Scarlett attracted to each other or not? It's not that I wanted them to have some predictable affair I just wanted to understand what was it they found so appealing in each other. Sorry, I wanted to like this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"tedious","review":"This is perhaps one of the most tedious, mind-numbing films I've ever seen. Can't imagine what all the hype was about. Don't waste your money or your time. It is dull, slow, and has no redeeming features beyond a tawdry view of Tokyo nightlife."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooorrrrrrrrring","review":"Bill, please get back to doing movies like Stripes! I have no clue what the academy saw in this movie (they must be 60+ in age).. If this movie was on in the Dentist office I would recommend the Musak machine instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way overrated.","review":"I like Bill Murray but this film is way overrated for it's own good. It's not even remorely funny, and its drags it feet to the boring end.I like Bill Murray but he can't save this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superb? Oh, come on!","review":"This movie was boring, almost beyond belief. The woman I saw it with kept nodding off, and when we left the theater she asked, \\"Did we go to the right movie? Was that the movie all of the critics were raving about?\\" She had it right, even though she snoozed through about a quarter of the film.Murray almost saves it with about ten minutes to go, by putting in a strong final show of his innate acting ability. The problem is though that the movie is so painfully slow up to that point, that it cannot be saved, ultimately. I would pass this one by."},{"rating":"1","title":"haha... 5 stars? you're kidding right?","review":"WOW! i'm sorry, but did i miss something here? This movie was horrible. A normal movie lover, i was bored out of my mind tossing and turning staring at my wall, pausing to go to the bathroom, running downstairs for some food... even fell asleep once. what a waste of the $15.00 i paid for it. maybe im missing something but this cheepo shot in tokyo looks like it cost $200 to make, and was a pointless movie. all in favor that johnny should have won the Acadamy award instead say Aye..."},{"rating":"1","title":"visually nice, weak otherwise","review":"mainly this has to do with the locations and in even worse case the whole seems to boggle into a travelog. There really isnt much here. there isnt a storyline to speak of and the pace is the slowest ive ever seen. Bill Murrary has a few funny lines and his performance is understated but too much of the movie is spent in silence. Scarrlett johansen is ok as the love interest. The movie seems far to concered with visuals and making the location Japan itself more the focus as if it were a charachter, i couldnt help myself but lose interest.it also doesnt help the movie seems over self indulgent and disconnected. The movie goes nowhere and ends the same way.the movie had the potential of giving Bill Murrary something to do but instead it focus' less on the charachters and more on the art school visual que's. For me its all mostly about the charachters and plot. this one seems lacking in both"},{"rating":"1","title":"COMPLETELY LOST on this film...","review":"Folks, I don't own this dvd, but I recently rented it. I have to say it did not live up to the hype. Don't get me wrong, I normally LOVE Bill Murray, but somehow I think this is not one of his better storylines. Blah, very. Or maybe it just wasn't my style? Try it out and see if you agree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly, Opens with Mandatory Commercials","review":"This is a touching, understated film deserving four stars, but on DVD it opens with a long set of mandatory commercials -- the Menu function is disabled so you must watch the commercials before you can watch the movie. It's hard to recommend purchasing a product that forces you to watch advertising, and I can't give it more than two stars.I believe Amazon should inform people when a DVD contains mandatory advertising."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll never get that time (or money) back","review":"This movie had a little bit of humor, but overall, I was anything but amused. I don't understand what the big deal is about a movie of two bored people who never really get \\"unbored\\". They bored me. I kept wondering when this movie would take off...reminded me of seeing \\"A Thin Red Line\\" or \\"Ghost World\\" - just boring. I won't ever get that time back that I lost watching this film (or the money)."},{"rating":"2","title":"What happened?","review":"When I was growing up the favorite films of my generation were movies like \\"Bonnie and Clyde\\", \\"2001, A Space Odyssey\\", \\"Death in Venice\\". Today I see audiences who find even \\"Lost in Translation\\" too slow and uneventful for them.It's depressing to think that the schlockiest of the film-makers are right and all today's audiences can handle is the awful umitigated [nonsense] that they have been throwing at us for years. Feed people slops for long enough and all they'll want is slops.The negative reviews here make the world safe for the likes of Roland Emmerich. What a horrifying thought.I live in a culture that's not my own, and where people make fun of the differences all the time, from both sides of the divide. \\"Lost in Translation\\" is dead on in its analysis of a short term encounter. It amazes me that people can't see anything happening here. Decisions are made. People grow. It's a beautiful film from a brilliant script. Those who can't see it had better enjoy their slops"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please go out watch more movies","review":"For those who \\"got\\" this movie, I initially wonder what one has to smoke to like this one? Then I realize they actually have not smoked enough, not seen enough movies so to say.I've read previous reviews of both sides... those who can see what this movie really is - ball of nothing, are the type who typically watched lots of movies, esp. independent and foreign. On the contrary, those who love this movie are the ones probably not seen enough movies.So you go figure.Then another fellow reviewer is probably right: do yourself a favor, go out and watch more movies. After you watch 50 of top-notch independent movies, come back to \\"lost in translation\\", you probably get lost too...Well the thing is you may not hear other indes as much since they probably don't have such strong marketing/publicity as \\"lost in translation\\" or not that many wooing critics (God knows what they wooing for) to start with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely lost","review":"You have to watch this movie without expecting it to go anywhere and then you might be able to appreciate the interesting cinematography and subtlties of expression in the actors. I didn't know that when I watched it and I kept waiting for something to happen. The movie is also hard on Bill Murray's character's wife--making it seem that she isn't justified in calling him and telling him he should be at home. He should be at home. His wife is right. He might be less depressed and lost if he went home, instead of staying away longer than he needs to and swooning over a girl half his age who is married to someone else. Speaking of Scarlett Johansson, her character comes on a business trip with her husband and then acts hurt that he's not spending more time with her. This movie caters to all the selfishness in people and makes it seem justifiable and right. Good camera work, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"An over-rated film","review":"I love Bill Murray. I love Scarlett Johannson. Still, I was counting down the minutes until the DVD was over. Watching two downbeat characters mope about lives overly contrived by a screenwriter (yet somehow incredibly unimaginative) is not my idea of a good film. For something truly profound, with a profoundly moving character in a terribly lost life, see \\"Five Easy Pieces.\\" For something imaginative and truly philosophical, with a lost soul who manages to connect with another lost soul (at least for a while), see \\"Donnie Darko.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The more you know who you are, and what you want, the less you let things upset you\\"","review":"I was never a big fan of Bill Murray, but when his comedic abilities are used perfectly to portray the ultimate cynical stranger, a great actor is revealed.Murray and Johansson are two strangers faced with life's emptiness in Japan who bond as two spirits, two friends and maybe more! The question remains; if you are a stranger everywhere, does it make a difference what country you are in???This is a very smart and deep movie that will leave you wondering, do you know yourself well enough? Do things still upset you like before? Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Narcissistic bore","review":"To compare this movie to American Beauty is completely off base.This movie is neither a penetrating investigation into mid-life crisis nor does it provide the least insight into Japan, either modern or cultural.The awards it has gotten are purely the movie industry's way of rewarding its insiders and they make a mockery of the supposed integrity behind the awards process.Bill Murray has done some great work; this movie does not add to his reputation. And, to be a famous director's daughter! We should all have such credentials. The idea that a director's reputation is tied to the quality of the work has always been somewhat suspect, but this movie really shows how corrupt the internal Hollywood processes are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misrepresented","review":"Awful. Not a comedy by any stretch of the imagination. How anyone could call this movie \\"flat out hilarious,\\" as a Rolling Stone critic did, is \\"flat out lying.\\" Bill Murray fans, don't be fooled! There is nothing in this flick remotely like the Murray we know from Stripes, What About Bob, Caddyshack, The Man Who Knew Too Little, Scrooged, Meatballs, etal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, hum.","review":"I recognize the humor of highlighting the lost feeling people have in a high-velociy culture that seems so totally foreign in so many ways. However, for me this movie was two hours or so of angst. When it was finally over, my wife and I watched \\"Ghost Busters\\" to remind me why I ever found Bill Murray funny. Guess I'm too shallow to enjoy movies like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone Shoot Me!, Please!!!","review":"If I could have the 2 hours back I spent watching this movie, I would rather have spent my time licking my own ass or get beat over the head with a baseball bat! It was Long, Drawn out, and boring. Not once did I attempt to laugh, it would have hurt too much. The \\"Artiness\\" of the movie was nonexistent. It was crude toward Japan. Mocking them many times and showed them as boring and crazy. I would recommend that you take a boxing glove put it on and pound your head before you glance at this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get all the hype","review":"I didn't get it. This movie received all this hype and I was excited to see it. Boy was I disapointed, this movie had no point, no ending, no meaning. The story is old man meets young girl, old man and young girl party, old man leaves. That's it. Nothing happens. Save 2 hours of your life and pass on this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is an insult!!!","review":"This movie is boring and stupid. Don't buy this DVD or rent the movie. I can tell you right here everything that happens in the movie so save your money. Bill Murray goes to Japan to film a commercial for a local whiskey. He is bored and meets the wife of a photographer who is also bored. They go together to a few stupid places and develop some platonic relationship. In the end he leaves to the U.S. and she stays in Japan. The end. Sucks huh? I can only say that this movie was done becuse of the Coppola name behind it. If some unknown would have written this junk they would have been laughed at."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Cannot believe this movie is up for Best!!!","review":"I ask you this, if you were in a far away place, FREE would you be sulking in your hotel room!!!. Was there nothing this beautiful land had to offer except a trip to a strip joint?? I think these people were depressed. What ever it was it was not worthy of 2 hours of a bad reality show of a business trip. I asked people who say they loved it to describe to me WHY they did and WHAT it was about and no one really knows. I think it is a case of \\"lets just hop on the band wagon\\". A great injustice to truly great writers directors and actors. I dont think this took much talent at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pleeeze, Bill Murray is NOT funny","review":"Bill Murray cannot be considered a comic, this man is not, has never been and will never be funny. OK, so you insist he is funny? Did anybody see the David Letterman interview with Ms Coppola? She brought in a tape of Murray doing some kind of dance, was that supposed to be funny? I didn't find it even slightly humorous. Murray sucks as a comic."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST MOVIE IN THE WORLD","review":"this has no plot what so ever. it's dull and nothing ever happens in the movie.

Little wife feels alone because she's traveling with her working husband. Boohoo...get a life, go for a walk or something, are we supposed to feel sorry for her cuz she's a stranger in a strange land??? As for Bill Murray\`s all star performance, give me a break. The dialogue is weak, the plot is weak, the movie left me with wonder. The wonder of how a movie this \\"thin\\" and void of any substance could win anything at all.....If you don't like your life then change it and quit whinning already....stop playing the \\"poor me\\" and change what you don't like...this movie sucks..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vacuity","review":"Saturday Night Live used to do a skit called \\"Bad Cinema\\".

How this movie was even nominated for any awards--let alone--win any is beyond me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and vulgar","review":"I don't care what other people say about this film: IT IS BORING AS WATCHING YOUR HARD DRIVE REFORMAT ITSELF. It has no plot. It's just one boring event after another, spiced with vulgar elements that do nothing to help the story. This movie sucks. If you want to watch a foreigner trying to fit into the Japanese culture, watch Wasabi instead. It has humor, action, and a 45 calibur revolver. LiT will likely end up \\"Lost in the back of my mind\\" within a few weeks. It is JUST THAT BORING. The one star I give this movie is because it has some nice footage of Tokyo and the Japanese culture, and because I like Bill Murray, even if he was poorly used in this movie and wasn't 1/10th as funny as he was in his other movies (in fact, he's not very funny at all here). This movie deserved to get snubbed at the oscars, as much as it pains me to say it. I'm not even sure if it deserved the one oscar it got (which I can't even remember what it was)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bill Murray in a coma","review":"This is an impenetrable chick flick featuring Bill Murray in acting so low-key I thought I was watching Kim Novak in Bell, Book & Candle. The scenery is LOW, LOW budget (like Ginsu knives), the non-English is apparently improvised -- in fact background dialogs are directed as \\"wall of sound\\" noise, and subtitles are NOT available. The high point of the script is a sophomoric flipwit about Yale philosophy majors working pro bono, and it doesn't get better. Coppola made it out of the basin ok in Godfather I, but she drowns in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please stop the pain!!!","review":"Simply awful!!!After seeing the glorious Hollywood ads eulogizing the theatrical masterpiece, \\"Lost in Translation\\", I was determined not to miss another supposedly great movie. But, little did I know the emotional pain and mental anguish this movie would dragged me through. 102 long excruciating minutes of pure boredom. Anyone who can establish a plot or even a worthwhile excuse to sit through the foreign dialogue and lack of entertainment this movie presents deserves a medal. I wish someone would have gave me forewarning before sitting through this absolutely mindless torture. Any central storyline or theme this movie tries to convey is certainly \\"lost\\" in pointless bull. Ultimately, this gargantuan snooze-fest can easily be summed up into one word--\\"lost in translation\\" = MEANINGLESS"},{"rating":"1","title":"Racist garbage","review":"People, most of the critics of this movie still don't get it. Maybe Lost in Translation is a bit slow,... so what. My beef with this movie is the portrayal of the Japanese. It's like they're in the movie for the main actors' amusement. So what if they get the \\"L's\\" and \\"R's\\" switched around. Did you ever think that it's cuz English isn't their native language? How many times did the main characters make attempts at speaking Japanese? It's just another racist film trying to paint a picture of the \\"superiority\\" of white Amerikkkans.

Not only is there hardly any conversation going on the movie follows two different characters in Japan who basically do nothing. I tried to give this movie a chance but after about 15 minutes decided I'd leave and do something more productive, like bite my fingernails. I guess it's true what they say: if critics like a movie then it probably stinks. Such is Lost In Translation. Film of the Year? Shhyeah, riiiiiigggghhhhhttttt."},{"rating":"1","title":"A movie about nothing","review":"You know how Seinfeld is a show about nothing? Take out all the funny jokes and witty banter.

We do have a very eccentric pop culture in Japan, but that is not all we have. Japan is not only sushi, samurai and stupid TV shows. The movie put too much forcus on describing the silly part of Japan and not on the other part. I guess that's because it is based on Bob's view of Japan only, but how many people who saw the movie would actually realize it?The message I got from the movie was that there is no understanding between American and Japanese culture. The American people in the movie did not even mix with any Japanese, and all they thought was that Japanese can't speak English, which is pretty natural, and they made fun of it.It made me really sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"short review","review":"i don't have much to say about this. i fell asleep 20 minutes through it. i'm not sure what happend in those 20 minutes, due to the fact that it was flat out UNINTERESTING.and that's it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow that was boring....","review":"This movie was boring and lacked anything interesting.

Shame on them"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Incredible movie ever","review":"Sophia Coppola's Lost in Translation is incredible from start to end. Every scene in the film seems to be perfect and one cannot help but to fully empathize with both Mr. Murray and Ms. Johansson. Mr. Murray, always wonderful to watch, turns in his best preformence since Groundhog's Day, and Ms. Johansson has signalled her arrival as an incredible actress, even while so young, with her perfect portrayal of lost Charlotte.I have been watching and studying movies for 40 years, and I can honestly say that this is the best movie I have ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie about loneliness.","review":"Lost in Translation is not your average movie. It's more of a thinking comedy about people trying to connect in a city that is hard to fit in with. Sofia Coppola does a great job with the majesty of Tokyo but also shows the way people can get lost in it's huge tapestry of culture. Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson are great as the two lonely people trying to connect with themselves and the outside world, and we, the viewer are taking though this journey with them and are intrigued with their misadventures together.It worth the word of mouth that it's getting, and I hope Bill Murray gets the Oscar because he is that good in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like it....","review":"I was expecting a comedy and found a tragedy instead.Lost in Translation is a haunting drama displaying the emptiness and rootlessness of western culture; especially westernized Japanese culture. With stark character portrayals of an aging American actor and a young American wife, their out-of-place feelings for Japan mirror the same feeling of their domestic lives.I found the show tedious, flat, and empty."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a wierdo","review":"I have checked back and it does appear that some guy is writing like a dozen 5 star reviews one after another.

It is a shame that the few who actually liked this film have to resort to in essence stuffing the ballot box in order to keep the score inflated. There are many poeple who reply on these ratings before deciding whether to spend hard earned money and it is a real diservice to them to write multiple reviews under false pretenses.

It is one of the most boring movies I have ever suffered through. In the beginning, you are not sure what's happening, but you're sure that it's slow and dull. About half way through, you finally understand what the movie is about and where it's going and you are extremely disappointed. Finally, you reach the end and if you are still awake, you are feeling extremely unfulfilled and robbed. I don't understand where all the hype comes from. It must be one of those movies that people don't dare to hate because somewhere along the line it became \\"cool\\" to like it. You will feel robbed even if you don't pay money to see it.

A depressed boring has-been actor meets a depressed boring unhappy young wife and they do unmemorable things in Japan. The screen chemistry between the main characters is about the same as between a brick and a bar of soap. Bill Murray acts like he is pumped with Thorazine.This is truly one of the dullest, worst movies that I have ever seen.

Overpromoted, oversold, full of itself, snob-trash.Perhaps it's not chic to put down a movie that has someone with the last name of \\"Coppola\\" in the credits, ergo the raving critics. That this turkey can even get near the \\"best anything\\" list of nominees is a crime. One of the few movies that I really wanted my money back at the end. I hear the DVD is awful too.

Why? The story is so absolutely boring. It goes no where. I have a $15,000 home theater, and I love good and bad movies. My friends got so excited after I told them about the reviews, the golden globe awards, and the oscar nominations. One hour through the movie we were all crying out loud, \\"stop the movie.\\" What's shocking is not that it's a bad movie. I would have tolerated it if the reviews said that it was, but critics were flipping A's and B's all over the place for this movie. I can't understand it.Don't believe them. It's horrible. It'slow. And finally, the movie's trailer was mostly taken from the first few mintues of the movie. There were a couple of laughes in the first 20 minutes. Then, nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"LONELY DAYS, SLEEPLESS NIGHTS","review":"Bill Murray gives perhaps his most understated, and sensitive performance to date in this near-perfect gem of a movie, and Scarlett Johansson showed a poise way beyond her age at the time this pic was made. The chemistry between the two leads is wonderful, and Sofia Coppola's deft direction of her screenplay is equally dynamic. She ( Coppola ) gives a fresh twist to what might have been just another forgettable, May-December romance, and weaves it into a searingly funny, extremely moving, and pretty damn near cliche-free character study. What makes this film work so well is that though these two very different, obviously lonely people, seem entirely meant for one another they manage to avoid doing the expected, and in the process create a much more poignant and compelling statement about love than might have been if the story had ended differently.Still, one can't help wondering what Bob whispered to Charlotte before they parted...."},{"rating":"2","title":"This film really grabbed me","review":"I rented this movie on DVD because I've always liked Bill Murray and was intrigued to see a movie for which he won a Golden Globe award as an actor.The movie sat in my room for days -- looking at it I wasn't overwhelmed to watch it after all. I decided to watch it finally, as I'd paid to rent it.I became lost in their world for two hours, and at the end of the movie I felt horrible for the two main characters. As another reviewer wrote, I really felt that Bob was leaving Tokyo and Charlotte was staying, and my heart ached for them. I was completely drawn into their relationship, brief as it was. I loved the acting. I loved the script -- it was funny where it needed to be, and serious where it needed to be; and Sofia Coppola didn't feel the need to put too many words into the actors mouths during intimate and/or uncomfortable moments.I've never felt compelled to write a review about a movie ever before.

The idea is great, being lost in a foreign place and making an unlikely connection almost like an out of body experience where your \\"realities\\" are waiting for your return.The idea of the story was almost at complete odds with the movie. Acting was bad, and directing too. I was happy that the story was recognized by an Oscar, but not the movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"LOST IN MEDIOCRITY","review":"Probably the most overrated film of the year. A good word for this movie is DULL, because it goes nowhere fast. Bill Murray is a has-been actor from the states filming a commercial in Japan. While there and bored he meets Scarlett Johansson, who is also bored. They get together and are bored together. Its contagious and quickly spread to the audience. Not sure what the buzz is about. Murray's talent is clearly wasted here.Rent or buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT BLU RAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"The image quality of this movie is just TERRIBLE!!! Image looks washed out, grainy and color is bad, some scenes looked worst than VHS. I purchased Trading places with Eddie Murphy and for being a much older movie it had much better image quality. I have a 55 inch Samsung plasma 3D tv. What a rip off this movie is!!! I can not believe it is legal to sell such crappy product with a Blu Ray label on it. I am sending it back for a refund. It looks like I am watching VHS on a really expnsive tv. For those of you reviewing the movie itself, GET A CLUE!!! This is AMAZON NOT IMDB!! We should all help each other and describe the quality of the blu ray so others dont waste their time and money on garbage like this!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I have to agree it was boring","review":"I do not consider myself a movie watcher who needs action/adventures to be entertained. In fact, I had high hopes for this film, but it was very disappointing. The beginning is slow; the ending is meaningless, and, as for the rest, it was difficult to find a plot. If we were suppose to understand the lonliness of the characters or the difficult times during marriages, I think that it could have been presented in a much more engaging way.I think that most movies should be watched, just for the experience, but no one should buy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"This has to be one of the few movies where someone received a best director nomination even though you could see the boom mic in several scenes LOL!!

What is this? The Coppola girl got an Academy Award for this I think. I believe it was.... WRITING??!?!?!?! Yes... Sofia Coppola got a writing academy award for this movie. There was no plot. There was nothing original and nothing that took any effort. Seriously, they just took some cameras and filmed shots of Japan. That's art? Don't be fooled by the Writing award, I could of written this movie in 3 seconds. Sofia isn't a genius or anything, she probably didn't even use a script.This movie goes nowhere really. I don't watch movies to see the scenery. I don't come out of movies turning to people saying, \\"Did you see that scenery, that was so f'in brilliant!\\" This movie is bad and you can't cover that fact up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...","review":"Boring. what else can I say? I used to travel alone alot but I can't connect myself to this film. Will I share a bed with a stranger? No. Not even my close friends under any normal circumstances (seriously). There are so many things to do, to see, and to film in Tokyo; and I don't understand why the director, Sophia Coppola, picked a hospital and made fun of the people there. Just plain boring. But I find the Karaoke scene interesting because this is really part of the Japanese culture and that storyline should be developed more. Afterall, it'd better to have more communications among the characters in the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, I get it","review":"This movie could have been so much better if it had avoided the absurd portrayal of Japanese people. That wasn't good and hurts the film in the long run. Yes, I can relate to the loneliness of these two characters and finding someone to share that with. Everyone at one point or another has felt lost at certain times in his or her life, highschool, young adulthood, relationships, mid-life identity crises...the list goes on and on, but I couldn't understand why these two characters were so weak, especially since they are unhappy with thier lives in America, wouldn't it make sense that they be interested in alternative lifestyles? It wasn't believable that two people in an interesting foreign country would be so fridgid about experiencing the different culture there unless they were snobs. It's a shame that we don't get to see what happens when they get back to America and how they deal with their problems there. That would be a very interesting movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can't really call it a movie.","review":"There is no plot and there is no acting. Bill Murray didn't even have a script. I watch movies to be entertained, not bored. This is the second movie I could not even finish (the first one was Pi) because it was so boring. I don't know how to explain it any further, there is no plot! It's as simple as that. I would not recommend this to anybody who still enjoys movies with a plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"This is a boring movie about boring people being bored. If I wanted to watch that, I'd just sit in front of a mirror.I understand that it's a pseudo-art film. I understand that Murray isn't supposed to be funny in it. I understand that the connection between the two characters is supposed to be charming and not sexual. I know that life and the people you encounter will generally be a disappointment. But I knew all that before I pushed play and I don't know any more after watching, so it was basically just a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bit of a Disappointment","review":"Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson have surprising on-screen chemistry despite a massive age difference. I must disagree with someone's comment that acting \\"real\\" isn't acting. If it isn't realistic, then it is hammy, so what do you look for in acting? The story, however, is a little dull for my tastes. All though this film does an excellent job of creating the illusion of reality, I prefer the movies where something actually happens. This storyline has no hook, nothing to keep the audience in the seats. And, it doesn't help that the film portrays the Japanese as obnoxious, which couldn't be further from the truth. The viewer is left depressed, irritated, and a little bit drowsy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coppola couldn't figure out what to write...","review":"hence, the whisper, that frustratingly unintelligible whisper. I am dismayed that this poorly-written movie was not only nominated for a screenplay award, but it actually WON! It is just ludicrous.Murray did not deserve that nomination (yes, he was humorous, in that deadpan way of his; when Johanssen laughed, I laughed, but that is not enough to garner an Oscar nod ). But even more so, Coppola did NOT deserve those three Oscar noms, and to WIN for Best Screenplay is just plain WRONG.This is exactly a two-and-a-half star movie -- not great, not terrible, just exactly there in the middle. It is no wonder that many of these four and five star customer reviewers don't just review the movie, they also insult other customer reviewers. They obviously lack heart, just like the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tripe","review":"This movie tries desperately to express the struggle two people undergo to find meaning in their lives. Unfortunately, the expression of the whole concept of what it means to be human is overdone and tedious, and the main characters are unsuccessful in appearing complex and multi-dimensional in their journey. Instead, they seem spoiled, ungrateful, and just plain bored. All the scenes showing the main characters looking out of windows or looking into their drinks become annoying when you see them for the 99th time. I understand what this movie was trying to express, but it failed miserably and instead comes across as an immature and underdeveloped low-budget film that happens to have a big star in it and an association with another famous director. The Coppola reputation and Bill Murray's talented performance can't salvage it, unfortunately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Letdown","review":"I think the popularity among critics is that it shows an 18 year old playing a 20-something who actually has an attraction to a geezer. Speaking for all geezers, it gives us hope. An otherwise bland and boring film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh kami , this su'u!","review":"Why even go to Tokyo, if you're going to shoot 90 percent of the movie inside a hotel?The characters were boring, and the movie was about them being bored. So guess what? I was bored. If it was supposed to be a comedy, it failed because I didn't laugh once.Usually, in a drama the characters experience a change by the end of the movie. There was no change here. I guess I lost the point. Maybe if you are going through a midlife crisis, you can relate to this waste of film.DTS? Why?"},{"rating":"1","title":"lost in translation","review":"Having read the reviews of others, I deccided to revise mine.Why make an intelectual debate over such a non-intelectualmovie ?? what rubbish!!the plot was silly, the script didnot make sense , we are in 2004 and not 1934.Coppola saidshe made the movie only for bill murry, she is right ,noother well known actor would play such a boring part unlesshe wanted a free trip to expensive tokyo. those who liked this movie, OK , but do not try to make it out to be intellectualas it is not. it is cheap movie , give me edward burns anytime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aptly Titled","review":"From all the movie critic reviews, I thought I was getting either an artsy film or a comedy. I got nothing instead. This is the most pointless and boring film I've seen since \\"About Schmidt\\". I know where Coppola was going with the film, as I have been stuck alone in Tokyo and other foreign cities numerous times, but she just wasn't able to pull it off. The only thing she got right with this one was the quirkiness of modern Japanese pop culture. The plot was too loose, and the only funny scene was the one in the exercise room. This was an extremely disappointing film, particularly since it got so many rave reviews from critics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost in boredom","review":"This movie was nominated for Best Picture. You'd think that would indicate that that would be an indication of a good movie. My friend and I thought that when we went to see it live.

Instead I found this to be a depressing, non-acted film where the Japanese were made to sound stupid because Bill Murray's character simply didn't want to take the time to learn and understand anything about this marvelous place and its citizens. Here he and Johannson's character had the opportunity of a lifetime to enjoy Japan and all it has to offer and instead they were maudlin and condescending. This could have been a good film...it was not but that may be because I personally know what the characters missed. Regardless, I think the movie cast Japanese people from a less than positive vantage point which was offensive to me and I think will be to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"dull, boring","review":"I liked a few scenes, Bill Murray is a great comedian.

Save your time and money. This movie is dull, pretentious, and incredibly bad. Let's hope the Academy gives its Oscars to other films and actors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this film. I really like Bill Murray, but his female co-star said it best, just another male mid-life crisis. It attempted to depict the void that people feel when they attempt to find meaning apart from God and showed how flat we fall when we turn to drugs, sex and alcohol. The only thing that kept me watching was the hope that they would show that the characters learned something. It was a false hope. Don't waste the time and the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why escapism is a good thing.","review":"Portions of this movie are ideal for illustrating to the folks at home, how lonely and isolating business travel can actually be. The best of places, in the greatest of locations, are little more than a velvet cage when you are alone for extended periods of time.The problem is that these are experiences you look forward to ending, not bringing into your home for entertainment purposes. Clearly the finest arts form a visceral connection with our emotions, but for me please, lets not connect with my sense of boredom. Real life is brimming with opportunities for boredom and isolation. This is not a plea for pabulum, but for gosh sakes, lets actually entertain. This is like watching \\"Empire,\\" but with people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greatly overrated, tedious and psuedo art movie","review":"Two lonely people in Lost in Translation remain untouched by each other emotionally and in every other way throughout the whole movie. And the viewer has little reason or feeling to care. There is little that is interesting about them, and good cinematography cannot substitute for the lack of a plot or character development. Boring, thin and highly dissatisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Murray & Johansson in Slumberland","review":"This film was produced for those of you who may have trouble sleeping. I usually enjoy offbeat films, and liked some of Bill Murray's comedy features, but this movie has nothing to offer except a cool soundtrack and some neat shots of Tokyo. Numerous scenes of the Murray character in the hotel bar set the tone for this mostly monotonous film.If you can swallow the implausible premise that a young, hip chick in Tokyo would be attracted to the lunkish, sullen Murray, then you may enjoy this. I kept wondering when something interesting or humorous was going to happen - nadaIts a soundtrack with a half baked movie attached. The point? maybe that lonliness makes young girls pine for unattractive older men who hang out in hotel bars. This would be a good way to cleanse the palate if you've been watching too many Hollywood action films,otherwise stay away. One star for Scarlett Johansson though, - a pleasure to watch and a darn good young actress."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time....","review":"Normally, I like Bill Murray's movies but this was so excruciatingly boring I could hardly watch it.

It has an interesting cast great reveiws and coupled with what should be an absorbing plot this seems like a no brainer.sadly we were duped. the movie begins with promise there are a few rather humorous scenes in regards to the culture but that is it. all hopes for the movie to pick up are dashed when the leads finally do meet halfway trough the film. the rest of the film is simply spent folowing them through kareoke bars and strip clubs. the entire film says nothing and the only thing that kept me from falling asleep was the always exceptional acting from bill and hopes that somehow the movie would end up saying somthing of interest.i think Gregory Weinkauf of NEW TIMES describes this movie, or lack there of, the best, \\"When work this potentially satisfying remains flatly obvious, it's almost worse than being flat-out bad.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I FELT MY BODY DYING!!","review":"When the first credits began to roll at the end of this torturously long & boring movie, I fled the theatre, arms spread wide, eyes ablaze, looking for something, anything, to get my mind off of the last 100 minutes. I wanted to bathe in bleach, or perhaps gouge my eyes out just to feel clean again.40 minutes into Lost in Translation (which, by the way, is a new code word amongst friends, meaning GET ME OUT OF HERE!), I could actually FEEL my body DYING! I would have collapsed on the theatre floor if the movie had gone on much longer. No, seriously,Most scenes went on for minutes (MINUTES!) too long, and were boring in both their content and meaning when it came to the paper thin storyline and simplistic character development. I want both my money & my 100 minutes back!Unfortunately, I'm forced to give this movie at least one star. There's not an option for zero."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Movie I've Seen In Years","review":"I watched this movie for 2 reasons- first I'm a big Bill Murray fan, and second, the movie had all this hype around it with it's praise from critics and the awards it had recieved. I was bored within the first 5 minutes but I just figured that it had to get better... WRONG! Nothing happens!! It just shows Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson looking bored all the time, which makes you bored. There is no story line or point to this film. Don't buy this if you are looking to be entertained, or moved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent......what a beauty of a movie...feel good flick..","review":"This movie I watched, when no one was at home. It is a piece of art. The purity and open-honestness of Bob's & Charlottes (characters) relationship in the movie is striking, it is deep, without the complications of sex, its even more, they are there for one another when they need someone most. If you've ever just wanted a soul to listen to you and be there and hold you without sex, this movie is it. It makes you appreciate deepest friendships, and like any great movie, the ending makes the movie all worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! This is a stunningly beautiful film.","review":"First, let me say \\"Bravo Sophia Coppola!\\" She did a wonderful job with both the script and directing. Second, I think Brian Acord deserves an oscar for the cinematography. This film is visually stunning. Third, both Murray and Johansson give fantastic performances. They manage to be very funny, compassionate, human, and supremely interesting in their roles.

On the other hand, if you are honest, you may feel moved to saying that the king has no clothes on. This was an atrocious pile of meaningless pap flapping around for what seemed like an eternity in an attempt to be sensitive and deep. Watching it was the visual version of listening to teenage angst poetry.I came out of the cinema feeling robbed. I find the charge of \\"If you don't like this film then your not artistic\\" to be as pretentious as this pathetic excuse of a film.Look, look everybody the king has no clothes"},{"rating":"1","title":"Artistic BUT","review":"To answer the question 'Will YOU like THIS movie?' It all boils down to the fact that this is a Bill Murray movie. If you like Murray you WILL like this movie because Murray is Murray regardless of the production he is in.

Maybe the movie was one big ironic joke...but it doesn't read that way. I consider liking this movie a character flaw."},{"rating":"1","title":"i guess i am too dumb for this","review":"I was looking forward to this film to be released on dvd and rented it about three weeks ago. Amazingly, it still remains in me memory of certain distaste. The music by Kevin Shields was nice and so was Tokyo. The rest of the film (story, characters and cal) tried desperately to appear deep and dimensional, but it just didn't work. Maybe it was because the film was from Hollywood and I thought the colours were just too rich in contrast to the slow, boring mood in the film. Somehow i got the impression that the Coppola wanted to achieve those moods and... a story about people being meaninglessly stupid and fearing their own loneliness (although they brought it upon themselves). If true, well done fooling us!Just dont bring any expectations when watching Lost In Translation, but rather have your own voice and emphaised with the characters when you wish to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost in Translation is Just Lost","review":"To call this movie minimalist would be kind. There is about as much thought in story and character as a 30 second Coke commercial. If it wasn't for Bill Murray and his talent to improvise there would be no movie at all. The director has about as much vision as a UC film school freshman. Cut the constant establishing shots of the city and the movie would barely make sixty-minutes. She obviously doesn't have the slightest idea or interest either in fashioning an ending to her pedestrian plot. This film was obviously made the old fashion way; pure unadulterated neoptism. Rent \\"School of Rock\\" instead for a laugh a minute evening."},{"rating":"1","title":"A meatball","review":"Meatballs was better directed..even Meatballs II. I like video games. I recommend the Starfox series and Pokeman."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Awful Film! Please watch something else!!!","review":"This film is incredibly bad! The characters start out as losers and continue being losers to the end of the film. This film is horribly depressing and extremely pretentious. Why is it being lauded to the skies??? It is one of the most overrated films in history!!!Please watch something else! This awful, depressing, BORING film is not worth anyone's time."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT' EVEN BOTHER !!!!","review":"This was the most uneventful film I have ever seen. It is like a bad reality show about a man on an uneventful business trip. I cannot believe this movie got any attention at all. I think what was lost in translation was the point to the viewer. There was no point. If I had to tell you about the movie I would say it was about a man on a business trip who met a girl whos husband was on a business trip. They exchanged words now and again. He went home. The end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait..... what????","review":"This has to have been one of the worst movies I have yet to suffer through. Zero plot. The attempt to portray two lost (pun intended) individuals searching for meaning in their lives falls far short, resulting instead in a tiresome and altogether disjointed film. Finally, the movie's portrayal of Tokyo life must have left travel agents fuming."},{"rating":"1","title":"lost in filming","review":"I found this movie totally empty of plot, of interest, of good acting, and of good direction. I have no idea why it won an academy award since I found nothing in the movie that was a story or good acting or good direction. I recommend anyone who is interested to save their money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely, though hampered by some misguided humor","review":"Lost in Translation has a beautiful, dreamy feel to it. Loneliness and the universal search for identity feature as the major thematic focuses of the film.Two strangers who superficially appear to be very different (one being a older, fading actor and the other a young newlywed) share a common need for companionship and understanding.While I loved the majority of the film, much of the humor that centered around the culture shock each character experienced was misguided and too stereotype-driven to be genuinely funny - instead the jokes came off as ignorant and cliché."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alien nation","review":"One aspect I particularly appreciated was the observation of Japanese life and culture from a foreigner's perspective. Outwardly, Tokyo is a typical bustling metropolis. But with closer observation, strange and bizarre things come to light. From crazy TV talk shows, to Buddhist temples, to inexplicable politeness and reserve, the viewer is shown tidbits of Japanese society without either negative or positive commentary. Coppola allows the viewer to process the information just as the protagonists do. And these \\"alien\\" observations only add to the feeling of being lost in a foreign land.Scarlett Johansson was wonderful. She displayed such an enchanting \\"naturalness\\" thoughout the film. Her performance, in my opinion, was more impressive than Murray's."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Tightest","review":"This is top three in my book between Shawshank Redemption and True Romance. This movie is either you love it or you hate it. I loved it because it showed how you need to cherish things for how they are and remember things. Im not going to get into a philosophical rant, but this shows a relationship that doesnt need sex, and still is a strong and caring relationship with unconditional feelings (the only thing I could get from when Bill Murry is with the older chick). It also has to do with what I feel how things dont last forever. Regardless, this is an awesome movie, if you understand and love to search for meaning. If you like a straight to the point story, you wont like it. But you have to see it for yourself, dont listen to what everyone says, because people taint others thoughts and it messes up the experience. So just disregard everything I said and go rent/buy the movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Made to be bored","review":"Since this movie wasted enough of my time, here a short summary:Not only the characters were bored in Japan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Hollywood bigotry","review":"Most of y'all just don't get it (save only a few smart posters)... this movie is reeking with racism. For me, the racism was very blatant and not subtle in the least. For those that didn't pick up on it, I feel very sorry for you, you need to escape your white coccoon and face reality... just because you don't think something's offensive doesn't mean that it's not offensive. White's are not the only race who's opinions matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"i likde this movie.","review":"my brother saisd that this was a good movie so i went to see it and do you know what my brother was right!!!! i watched this movie three times and i still like it alot more than some other movies that i have seen before that i don't like as much if you like to watch movies about japan this is one of those movies. i learnt that japan is a place were lots of people to go have a nice time exccept the maine characters in this movie LOL ;). even tho you dont know my brother you should still take his advise and see this movie because it is a good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"This has got to be Bill Murray's worst film ever and amazingly he may win an Oscar for it!! It is like Alex Rodriguez winning MVP in a year he spend on the disabled list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing & bland","review":"This is movie that you'll either rate high or low with little middle ground. I had high expectations, but at the end, I felt I had gone nowhere interesting or enlightening or been entertained. I don't see any Academy Award material here. My .02 cents worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely lost on me","review":"Usually the more people who tell me I 'have' to see a movie or listen to a certain singer, the less likely I am to do it. I should have stuck with that plan! I finally saw this movie after hearing everyone call it a masterpiece and I hate how everyone is saying you are stupid if you don't 'get it'. I didn't like it (nor did my parents) and I don't consider myself (or them) stupid. Although I am stupid for listening to the reviewers. About halfway through (during one of the eighty scenes when they were singing karaoke) I picked up a book and started reading it while this movie droned on in the background. Avoid this movie at all costs, it is boring and asinine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aimless...boring....zzzzzzz","review":"I agree with another reviewer who pointed out that if the director had not been named Coppola, this movie would never have seen the light of day. This is, quite frankly, a movie in which nothing happens. When my wife and I saw it in a movie theater, we followed a stream of others out the exit about midway as the movie lumbered along. That the movie was nominated for Oscars says something about the \\"avant garde,\\" but I don't know exactly what that would be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have won for \\"most over-rated\\"","review":"As a big Bill Murray fan, and after reading all the good reviews, I lined up to see this movie the day it opened in my area. What an incredible disappointment. I can only attribute it to Sofia getting a free ride on her daddy's name (again). There should be an Oscar for \\"most over-rated\\". This would take the cake, maybe of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!!","review":"This has got to be the most boring movie I have ever watched. I just kept waiting for it to get better but it never did. It was a waste of my time and all the plots lines they could have pursued, they didn't. It was a major disappointment since I like Bill Murray and the previews for this movie made it seem a lot different than it was. Of all the people I have talked to that have seen it, I don't know a single one that actually liked it. Not a good choice Bill."},{"rating":"1","title":"jeepgirl109","review":"Lost in Translation was a waste of talent, time and money. The plot (what plot?) is horrible.

One good line amidst an entirely forgetful, boring movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great movie about nothing","review":"Like SEINFELD was advertised as a \\"show about nothing\\", this is \\"a movie about nothing\\". No matte how delicate and tender Sofia's direction was, the movie left me with no impression at al.. It dows no touch deeply Japanese culture; I've seen a lot of better movies dealing about middle-age crisis; the redeeming factor is really Bill Murray, who makes the best with hat is offered to him with the silly script.This movies seem to have achieved cult status. Alright, the girl was unhappy, Bob Harris was \\"moderately\\" unhappy,. thei love was impossible, the movie did not play it cheap, did not make them sleep together, and that was a merit. But I simply go bored wiht people singing karaoke in Japan for 90 minutes..."},{"rating":"1","title":"okay but not that great!","review":"My husband bought the DVD the minute it was on the store shelves because he said the reviews were good! We watched it and we both find it slow and dragging! The only reason I think he (Bill Murray) was nominated for the movie is because this is not his typical genre! Now I wish we just borrowed the DVD instead of spending $19.99 for it which I think will just be LOST IN STORAGE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"slow and stinky","review":"... it is terrible!

Groundhog Day, Ghostbusters, Caddyshack, Scrooged...the list goes on and on...Bill Murray is one of the great entertainers of our time, but this horrible movie will forever be a black mark by his name."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst movie EVER","review":"Just to be clear, this is not a review of this item itself, it is a review of the movie. I bought the dvd of this movie based on reviews and awards but never having seen it. I was disgusted by the pornography in this movie let alone the slowest most boring plot known to mankind. If you've seen this movie and liked it, well what can I say...but if you haven't seen it, don't buy it until you rent it first if this review hasn't turned you off. I couldn't in good conscience give my copy to anyone else so I destroyed it and threw it away. A waste of 7 bucks, but at least I could sleep at night knowing I didn't pass the smut on to someone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled by the Oscar nomination","review":"It's unbelievable that this movie had an Oscar nomination. It has no plot and wanders aimlessly. I kept watching because I was stunned that it could be so bad and was wondering how they would pull it together at the end. When it did mercifully end, they didn't pull it together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very good for insomniacs","review":"I actually farted during this film and enjoyed the odor more that the actual movie..a true story."},{"rating":"1","title":"ballot stuffing","review":"very interesting to see the \\"fellow\\" from seattle writing a dozen 5 star reviews. Aside from seriously lacking a life, it is probably similiar to the ballot stuffing that got this garbage an Oscar nomination. Scary how a few fanatics can manipulate the process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Boring, Boring...","review":"As much as I like Bill Murray, I could not keep my attention focused on this movie. I couldn't even stay awake the first time, and had to keep munching popcorn to make it all the way through the second time. I watched it the second time to make sure I hadn't overlooked or missed something. Fact is, there's nothing to overlook or miss. The only interesting thing was the maze of lights and electronics shown in downtown Tokyo. Your money is better spent on a travelog of Japan than on this meaningless, go nowhere movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost in Translation - that's for sure","review":"I am a big Bill Murray fan, but even that could not help me get through this movie. I kept waiting for the movie to \\"start\\" but it never did. And seeing that it is up for an Academy Award, I have to agree with those previous reviewers who say it's only because of Soffia Coppola's name. I thought this movie was boring, slow moving and it took 1 1/2 hours when it could have taken 30 minutes (if that) to get the point across."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plotless and boring","review":"This is by far one of the most plotless and boring movies I've ever seen. I was simply unable to find a point. After all the hype surrounding this \\"movie,\\" I was, needless to say, very disappointed. The fact that Sophia won an Oscar for this waste of film is really quite pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have a suggestion for those two characters with insomnia -","review":"THEY SHOULD WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!Actually, it didn't put me to sleep - parts of the soundtrack were too noisy, and I was too hyped by my SHOCK that this mediocre movie has received such a plethora of critical praise.Like Johanssen's character, I did chuckle at most of what Murray said. But I was almost immediately struck by the patronizing attitude of the movie toward people of another culture, and I'm a middle-of-the-road type person, not an extreme PC type.There is nothing at all special about this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost in the Movie...!","review":"This movie completely escapes me. I read all the reviews before seeing it, and was expecting to be pleasantly surprised.At the end, all I could see was a couple of lost souls wandering around tokyo, looking lost themselves. If the movie was \\"intelligent\\", I certainly missed it.Neither of the actors possessed any emotional latitude. They just wandered thru the movie lost themselves.After this movie ended, I caught the last 1/2 of the \\"Last Samurai\\". At least this movie did not pretend to be something else, and what you saw was what you got.Don't waste your time on \\"lost in translation\\" or you'll be lost yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"I FELT MY BODY DYING!","review":"When the first credits began to roll at the end of this torturously long & boring movie, I fled the theatre, arms spread wide, eyes ablaze, looking for something, anything, to get my mind off of the last 100 minutes. I wanted to bathe in bleach, or perhaps gouge my eyes out just to feel clean again.40 minutes into Lost in Translation (which, by the way, is a new code word amongst friends, meaning GET ME OUT OF HERE!), I could actually FEEL my body DYING! I would have collapsed on the theatre floor if the movie had gone on much longer. No, seriously,Most scenes went on for minutes (MINUTES!) too long, and were boring in both their content and meaning when it came to the paper thin story line and simplistic character development. I want both my money & my 100 minutes back, Sophie!Unfortunately, I'm forced to give this movie at least one star. There's not an option for zero."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly boring","review":"While I see the adulation here for \\"a masterpiece\\" and \\"a movie that makes you think\\", all I saw was two people feeling sorry for themselves and comisserating in Tokyo. Let me break down the plot for you - there is no plot. The whole thing is like a Seinfeld episode without humor.I think that all of the excitement over this movie was due to the director's last name. If she were Sophia Kent or Sophia Adams or anything besides Sophia Coppolla, this film would've never been made. It's got her name attached and so people think it must be great. They drum up some intellectual mumbo-jumbo about how meaningful the whole thing is and then a bunch of morons jump on the bandwagon, not wanting to be left behind and thought of as unsophisticated.Save yourself two hours of your life and do something - anything - besides watching this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disaster","review":"I hated this movie so much (I don't usually use that word) that I signed up on Amazon to warn people about it. I enjoy many off beat movies - it is not that I don't appreciate slow artistic movies (I love Paris Texas for example), it's just that this movie is plain awful. Murray's character is despicably disrespectful to the Japanese culture - I ended up really disliking him, and therefore the girl he met (as she liked him). The movie is devoid of any depth - it is shallow, superficial and boring. The movie is about boredom, I suppose, and as far as that is concerned the best it manages is to subject you to some. The film is not even shot in an interesting manner. If I made this movie, I would beg for it not to be released (at least not under my name) and I would seek a new profession. Yes, I know who the director was. Don't even watch it out of morbid curiousity, it sucks. The long positive reviews above are utterly absurd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly hype","review":"I expected great things of this movie but unfortunately, it did not live up to its hype. It was a one-note film, full of angst, and had no plot.I had read that there were some funny parts, but they must have been cut out of the version I had!And Bill Murray, nominated for a best-actor award...all he did was mope around with a long face and bassett-hound eyes!What a depressing, dull movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrid","review":"Two rich and spoiled brats, one old the other young, complain about how horrible life is.

If you like dull moronicdialog with no substance, by all means, see it or buyit. Why the Bob character has fleeting relationships withwomen other than the one he is in love with is anyone'sguess. But, then again, by the end of the movie, you willbe asking yourself \\"who cares?\\". If you want to see amovie about Japanese culture, rent an international filmwith subtitles. The number of stars I pick for a moviereflects how many times I would like to see it. I couldn'tsit through this movie again. It is a 1 star.P.S. Watch the paper on the straw in the bar scene ;-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many idiots in this word","review":"This must be one of those films that people wasted their money watching and then wanting others to do the same. So they rated this boring movie high so others may want to see it and waste their money also. How sad. If people can really say they can identify with this movie, they must be really lonely and living a boring life. If wandering around a city looking out the window and looking bored is great acting, then this would be a great film."},{"rating":"1","title":"a romatic comedy without romance and without comedy","review":"Its an art film made with the best of intentions: \\"let's through out all the rules and make something totally different.\\" Well they did, and the result is a romatic comedy without romance and without comedy. And the worst part is the missed opportunity, for Johansson and Murray do have chemistry, but it is smothered by pretentious adolescent symbolism. This movie is tedious, irritating, banal, with sparks of brilliance that never last long and leave the viewer frustrated and worst: bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"simply writing this to add to the one star reviews and offset a lengthy 5 star review.

Plus, it bugs me that I used a free rental to watch this ode to paint drying on film.I just wish the critics and the Oscar judges would be as honest as I am about this film. All the snappy dialog in the world can't hide the fact that this film GOES ABSOLUTELY NOWHERE. Why don't they just create a \\"let's give Bill Murray an Oscar award for being such a swell guy\\" Oscar category and be done with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"My date fell asleep","review":"And I wasn't far behind.

Imagine that."},{"rating":"1","title":"For those who think they're smarter than everyone else","review":"I've noticed reading these reviews that people who love this movie tend to knock those that don't because they think we wanted \\"explosions\\", \\"jokes about passing gas\\" or other raunchy comedy scenes. Please don't be fooled. This is not an \\"art\\" movie. It's not that Lost in Translation is boring--it's that it has no soul. Coppola does nothing to make the audience care about the charachters, or care about the plot. Those of you criticizing people who didn't like it need to get off your high horses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting idea, but racist","review":"People visiting cultures unfamiliar to them as well as being adrift in their own lives in an interesting premise. That they find each other and connect may provide a satisfying movie.But I could just not get over the constant racism of the movie: it may be funny at some level for Bill Murray's character to be confused by a Japanese speaking director in Japan, but the movie seems to imply that these Japanese are just weird and insensitive. And Charlotte's youthful Japanese buddies are so stereotyped that they are insulting to all Japanese. Just consider the impact if instead of Japan, the characters were placed in Harlem and the film went out of it way to stereotype and insult the people who live there."},{"rating":"1","title":"I will never get those two hours back","review":"I can easily see why Bill Murray was nominated for an Oscar. His performance was exceptional. However, it was not enough to save one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. It was slow, plotless, and had a pointless ending. As a character study it is mildly enjoyable, but only if you can stay awake.Blech!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy script, good acting and camera work","review":"What a waste of time. If it wasn't for decent acting and cinematography I would have enjoyed root canal better. Come on, those that write and direct should be judged on their own merits, not just because of who they are related to. Having been in Japan before I can attest that it is a \\"foreign\\" place for us Westerners but a better script could have made this a more endurable movie. If you have time to burn, see this flick. If on the other hand your time is valuable, see a movie written and directed by proven talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"all about hype!","review":"I think that if this film was done by anyone else, other than another Coppola, that it wouldn't have received very much attention. This film is mildly entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreary Days and Starry Nights","review":"This is a documentary about Japanese night life contrasted by some day-light tourist scenes.

E-bay to the rescue!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not deserving of its one Oscar","review":"The fact that this film won one Oscar at last Sunday's Academy Awards is an outrage. Pure nepotism was at work. Sofia Coppola did not look genuinely happy to be at the Academy Awards. She only got the Oscar because of her last name. In her acceptance speech, she thanked some people who helped her to continue writing the script for \\"Lost in Translation\\" after 12 pages. You can bet that the script is only a little bit longer than 12 pages.Sean Penn won an Oscar for \\"Best Actor\\". Thank God that Bill Murray didn't win. Penn deserved that Oscar. Murray didn't deserve the Oscar nomination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated!!!","review":"I just saw Lost in Translation on DVD. This movie defines the word \\"overrated\\". What a boring movie! I actually dosed off for a few minutes. I went back to see what I missed. It didn't matter. Boring characters, boring script, boring movie!!! I can't believe it was nominated for best picture while good films were passed over. I can't see how anyone can call this a great movie, unless understated and boring is now considered greatness. I write screenplays and one of the cardinal rules of screenwriting is \\"don't bore your audience\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, very dull","review":"It is a general rule of ours that if nothing happens in the first thirty minutes of a movie, nothing is going to happen. Having read several reviews of this one, and having a long-time liking for Bill Murray, I forced myself to watch it through to the bitter end. It was no exception to the thirty minute rule.I can certainly relate to being stuck in a strange city with nothing to do, but the concept really runs dry pretty quickly. There are a couple of redeeming points about the film - it's interesting as a travelogue, the portraits of vapid people are fairly good - but all in all, it's just plain dull, dull, dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humane","review":"Watch it. If you have just graduated from a small highly competitive liberal arts college and you do not know what to do with your life, you will cry."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice travelogue","review":"Nice footage of modern Tokyo and Kyoto. And yes, it is hard to sleep when you first get to Japan from the U.S. because of the time difference, but overall, vacation footage,as far as I can tell. Bill Murray being Bill Murray. How hard is that? Good looking movie. A little naive regarding the Japanese people. Also, yes I would have liked to know what was said at the end, but that doesn't make it Academy Award material in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Lost In Interpretation","review":"The title seemed to be the best in this movie, they showed Tokyo very nice but I did not want to watch any quide. The whole story very poor and disappointing and very far away from a comedy. Nothing could really make you laugh in the movie and nobody seemed happy. It would be ok if that was an award for a quide to Japan as a documetary."},{"rating":"1","title":"REALLY Lost in Translation","review":"The cinematography is excellent and, of course, Scarlett Johansson is wonderful to look at. Even Bill Murray is pretty believable as a washed up actor. But that's as much praise as I can muster. If this movie had a script at all, the dialogue couldn't have been anything more than a weak suggestion. It seemed as though Sophia Coppola just showed the actors her story board and told them to go improvise. For all the Oscar buzz it received, \\"Lost in Translation\\" is the 2003 version of a \\"Blair Witch Project\\" disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost in Meaning","review":"With all the praise that this movie garnered,I came away feeling as empty as the characters.I wondered why this movie did not explore more of the dynamics between Japanese/foreigner?The characters come together only out of lonely circumstances,and given any other place,would more than likely not be bothered knowing each other.Hanging out together in a different city does not make one a true friend,let alone soul mate.Sorry Sophia,this movie doesn't cut it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"It is a strange character study of two people lost in a strange land. In fact, it is two people sharing their own private desperation and depression. If you want to stay in a good mood, pass on this one. If you like to be \\"Lost in Translation\\" then have a nice time. For me, it was a waste of time and I was not the least bit impressed. There are much better films out there, and I can't understand all the hype."},{"rating":"2","title":"truly great movie","review":"You have to like quiet movies to love this one but it's a masterpiece. The cinematography in Japan alone is worth the price of admission but Bill Murray has never been better-- no not even in Groundhogs Day, another first rate film-- and his young co-star is equally wonderful. It's a tender true story of what can happen when two strangers connect in an unlikely place and time, an improbable and unconsummated love story with a great mysterious ending. (what does he whisper to her?) Beautiful to watch. Must see."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie got \\"LOST IN TRANSLATION\\"","review":"I am a huge fan of Bill Murray and this was by far the worst movie that I have ever seen. After all the awards that this movie won I thought it would be worth watching. I could not have been more wrong. I actually watched the whole movie but that was only because I thought that at any time the movie would start to make sense - it does not happen! Do not waste your money like I did.

I just wish I could take mine back to the store for a full refund!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn...","review":"Possibly the most overrated film of this or any era (except maybe \\"Gone with the Wind\\"). It's called pacing Sofia, you might want to look into it, since \\"Virgin Suicides\\" is just as dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I kept waiting for the movie to begin... and then it ended. In the meantime I had to endure a tiresome barrage of \\"isn't Japan weird,\\" pseudo-quirky, stereotypical tripe. Add to this the fact that I'm supposed to be empathizing with the two lead characters, both of whom are your average, everyday wealthy globetrotters, and the sum is a movie that I could barely sit through. There wasn't even any nudity relief.Makes me wonder what the big reviewers would have said if the director didn't have a famous last name. Or what would have been said if the movie had given a different ethnic group the same belittling treatment."},{"rating":"1","title":"lost in the doldrums","review":"All I have to say is, if you want a movie to put you to sleep, this is definitely IT! This film is perfect for the insomniac looking for a way to sleep without the aid of sleeping pills! One of THE most boring movies in the past 10 years which somehow was able to receive quite a few academy award nominations. I don't recommend this movie. It's sad because I think Bill Murray is such a talented comedic actor. He has been so entertaining in most of his other films, just not this one. There is only 1 laughable scene, where he is in the midst of making a commercial. The dialogue between Bill and his Japanese director is priceless. However, that scene alone is not worth the time it takes to filter through this boring story line. Save your time and energy and see any number of his other movies instead. You'll be happy that you didn't waste your time sitting through lost in the doldrums."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie \\"lost\\" me.","review":"I watched this after the Oscars and I can see why Sofia won, however it's not my cup of tea.

This trite, pointless attempt at entertainment felt like it went on forever.I've tried to figure out how Bill Murray could have gotten himself involved in a project like this. My conclusion: he lost a bet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"1 hr and 42 mins lost in translation","review":"The only good thing about this film was that the title is very fitting, I was definitely lost. I have nothing against artistic films, but they need to have some kind of point. Before you waste your money buying/renting this movie go to your local bar and people watch for a couple of hours. If you find this enjoyable this movie is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had Sofia Coppola anything to tell?","review":"Don't expect a comedy! The only feeling that this film caused me was claustrophobia. One wanted to flee a screen where the characters are incapables to communicate between themselves; where the scenes (all of them we can easily do without) follow one another any old how. We see two hollows persons. Nothing else. There is not even friendship, rebelliousness or tenderness. That's why I didn't feel neither compassion nor interest.Sofia Coppola had budget but not a plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"See Kingpin instead.....","review":"If your really a fan of Bill Murray, avoid this snoozefest at all costs! I watched it based on the critics \\"glowing\\" reviews, and the fact that Bill Murray was nominated for an oscar. I should have known better, then to trust those artsie critic's tastes.If you want to see Bill Murray in a truly oscar-caliber role, then go see him as Ernie \\"Big Ern\\" McCracken in Kingpin. He just gets funnier and funnier the more you see it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"amazingly bad","review":"The movie was just terrible and boring but reading the reviews on Amazon almost made it worthwhile! After watching this, I was so amazed at how this 'acclaimed' film could be such a bomb that I was dying to see some comments by others who didn't \\"get it.\\" I really got a kick out of some of the hilarious reviews. Totally agree with whoever said that following almost any tourist around Tokyo for a few days with a camcorder would be as good as this. Also laughed at the guy who said he considered liking this film a character flaw! I rented this movie and \\"Love Actually\\" at the same time and they couldn't have been more opposite: Lost In Translation: dull, pointless, pretentious. Love Actually: entertaining, upbeat, well-written. Gotta say I love this website."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my Saturday night back!","review":"If you are a pseudo-intellectual, this is your film. You will be wowed by the lack of plot, the paper-thin character development, and the bored, vacant expressions on the characters' faces, which you will no doubt ascribe to their deep understanding of the timeless misery of the human experience.But if you are like me and just want to enjoy a movie without hollow pretense, save your money. At least I rented this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star may be a little high","review":"A boring movie about two boring people married to more boring spouses. Whats up with Japan's nightlife?!

While I agree that Bill Murray did an amazing acting job, overall, this movie rates a D- from me. Utterly underwhelming, I kept waiting to connect with each of the characters. It never happened. I am still unimpressed with Sofia Coppola's directing talents, tho I can see that there is definately potential. Ultimately, \\"who cares?\\" was the only feeling with which I was left.A real disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do it unless..","review":"Do not watch this movie unless: 1. You adore Bill Murray's goofy face trying to act jaded but looking, well, just goofy 2. You love watching long scenes of people looking out windows, up at ceilings, and into space 3. You crave movies that go nowhere and get there very slowly 4. You enjoy seeing the Japanese made to look small, silly, fawning, and extremely uncool. This movie has some laughs, at the expense of the Japanese. One sight gag is that Murray looms over the Japanese in an elevator. His supercilious glances downward say it all: He is the cool, tall American and they are funny little foreign people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even a vodka tonic","review":"Could make this movie interesting.

Where's the story?","review":"To cut to the chase, why wasn't the script written so Bill Murray was single, and Scarlett Johansson's husband was cheating on her, and the two fell in love? This could have been a terrific love story. On a side note, (A) Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson had chemistry, (B) the directing was very good, and (C) Scarlett Johansson is very beautiful and a wonderful actress."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't expect to be spoon-fed the theme.","review":"What an excellent movie! If you had any interest in \\"Garden State\\" or \\"Rushmore\\" then you will really be able to crawl into this movie. And crawl you must. Sorry, no express trolley to the underlying theme, or spoon feeding of plot here.Bill Murray has always been an interesting choice to star in movies that don't sport a hard-core comedy theme, but he is seemless in this movie.I wish I had more time to work on this review (my apologies, as the movie truly deserves serious accolades) but again, if you had any interest in either of the two movies above, then you should have no problem grooving to this slow-burn beat. (Oh, and the music is fantastic!! Again think Garden State / Rushmore)Kudos Bill."},{"rating":"2","title":"TRANSCENDS MERE WORDS - INDESCRIBABLE","review":"I'm still speechless from this film, so I won't begin to attempt to put into words the emotion and awe that it will inspire in all but the coldest of hearts. A very moving experience and the totally unique and original depiction of a relationship that is elevetated high above the mundane into something spritual. But there is so much more here. To describe this movie as merely a great film is to call the Mona Lisa a pretty good painting. This is not a mere film, this is a jewel, a treasure, and words can't begin to describe it so I will stop trying - One must just see it. It will speak for itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a character study, folks....","review":"It's a character study, and a great one, the kind they used to make in the 70's (like her dad did)... similar to The Last Detail, The Conversation, Five Easy Pieces, etc. Loved the shots of Japan, the acting, the writing, the pacing, the mystery at the end - everything about it. And it has a lot of subtle humor to it. Sophia's awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"There is nothing quite like Lost In Translation","review":"Certainly this isn't a perfect film... but then again neither is life, so that just may be the point of this film!Many people don't like the pace, (You speed junkies!) and I suppose some people fine the attraction between Bill and Scarlet a tad unbelievable, but I found this film to be just the right thing to watch, basically whenever I want!I ain't gonna give out any secrets, but the ending is just perfect and so touching that it really makes the film! Funny thing is that I don't even think that scene was in the original script!Also, the whole sequence in Kioto is spot on... and shouldn't be missed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost everyone should be able to take something from this .","review":"'Wow' is all I can say ... Sophia Coppola has just made up for ruining Godfather III.This is just a wonderfully simple movie about the idea that some of the most touching moments in your life may be some of the briefest.Coppola also does a terrific job of conveying that disconnected feeling that you can get when you travel to another country. As if the world is still moving, but you're no longer a part of it, you're wandering around outside of it all.I really could go on for an hour about all the ideas that Coppola, very subtly, pushes out there for her audience to think about. What really impresses me though is that she managed to convey all of these themes without beating the audience (i.e. - me) over the head. She really leaves A LOT out there for people to discover themselves. I find that refreshing.This is an intelligent movie that really is a must-see. It's every bit as good as it was hyped up to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I please have my 2 hours back???","review":"I can sum up the entire movie in one word \\"disappointing.\\" I was so excited about seeing another Bill Murray movie, and rented the DVD the day it came out. I really can't think of a slower movie that seemed to lead me nowhere. And it took what seemed like an eternity to get there. As much as I want to like this movie, I must say \\"STAY AWAY\\". Don't do it to yourself. Just read the comments from the guy who posted \\"Lonely Days, Lonely Nights\\". That's all you need to know. You can thank me now."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL, BORING movie; Go see Memoirs of a Geisha instead","review":"This is an awful, boring movie. Sofia Coppola shames her family name with this piece of shoddy directing (aka garbage). This film is racist and plotless and UGLY as HELL. The acting of Murray and Johansson is zombie like. This is not acting; it's sleepwalking. Anyone can do it.For a film that respects Japanese people and culture and looks gorgeous to boot and has a real plot and MUCH BETTER acting, go see Memoirs of a Geisha."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the 'Zero' star? One of the WORST movies of all time.","review":"Arguably Bill Murray's worst movie. And no doubt, one of Hollywood's worst. An ABSOLUTE dud. PLEASE, don't waste your money. If you really want to see it, borrow it from your brother in law. This movie seriously was 'Lost' in translation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Middle-Aged Man's Fantasy Movie","review":"This is every middle-aged man's fantasy. A hot young chick falling for a much older man. It is obvious why the older guy would be interested, but why would the younger woman be interested in the older man? The movie fell short on giving any reasonable explanation as to why the young woman would be interested in the older man. The young woman was protrayed as a Yale graduate who is missing intellectual stimulation in her marriage and life. Yet in the relationship she had with the older man, there still was no intellectual stimulating conversations between them, which made the relationship fake and unbelievable. Ask \\"What can the older man offer that the young woman can not get with her younger friends or husband?\\" This movie does not satisfactorily answer that question."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your Money","review":"Save your money for another Bill Murray movie later on.I bought this movie mostly because Bill Murray is always funny.WRONG MOVE.

Don't waste your time with this Bill Murray flick, go watch Groundhog Day again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Film Ever.","review":"No need for a review. Watch it for yourself and be goaded into such extreme boredom that you may choose to hang yourself rather than endure any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feel asleep a million times watching it.","review":"I tried to watch Lost in Translation with my family and they thought it was so boring. I was happy because now I know I'm not crazy. We could only bare 30 minutes of it before fast-forwarding to the climax of the movie where absolutely nothing happens. People love this movie though. And real people too, like friends of my parents and adults who have college degrees. Anyway, if you've never seen it- don't rent it. I thought the movie Pluto Nash or \\"Black Night\\" starring Martin Lawrence was better. I guess Lost in Translation is supposed to be like real life (Depending on whether or not you're an emo nerd), but people don't pay to see movies like real life. They want to escape the mediocrity of their boring life and see planes firing missles at each other and a tarantula devoruing something living. Why would I want to spend two hours watching someone else's boring life? I don't know. People who like the movie Lost in Translation know."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was the point?","review":"I was surprised to see Bill Murray take this role, yes he did an awesome job acting, but what was the point.

I frankly fail to see what anyone would find entertaining or funny about this movie. Although I usually like Bill Murray's films, this one is a big loser. Even worse is the direction.

Bill Murray was good playing Bill Murray. I was so happy he did not win the Oscar. I respect Bill Murray for Caddyshack, Groundhog's Day, and Rushmore, but this movie did not do it for me.

Character rather than plot- driven, Bill Murray and Scarlett Johanssen convey with expression and gestures the emotions of sadness, despair, and attraction beautifully. The exotic setting and sparse dialogue render this a beautiful film. If you are looking for dialogue that tells you what to think and what the characters are thinking, this film is not for you. If you are a thinking man, however, this film will deeply move you. Well done, Sofia Coppola. I hope to see more from both her and these wonderful stars. The best film of 2003."},{"rating":"1","title":"If \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" was made into a movie...","review":"This film has a lot of similarities with Ernest Hemingway's \\"The Sun Also Rises\\".

Two lifeless egotists, while suspended in sterile environment, happen to drift past each other and briefly develop an appearance of human relationship, then part ways and continue drifting aimlessly in that lukewarm formaldehyde of a movie. It was nearly as memorable and engaging as watching the movement of two floaters in a broken toilet. The fact that the toilet is very expensive and is located in a foreign country doesn't change the nature of what it is you're looking at.Bring this plot to a studio and unless your last name is Coppola you'll be lucky if you can pitch it to the security guard without being slapped silly. The photography was great, though. It had an expensive look and feel, perhaps like everything else in the author's uneventful life inside that ivory tower of hers."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't just want my money back; I wanted revenge.","review":"My wife and I saw this movie in the theater. While the movie was only 102 minutes long, it seemed more like 102 hours. When the movie ended I was so angry that I didn't just want my money back, I wanted revenge.

It was so boring that quite a few people in the theatre got up and left in the middle of the movie. I considered it a challenge to see if I could actually sit through the entire thing.

The acting was excellent, but everything else about the movie dragged."},{"rating":"1","title":"a nice helping of pre-chewed pabulum for middle-america...","review":"I don't get you people. Just because the movie is composed of arduously long shots with little dialogue- that don't make it compelling cinema. Just because the characters are 'alienated' don't make them interesting. Just because there's a happenin' soundtrack don't make it worthwhile. And just because Ms. Johansson looks nice in panties and can stub her toe believably- that don't make her talented. And just because the boom-mike falls into frame after frame, that don't make it arty, or relevant... And while I'm at it, Just because someone studied philosophy (which is a joke anyway) or dabbles in flower-arranging or is stuck in a dead-end marriage- that don't make her deep....There is no discernable script, or plot, or substance to this abortion. It's not that I hated it- there's nothing to hate. It's just a spoilt rich girl's painfully contrived delusions about herself and her place in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uneventful love story","review":"I don't get this movie. I guess it's supposed to be two people kind of sort of falling in love, but never really kissing or making a booty call. I don't think it's realistic. But maybe the people who like it have experienced relationships like that. Either way, I was bored. The visuals of Japan are great and as realistic as can be. It shows how strange modern day Japanse culture feels to the American. Overall, I found it barely watchable. I'd rather sit through XXX or Too fast, too furious. Never seen either one, but I'm sure at least something happens in them. This movie wanted to be subtle like \\"Tennenbaums\\" or \\"Rushmore.\\" All your artsy friends in the graphic design class will probably highly reccomend this movie, but I reccomend that you think twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't rate lower than a 1","review":"Took 20hours to download!

BM is sublime as the jaded middle aged American film star on assignment abroad; in a role he was born to play. Scarlett Johansson is equally convincing as the sensitive and lonely newlywed whose chance meeting with Murray in Tokyo morphs into an unlikely search for love and life's meaning. Old and new Japan as experienced by both outsiders, its glitz and tradition, holds an increasingly beguiling fascination that becomes an interesting movie theme in itself. The Zen like soundtrack: an eclectic mix of western and oriental song and sound simply magnifies the disjuncture banality and beauty of modern urban Japan. Without doubt repeat viewing of LIT is a pleasure. The DVD I bought (in China) has the soundtrack as an extra.

Definitely a 5-star movie. BUT, I HATED the shameless advertising on the DVD. Much to my shock, after plunking down the money here to get the DVD, I put it in my machine and it automatically starts up with streams and streams of advertising for coming attractions,etc. Hitting the Menu or Jump buttons doesn't work! They've disabled it in this portion of the DVD! All you can do is do a forward scan... it still takes close to 10 minutes to get to the movie!!! Each time you play it! This is disgusting and shameless. No one wants to pay close to 20 bucks for a movie and have to sit through these mandatory commercials. I'll never buy a DVD from this producer again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nepotism At Its Worst","review":"Unfortunately, this movie feels like an end-of-the-semester project a film student makes in order to graduate. It tries so hard to be something, that it actually ends up being nothing. Sofia probably had a lot of things to say about lonliness and being a stranger in a strange land, but for some reason, she thought she didn't have to actually have her characters do or say anything. Apparently we'll 'get it' through osmosis. There are endless shots of Bill and Scarlett staring out of windows, sitting in silence or doing things that add nothing to the movie (hitting a golf shot, for instance). These \\"figure it out for yourself because I'm too busy being an artist\\" scenes might have worked if these characters had been fleshed out to any degree. Instead, we watch two morose human beings walk around for 2 slow, tedious, uninteresting, maddening, and frustrating hours. There is one word why this film saw the light of day: Coppola."},{"rating":"1","title":"lost in reality","review":"The characters in this movie have no character. They sit around looking miserable, staring into space, and one wonders why. Is it because they are in a foreign country? Do they realize that there are curtural activies in Tokyo? Instead they worry about their hormones. Murray is old enough to know better. He gripes to the sweet young thing he has befriended that his wife does not understand him; even though she is a graduate of Yale and married for 2 years, she can commiserate with him. Sure. He proves his virility by a drunken romp in the sack with a redhead that he meets in a bar. In Japan, English is a second language, particularly amoung the younger set, but you wouldn't know it; which is ridiculous; even the translator has problems expressing herself in English. The movie is lost in translation alright, in fact it is lost period. I rented it for 3 bucks. I should get a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Sofia Coppola films.","review":"I love to watch anything Sofia Coppola produces. She just has a unique view of love and friendship.

I went to see this movie with HIGH expectations, based on the HIGH amount of hype (and of course, to see Bill Murray, who rarely missteps in even the most miserable product), and went away scratching my head wondering why everyone is praising this film as if it's the second coming of Kane.Lost in Translation is deadly dull, it overdoes the typical Japanese stereotypes, and it completely squanders the talents of Murray as well as Scarlett Johansson. Apparently Coppola had to really chase after Murray to get him to do this film. He should have shut off his phone.Lost in Translation comes off as a big-budget student film.The movie earns its single star only for Murray's Joey Bishop imitation.Save yourself some time and just fast-forward to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"existential blah","review":"I have no idea what about this movie has garnered it so much hype. As many have said before-- boring characters. I didn't ever see this relationship develop. It's just boring to watch characters who are so pathetically lost in one of the most interesting cities in the world. Oh, poor, rich, white me. Please. That leads me to the racism of the the backdrop of Japanese characters. Never developed as characters and always the butt of the joke. This is a problem. A great antidote to culture shock is to connect with people in the country you are in. You know, connect with one another as human beings.

I can only guess they like the Coppola name."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm lost","review":"I'll be the first to admit I'm not the most astute film reviewer in the world, and I don't appreciate all the deep meanings behind a movie, but would someone please tell me what the fuss was about this film?Two lonely people meet in Tokyo, both suffering from a lack of sleep and some serious culture shock. They meet, hang out, almost have an affair, and ...?I guess I'm a dumb American, but what's the point? OK, I'll concede a couple of scenes were a little funny, but yikes, the movie as a whole was a snoozer. (...)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost in Pretentiousness","review":"If you're the type that wants to show how cool you are, you'll probably love this movie, but if you're looking for something authentic, you won't find it here. A vanity project of the worst kind, one that's pointless. I really wanted to enjoy this.. but I couldn't, due to the lack of actual quality that is there. It's poorly written and directed, and manages to take an interesting premise and flush it right down the toilet."},{"rating":"1","title":"To be kind: overrated","review":"To be truthful, boring and insufferable. The Academy was asleep when it nominated this flick for awards, and dead on its feet to grant one. There is nothing likeable about the characters and Bill Murray is totally wasted as a has-been actor making a commercial in Japan. Johannsen is cardboard as the largely ignored wife of a hot photographer. Murray is rich and famous, but unhappy: well, he cheats on his wife! Johannssen, unlike many REALLY unhappy and abused wives could easily leave but doesn't. Sorry, Hollywood, people with REAL lives and REAL problems aren't going to be entertained by rich people who have it all but sit around complaining about how shallow their lives are. Rent Bill Murray's classic \\"Stripes\\" instead and have some real fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"bored and red eyed","review":"WOW is the only way I can start..... Bad, Boring, Sleep Inducing, dribble. Being a film nut who's taste runs to independent and foriegn films what a bummer to discover this total waste of time. To show you how much I was looking forward to watching this film I not only purchased from Amazon I could not wait for it to arrive and bought a another at Barnes and Noble. So now I have two bookends of this boring film. The shocking part is that I am a fan of Bill Murray along with being an Italian and always pulling for a fellow Italian such as Sophia Coppola. There is nothing that I can say other than if you have a problem sleeping at night just flip this dvd in and I can assure you in no time at all you will be in dream land except for the occasional nightmare of this film playing in your head over and over and over and over.

There was so much potential for a great show: Bill in Japan, not understanding a word being said to him. Instead there were numerous blown opportunities to captivate the audience, and some of the lamest conversations that seem like they will never end. I don't know why there is so much hype about it, its a pictural version of a sleeping pill, with the most enteresting thing being some of the beautiful scenes of Tokyo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Face it, this movie STINKS","review":"Anyone who gave this more than 3 stars has never seen a well thought out, intellectual film. There is nothing interesting or engaging about this film, except that Bill Murray does a good job acting. But he was much better in some of his other films. People who give this film 4 or 5 stars are the type of people who think Red Lobster is fine dining because all they ever eat is Filet O'Fish.

I have always been a Bill Murray fan. He's made many funny movies, many classics. Here I was expecting some comedy, maybe a little drama even. Two Words, Forget it. It is almost as if this movie were an actual attempt to deliberately avoid being entertaining. Its much like I would imagine sitting in a padded room for two hours. One thing this movie is chock full of, Melancholia. Perhaps that would have been a better title. I realize now the title \\"Lost in Translation\\" isn't referring to Bill Murray being in Japan at all, but rather the great divide between pretentious Hollywood elites and the average moviegoer...Do not even watch this movie to see why other people hate it, its so bad.. p.s. it doesn't really deserve a star but I must give it one to post this review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look at the cover","review":"I watched the movie and was dissappointed.

I wish people would really say what they really thought about this film just to stop impressing their friends and convincing people of how \\"deep\\" they are to understand a film like this. Even as one who enjoys abstract thought and film, I totally hated this movie. There wasn't a plot and it reminds me of those types of movies that those people who were just hurt in a relationship want to make to express their undying sadness and make their ex's seem like total uncaring arschlocher. I also don't understand why every premis to a movie or story has to be based on love. It's not a very intersting subject, and it's not that I can't relate, I just find it a boring subject. I would give this film two stars, because the colors and the the cinemetography weren't bad at all, but someone else said it best first \\"Good frames won't save bad paintings.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"what?","review":"This is the worst movie I have ever seen. Completely lacking any structural plot, this film did not even make sense. The characters were bland, the kareoke singing was nearly intolerable...

Overrated. I do like movies that delve in the human condition. But this movie was missing something. What it did was identify the problem but it did not attempt to solve the problem. That can work with some stories but not this one. Even the so called fun shots were really boring. The photography was good. The acting was on target. And the story had potential. This movie is a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Over hyped.Travelogue of Japan","review":"I think that this movie is one of the biggest rip offs, I have seen in a long time.

I guess this movie was made on P. T. Barnum's assertion! What a bomb!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"yawn during it, can't-live-without after it.","review":"This is kind of movie that you yawn during it, but can't live without after you finish the journey. It's all about loneliness. General americans cannot understand the deepest loneliness. You think lonely is when you are alone in the house and talking to yourself? No, the deepest loneliness is when you are in a crowd and no one talks to you, no one touches you, and even no one looks at you. They are all occupied by their business and have no slightest interest in you. The loneliness is even deepened when the environment surround you are so beautiful, and you have no one to share with. When I watched the DVD alone in my apartment and had a couple laugh, I realized I made the right choice moving to the States, because I was there. I am too familiar with the loneliness. As such, I don't think this film will have any luck when release in Asia, because the film is just about the daily life of people there."},{"rating":"2","title":"some will enjoy, others may dose off","review":"I watched this with my fiance and a group of friends. While the film generated quite a few laughs, the general consensus was that it started off OK and dragged on at the end. I felt differently. I enjoyed the odd role played by Bill Murray and appreciated the performance of Scarlett Johannson. I suppose I also liked the film's international setting in Japan. The various scense from in and around Tokyo made for interesting viewing. I'm guessing that most people will rate this a 2 or 3, but for me it was a 3.5 or 4."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of the hype","review":"A near miss that has been sold with loads of hype. Bill Murray does some good work but it is really nothing that he has not done before. The depictions of some of the characters have a meanness to them that will put me off from watching it again let alone owning a copy of it. I feel that a second viewing would not be entertaining. R.E. and his peers must must have seen some other cut of this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What writing?","review":"Best Original Screenplay? Give me a break! They just want to give an award for this film because of Francis Ford Coppola. Lost in Translation was not going to win Best Picture and Best Director; therefore, they just handed over the Best Original Screenplay award even when there was really no writing in the film. They gave the award away to Sofia Coppola in order to make history. This destroys the integrity of the Academy Awards because now I think Best Original Screenplay is not about the writing, but by the name of the writer. If it was Joe Blow who wrote the screenplay, the Academy Awards would have said: \\"Who cares!\\"Lost in Translation sucks! Plain and simple--it sucked!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Emperor's new ennui...","review":"To borrow an Americanism, I cannot help but be far out in the left field as far as this movie is concerned. I saw this movie in the theatre a while ago and frankly couldn't understand what the fuss was all about.Bill Murray gives another deadpan performance and Scarlett Johansson is impressive in her role as newly wedded (but ignored) bride. Yes, they are feeling rather alienated and are bored out of their minds (for whatever reason) in this city that seems to be teeming with life (and myriad forms of entertainment). Granted, some people will bored regardless of their surroundings, but does a movie about them have to be boring too?Or perhaps, it's an inside joke: a boring movie about boring people, who are themselves bored. In yours truly's opinion, just as the title aptly puts it, there's something \\"Lost in Translation\\"..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost in Character Development!","review":"This is one independent film (and believe me their are great ones) that had no business entering the mainstream fray - especially Best Picture territory. All you art film institute \\"types\\" need to get off the valium and stuff this one back in to Cannes film festival and keep it there. The film goes absolutely no where and takes 90 minutes too long in trying to develop its characters. By the time Murray delivered any scenes worth chuckling about or the occasional dialog that even REMOTELY left you anticipating the next scene, I was already in desperate need of shock treatment. I don't care if Nicole Kidman looked like a post Cival War barbie doll in Cold Mountain - that film runs circles around Lost in Translation and deserves to take its place in the winners circle."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Oscar material?","review":"Wow, this movie was very boring. The whole movie was nothing but scenes put together of two boring people doing nothing in Japan. There was a scene that was about 3 or 4 minutes long that showed nothing but Bill Murray's character trying to golf. It wasn't funny, and had nothing to do with the movie. Also, this movie makes the Japanese look like they're stupid, which is definitely not true. It also portrays Japan as a boring, terrible place, which it is not. My whole family hated this movie, and said that it was one of the most boring ones that they had ever seen. I don't get why this movie was rated so high with critics, and why it got any nominations at all at any of the award shows. It was boring, unfunny, overhyped, and was lost in stupid scene after scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Miserable Failure","review":"I saw this movie in the theater the week before the Oscars and was very offended. I thought I was the only one that didn't like the way the Japanese people were represented. It was very stereotypical, not funny, and lacked imagination. Borderline racist might be putting it nicely. It was horrible.After seeing \\"The Last Samurai\\" where the Japanese people/culture were treated with such respect and dignity, \\"Lost in Translation\\" was a complete disaster. But Hollywood loves good racism. She never should have been nominated for this movie. The screenplay was awful. She just made fun of Japanese people throughout the entire movie. How is that Oscar worthy???The academy should be embarrassed that they nominated \\"The Triplets of Belleville\\" and \\"Lost in Translation.\\" It's a tie between which one was actually more egregious. I've never written a bad review for anything on Amazon.com, but I was genuinely offended by this movie. I didn't like how the Japanese were portrayed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comedy it is not!!","review":"I thought this was a poor excuse for a movie, what a waste of Bill Murray's talents.

It was a tremdous disapointment. It is horribly slow, has little plot, and can these character's be more self absorbed? Japan is such an interesting place to visit even if you don't know the language. But these characters are so shallow they can't get past the differences in the language. If \\"Charlotte\\" is supose to be a philosophy grad, she sure wasted a lot of time in Japan not looking into the incredible amounts of philisophical sights and ideas that are right on the surface of this culture. It was about two really insecure people that had nothing to offer the audience at all. A great Graduate school project, but don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"utterly lost","review":"In writing this,I have to admit to having not seen the DVD version of this film.But I have seen the cinema version just this afternoon.What a lot of overrated tripe.The film has no meaning,no goal,and seems to drift from scene to scene.The characters seemed to lack a sense of purpose,and the European style \\"lingering shot\\" just looked ridiculous,as if the script writer had run out of ideas.I found trying to identify with the characters hard going ,and ultimately couldn't care less.If I were Bill Murray,I would be embarrassed to have appeared in this film,and even more embarrassed to receive an oscar for this role,a role in which not much was required.And as for Scarlett Johansson,the only thing that can be said about her ,is that she looks good in her underwear,little else.Lost in Translation's right,utterly lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"SLOW and DULL","review":"The movie is slow, almost to the point of no story at all. If you don't like intolerable cruelty then you won't like this one either. I don't know why people kept saying its good, I would rate it only two star.

I don't usually find it difficult to appreciate off-beat films on an artistic or intellectual level, but what this movie lacked in its ability to entertain (which is to say, none whatsoever), it failed to make up for in substance.

One of my most joyless and insipid movie watching experiences in recent memory."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies I've ever seen","review":"For the first half hour I thought, \\"Well, it starts really slow but...\\"For the next hour, I said, \\"This movie has to go somewhere, some time... or at least it has to end.\\"And the ending stunk. Other than those three parts, the beginning, middle and end, it was a great movie.I was on an airplane for 9 hours and this was the only movie they showed on the screen.

Don't waste your money on this. Rent it if you must, but find something, anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost in Worthlessness","review":"I am at a loss as to why anyone would like this film. It is the sad story of a long married man, alone in a strange city, where he can not speak the language, with no friends to communicate with, & a young married girl in the same situation having been abondoned by her artist husband for a few days. Bill Murray's character wants badly to jump the girls bones but can't/doesn't. When he does get the chance to get laid, its by the lounge singer in the hotel they are staying at. It was a boring 105 minutes of film for me. If he wins for best actor at the Oscars next week, I will eat my hat."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sweet film","review":"A lot of films have an elaborate, complex storyline where not much really happens. This film has a seemingly simple plot where a great deal happens. Put simply, it's a funny, sweet and endearing film which is beautifully directed.

One quote which stays with me is when Charlotte says \\"Let's never come back here again... because it will never be this much fun\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored in Translation","review":"What a pointless movie. I cannot believe they gave an Oscar to this snoozer. I agree with the reviewer that the clout of the Coppola name is the only thing that got this monotonous movie made (much less honored with an Oscar).There are a couple of times when I felt hopeful the story (such as it is) might actually take off, like the amusing exchange between the Japanese commercial director and Murray. But too quickly the scene passed, and the viewer is left watching the protagonists lying around their hotel rooms, doing nothing but stare out windows and up to ceilings.If the two main characters think they are bored in Japan, they should try watching this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, boring, don't know what the hype was about.","review":"This movie was stupid plan and simple.

There's one central \\"joke\\" which wears thin after 5 minutes (Bill and Scarlett are the recipients of a constant barrage of Japanese which, of course, they don't understand and so simply mimic back as best they can in an effort to communicate...such scenes go on forever and made me yell \\"All right...I GOT IT!\\") There's about 10 minutes of plot (will Bill and Scarlett make a love connection?) , 40 minutes of Bill looking bored and/or confused, and an hour of pulsating Japanese night life. Which is fine if you're looking for a travelogue.Someone else here referenced \\"The Emperor's New Clothes\\" which were our exact words as we turned off the DVD player without bothering to check the extra features.

There were some parts that would make you smirk but otherwise this was a boring film. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone for purchase or even rental.

I respect the cinematography in this film, but that plot is the most uninteresting, hole-filled, monotonous piece of garbage I've seen since \\"The Recruit.\\" But at least that had a cohesive story development.The idea of two self-loathing folks in need of companionship is not only formulaic, but bland. Had Sofia Coppola (who is also a terrible actress) chosen to pursue some sort of rebellious act of defiance between these two schmoes, other than that wimpy kiss at the end, my interest may have been held. But instead, these two whiners chose to get wasted in the city, party with some yuppees, and then decide they'll never see each other again. Wow. What a terrific ending.

No. A terrific way to waste an evening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite Possibly the Worst Movie Ever","review":"The praise and attention this movie was recieving in theaters and the Oscars drove me to check this movie out. I have never been more disgusted at a movie. The movie was so incredibly boring that I found myself drowsing during most of the film. Although labled as a comedy, I did not even get a slight smile out of the film. The acting was shameful, esecially for such icons as Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansen and the storyline itself was so basic and boring the whole point of the movie could have been conveyed in five minutes rather than dragging it out into a whole movie. This movie was a waste of time...don't bother wasting your time or money to see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I FELT MY BODY DYING!!!","review":"When the first credits began to roll at the end of this torturously long & boring movie, I fled the theatre, arms spread wide, eyes ablaze, looking for something, anything, to get my mind off of the last 100 minutes. I wanted to bathe in bleach, or perhaps gouge my eyes out just to feel clean again.40 minutes into Lost in Translation (which, by the way, is a new code word amongst friends, meaning GET ME OUT OF HERE!), I could actually FEEL my body DYING! I would have collapsed on the theatre floor if the movie had gone on much longer. No, seriously,Most scenes went on for minutes (MINUTES!) too long, and were boring in both their content and meaning when it came to the paper thin storyline and simplistic character development. I want both my money & my 100 minutes back!Unfortunately, I'm forced to give this movie at least one star. There's not an option for zero."},{"rating":"1","title":"It must be a joke","review":"This movie was awful. No story line, blatant metaphors about being alone even though surrounded by people. This could have been an important movie about finding friends when you least expect it or how people become so easily lost within and unhappy with their lives......I like independent \\"artsy\\" films BUT obviously the only reason this one got so much industry attention was because WHO the writer and director is. We can all hope she actually develops some talent instead of riding on her family name."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming film","review":"A middle-aged actor shooting a whiskey commercial (Bill Murray) and a neglected young wife (Scarlett Johansson), both American, cross paths in a Tokyo hotel. Both exist in a kind of limbo--emotionally distant from their spouses, physically distant from their homes and culture, tired and dissatisfied. A sweet friendship that avoids the traditional movie cliches grows between them. The story may seem meandering and aimless, but that is an accurate reflection of the lives of these characters. Murray plays his role with an easy, understated charm, and Johansson is charming and vulnerable. The authentic representation of Japanese society, augmented by on location filming in Tokyo, is another plus. Writer/director Sofia Coppola has done a terrific job."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOST IN WHY THIS IS A OSCAR WINNER.","review":"i give 2 stars, each for the actors. As for the restthe film goes everywhere and yet nowhere and when itit over the first thought in my mind is.....\\"let'sgo see a movie, its been such a long time\\". Boring,with some interesting moments this is the mosthyped film of the year. I thought a second viewingwould change my mind. There is NO way i could sitthrough this again, I realized after the first10 minutes..............all over again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Majorly disappointing, awful","review":"I don't care how many good things I've heard about this movie. It had like three funny parts (hello!, it was supposed to be a comedy). I heard it was a great movie, so I rented it. It was horrible, I hated it an awful lot. Lost In Translation was very boring, the directing may have been pretty good, and I didn't mind Scarlette Johanson so much, but still thought it was really boring. However, I like that Giovanni Ribsi was a member of the cast, he's a good actor and I don't see much of him. You're also probably thinking if I didn't like it, why am I taking time to review it, well I thought I'd just let everyone know it was bad, before they wasted money."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is pointless","review":"I cant believe Bill murray got oscar nominated for this movie becos this movie is BORING!!!!the only funny part is when hes auditianing.1 laugh 2 chuckles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I didn't care for this movie at all. Boring and without much of anything to keep my interest. The only thing I liked about it were the Tokyo scenes. Otherwise, I wish I'd saved my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"RACIST!!!!!!!!","review":"WHAT A HORRIBLE RACIST MOVIE....Only Japanese women you saw in the movie were either prostitute or silly interpreter who can't speak English. Besides the story and everything, this movie has a fundamental fault! DON'T WATCH IT AND MAKE FUN OF JAPANESE CULTURE."},{"rating":"1","title":"I got Lost As Well","review":"I really found this movie to be pretty bad!! I mean I watched this movie and felt no empathy for the characters. Bob was some rich lonely loser and the female role was nothing but a crybaby who was jealous of her husbands fame. I think she should have stayed home while he was in Japan if she was going to whine so much. I have truly seen the bottom of the barrel on this movie. The only saving grace this movie had was the beautiful scenery and a few really cool scenes into the true Japan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Umm, boring","review":"Ok, let's not overanalyze this rather two-dimensional plot. Characters, their interaction, their personal problems, yeah, well conceived, but... boring.This is a classic- a classic rental that is, or buy one of them used for $8..."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll Need a Double Expresso to Get Through This Yawner","review":"As a frequent traveler who has sometimes felt the displacement of another culture, I was looking forward to Lost in Translation. But twenty minutes into it, I was looking at my watch. If it weren't for the dialogue I would have sworn there was a technical problem and it was being shown in slow motion. Yes there were a couple of laughs, yes it was well acted, yes the cinematography was good but in the end nothing could overcome the weight of its incredibly slow pace. Perhaps I missed a deeper significance, but this movie was just plain boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Hollywood be any more stereotypical???","review":"Of course, most of the posters didn't pick up on this after they watched this cinematic atrocity... hmmmm... I wonder if it's cuz most of you are white Americans. Did anyone realize how they painted the Japanese in a non-human way? And every stereotype imaginable was used to portray the Japanese. I'm very embarrassed because this movie has received all these awards; what it should win is The Most Racist Film of 2003/2004 Award. I wish I didn't have to give this movie 1 Star.... I wish it could be in the negative range."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious and slow","review":"While sitting through this movie and the bonus features on the DVD I couldn't help but feel that those making it were constatnly thinking, \\"We are SO cool because we can travel the globe and make movies overseas.\\"The movie did have some beautiful shots of Tokyo but that was really about it. The story itself was very understated and simple and really never took off in my opinion. The story can be summed up by saying that two Americans unhappy with their relationships meet each other and then wander around Tokyo. Their wandering around takes them to karaoke bars, strip joints and sushi bars. That's it. Nothing beyond that really happens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes is this ever boring (and pretensious)","review":"Stay away, stay far away. Nothing to see here (literally)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointed","review":"Being a huge Bill Murray fan, I went into this movie wanting to love it. In fact, I purchased the movie before we even watched it! I went into it with no expectations except that it was going to be wonderful in an unconventional way. But try as I might, I couldn't like it. I found myself zoning out. My fiance and I discussed it at length, trying to understand why we didn't like it or why we didn't \\"get it\\". Then it hit me - it shouldn't be this hard. Just because some people consider it a great work doesn't mean everyone will. Murray has a few funny lines as you would expect, but the dialogue is extremely limited. A close friend of mine loved the movie because \\"she knows what it feels like to be lost\\" - she connected with Scarlett Johansson's character. I'm not sure if that means anything. Very rarely do I watch a movie, especially one so critically acclaimed, and feel as though I've wasted my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad.","review":"I can't remember the last movie I could not actually finish before this one, but i turned it off after about 30 minutes. I wasn't even vaguely interested in either of the main characters. I hope Bill Murray returns to what he is good at; Good Movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good acting --Sloooow slooow story","review":"Acting was good its is just the story never really got going. There is no plot in this movie, it is just more a 'life situation' or 'point in time'. And outside a few moments, its just not that funny.Don't see this movie unless you liked Bill Murry in 'The Razor's Edge'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch \\"Winged Migration\\" instead","review":"Please watch the film \\"Winged Migration\\" instead. That film has gorgeous photography of birds in flight and is truly life-affirming. It is NOT boring like this very bad movie about two depressed people getting together and doubling their depression. \\"Winged Migration\\" is 85 minutes long and will leave you in awe of the natural world.I only watched the first hour of this super-dull movie. Save your time and money. This movie is dull, pretentious, and incredibly bad. Let's hope the Academy gives its Oscars to other films and actors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who would nominate this movie???","review":"You will keep watching and watching and waiting and waiting...then nothing happens!!!! This was one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. I just kept waiting for something to happen...anything, but nothing ever did. What a waste of my time. Don't bother renting or buying this movie, you would have a more enjoyable time watching a blank screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame at best!!!!","review":"It kind of puzzles me how the film \\"critics\\" today rate films, and accordingly recommend films for honors, such as \\"best Screenplay\\", \\"best motion picture\\", etc. In my opinion, this movie is, at best, a waste of time - to say nothing of giving it those types of \\"honors\\". I can't believe anyone would be so fooled by a movie that is slow, lame, and pointless!!! Watch an old re-run of something on T.V., you'll be far better off!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Complete Flatliner","review":"I was told that this film was the best of the year and an absolute must for any serious film collector. Subsequently, I purchased it. What a mistake. My friends and I watched the film, silently taking it all in, and kept waiting for some pulse. It has none. The dialogue is completely flat and there is nothing interesting about the characters whatsoever. The viewer cares nothing about them. We laughed a bit during Bill Murray's scene in which he appears on a talk show, but that was about it. The most appealing element was the cinematography, which was indeed beautiful. I asked a friend who loved this film what the attraction was. She said it was \\"so cute and sweet.\\" There you have it."},{"rating":"1","title":"lost in the mundane","review":"Save yourself the cash!This is a massive disappointment.I was looking forward to seeing this movie for a long time before it was released - I should mention it didn't REALLY get released theatrically in Australia...and obviously for good reason.This is ART at it's most obscure.Avoid it at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"So sad that I will never get the time I wasted back","review":"Why? Why why why why why? I could write that another hundred times, but I'll shorten it up and say, do not rent this. Do not buy this. Do not tell other people it is good, because it is not. This was the biggest waste of time that I can recall. I truly can't think of a worse movie off the top of my head, besides possibly \\"Tank Girl.\\" When movies like this get nominated, I just wonder how and why? What is good about this movie? Could Francis Ford Coppola's influence really be so great that he could get his daughter nominated as best director for such a blatant piece of garbage such as this? The movie is slow, not funny, nothing happens. The only thing that makes this movie good is when the credits roll around, because you'll realize that you haven't died and gone to hell and aren't forced to watch this for eternity...luckily it does end, and you'll be thankful it does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gosh I liked Bill Murray so much more when he didnt know he was profound","review":"Wes Anderson and Sofia Coppola and Jarmusch all did him no favors. They are three of the most insincere, style over substance filmmakers around. And they all love clothes. And they all took a great baseball fan and turned him into an Oscar baiting self-serious ego wannabe genius walrus."},{"rating":"1","title":"(partly) why americans are hated","review":"I hated the movie, of course. My point, however, is that as an Australian in Germany I must point out that I am very quick to let people know that despite my English speaking accent, I am not American. Not because I hate Americans - I only hate American foreign policy and economic exploitation. The reason I make it clear I am not American is because most people in Europe really dislike America and Americans (Germany is not especially notable for this - it is more universal). This movie presents the stereotypical (exorbitant, culturally disrespectful and insular, lazy, self important) stereotype in all of it's hideous glory. To those Americans that swallow the crap fed to them on the media, try to watch this movie from the Japanese perspective. Sofia Coppola should be ashamed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fastforwarded through most of the movie","review":"I am in complete agreement with Jennifer Kokoski!!This was ridiculously slow and boring. I felt the piety of the characters to be interesting, but their attempt at redemption cheap. They are sad and lonely because they think too much of themselves; and though Charlotte tries to make an attempt at being moved by the \\"non-complex\\" - it's still a cheap shot. Her facial expressions of \\"revelation\\" made the character seem all the more pious.The only \\"good\\" part of the flick is the intellectual connection between Bob and Charlotte. However, it just seemed like they were too busy feeling sorry for themselves. \\"Oh poor pitiful me....in a world surrounded by stupid people....and things I don't understand.....wah\\". Puhleeez.Sorry folks - this flick is a dud. Don't waste your money buying it. Rent it first. I'd say it's probably a \\"cult\\" like flick - and either you get it, or you don't. I think I \\"got it\\" - and I still didn't like it.My Humble Opinion"},{"rating":"1","title":"One word sums up this movie: Garbage","review":"This is a pathetic movie with pathetic characters for pathetic moviegoers.

I was very tempted with this one, but I stuck it through til the end. Biggest waste of time ever.There is no chemistry, there is no spark. I thought the movie was very self-indulgent and the relationship between the two main characters wasn't developed enough. I didn't feel their connection, and this \\"connection\\" of their's is what the whole movie blathers on about.I honestly have no idea what all the rave reviews are about. We must not have seen the same movie at all.There are so many other great movies out right now... 21 Grams, Cold Mountain, Goodbye Lenin, Mystic River... Save your money or spend it more wisely on a better movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh, so so","review":"I don't know maybe my expectations were a bit too high. I expected something to happen in this movie. It never quite gets off the ground.Let's put Bill Murray in strange situations and see what happens should be the title. I always liked Bill Murray, but it seems he doesn't have enough to work with. I'm not sure what all the buzz is about this flick.The woman playing opposite Bill is quite a boring actress,it must be nice to have enough money to sit around in hotel rooms and stare out the window, boring.She truly is a piece of cardboard. My friend saw this movie and didn't like it either, he said it never quite came together.The only thing that happens is you lose your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Bunch Of Rubbish!","review":"Okay, here it is, the truth: This movie is so boring that I had to drink three Pepsis and eat a half-a-gallon of chocolate just to prop my eyes open. And for those of you trying to convince the rest of us the movie was too complicated for the average-Joe - or in my case, Jodie - to understand, give it a rest. I think the people who like this film may want to consider discussing Prozac with their doctor next visit.That's all. Please don't waste your money or your time.
