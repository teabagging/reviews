However, the quality on the discs is poor. We had trouble with a number of discs from the time we first opened our box.1.

When you would click to select the episode you wanted to watch, you would again have the problem that the disc did not respond at all. This happened with a few of the discs.2. LoudSome of the discs ran very loudly (which does not happen with others discs in my player).Some of the discs have menus that worked properly, and some of the discs ran normally. However, because several of the discs had problems, I felt that the quality of the set was poor.Overall, these are just wonderful shows but the quality on my discs was quite poor.

Also, my poor review has nothing to do with the program, but instead is with the quality of the DVDs in the Complete Series set.I ordered this twice. The first time I received it Disc 1 skipped and was completely unplayable right out of the box. Amazon easily refunded my money and I returned it. I love the program so after several months I decided to try again and reordered. This time the discs all play but part of the sound is missing. Anytime the school bus changes or there is supposed to be some dramatic type music there is instead silence. It is extremely annoying to the point of making the DVDs very hard to watch.

The set list looks great, but the show was a real stinker. I own most of the Dick's picks, and this one gets the least amount of playing time (make that NO playing time). The only part of this 3-disc set I listen to is disc 2. Just a poor choice. Vince's keyboard playing is like nails on a chalkboard. There are so many other shows from the otherwise great year of 1990 that could have been chosen. Instead of this set of coasters, buy Dozin' or the great Nightfall of Diamonds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low on your list of priorities","review":"OK, it's the Dead, and anything Dead is good, as far as I'm concerned. Having said that, if you're looking into some Dead, there are many better choices of Hornsby shows where Jerry plays off him with emotion. Vince is harsh throughout and ham-handed on his solos. Energy is really uneven on the CD, which was the thing that got me off the bus - too few peaks. If Hornsby is the reason to buy this CD, as it was for me, keep looking and save yourself the waiting. Some of those RFK shows with Hornsby were really great - look for a good tape of them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not even think about it!!!","review":"I posted a review of this last year, believing that this a paltry show at best, but it was never posted? I thought OK maybe I'll go back and \\"re-review\\" it. After listening again, I uphold my opinion: this collection is crap!!!There are 3 CDs. The first starts of with some good energy. CD 2 is the better of this bad show. Samson>>IKO>>Looks Like Rain>>Jam, but not at all worth the price. As for CD 3, forget there is even a CD #3...it's that bad!Minuses: The collective efforts of Bruce and Vince. Jerry's thin vocals. The midi orcestration(too much). Any track with Vince singing. A bad version of Morning Dew? (yes even Morning Dew was caught in the fray of this terrible collection)Pluses: Cold Rain and Snow sounds ok, and a semi-nice Feels Like Rain. (I'm being quite generous.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was at this show and it was mediocre at best...","review":"I haven't actually purchased this CD but I was at this show and it was mediocre at best. I caught 7 of the 9 MSG shows that fall and this was probably among the worst of the bunch. Cassidy, Deal and Iko Iko were fun simply because they're always great tunes to hear the Dead do, but there was nothing spectacular about them. Vince and Bruce were new and (IMHO) it took Vince until a long time after the Fall 1990 tour to get into the Dead's groove. I would normally buy a Dick's Picks of any show I was at, but not this one. When is a Hampton '89 Warlocks Dick's Picks gonna come out?!?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Notch Under Blah","review":"Garcia swings from completely lost to \\"barely cutting it,\\" while the keyboards - yet again - ruin an otherwise decent-sounding recording. Nothing much worth hearing; stick with Summer '89 & prior."},{"rating":"1","title":"I COULD'VE TRADED BETTER AND CHEAPER","review":"The first CD of this pick leaves me wondering why I bought it when I could've traded a better show for free. There's just one word that describes it, and that's BORING! Although the song list is great, the performance is not. Cold Rain and Snow isn't to be missed, but the rest is slow and heartless. Jerry is lost on Stagger Lee, and can't find him in Queen Jane either. The Iko on the second CD is awesome, but I've heard better Looks Like Rains. The 3rd CD is the only redeeming factor on this pick. The Standing on the Moon brings tears to your eyes and chills up your spine. The Miracle and It's all over now is great too, but you could probably find just as good on a tape from a good friend. In short, if I had it to do all over again, I wouldn't. Not this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"less energetic, yet beautiful performance","review":"As Grateful Dead fans know, the Dead's shows during the nineties tended to be less energetic, and more melloncolic than their earlier years. The shows tended to reflect Jerry's condition sometimes to the detriment of the show, and sometimes it sounded so sweet it could bring you to tears. This show is no exception. \\"Cassidy\\" is an energetic song which has seen much better performances (see: acoustic version from Reckoning). However, Hornsby is able to pick things up with riffs during \\"Tennessee Jed\\" and \\"Samson and Delilah.\\" My favorite moment comes in the third cd with an immaculate and heart felt version of \\"Standing On The Moon.\\" This is not their best, but more than worth the money for true Dead fans who can't get enough of the Dead's live stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Band Cooks","review":"Okay, I bought this thing because I wanted one w/ Hornsby on it, in spite of the reviews. The reviews above were correct in their details but wrong in their conclusion. Yes Welnick often-plays harsh sonic textures - but they are cool sounding. Yes, we could use more of Bruce - but he helps the band rock. The comment that real story on this CD is Phil Lesh - is on target. The Dead play not that tight - yes. But, the CD rocks all over the place. The first set cooks, the mix is great - the drums are sooo clear and the band just grooves. I gotta recommend it - its great. For a tight Hornsby show try DP18."},{"rating":"2","title":"Healthy crunch","review":"These are the perfect addition to salads and to morning musli and yogurt.

One boat never made it to the water because it deflated quickly. The other one stayed inflated, but the black patches on the side must have retained heat from the sun and became soft because it bulged and looked like it would pop at any moment. One of the oars broke with normal use. The one bright spot was the pump. It was small but worked fast. For the price this was very thin plastic and a total bust. Thank goodness the dealer took them back with no problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stories","review":"This DVD is a hit with our 2 1/2 year old grandson.

While cooking food to the correct temperatures to prevent foodborne illnesses is certainly important, cooking roasts to 290 F; burgers to 320 F and poultry to 360 F, will yield a totally inedible and revolting product. Likewise, reheating leftovers to 330 F will not aid in economical use of leftovers. (The correct temperatures should be approximately 140F, 160F, 180F and 160 F, respectively).

One kitten had no issue transitioning to the litter box, the other one was indiscriminate in where she went. After doing a bit of online searching, we stumbled upon Precious Cat Cat Attract, and thought it was worth a try. My husband emptied out the old litter, and poured this stuff in. Before he even had a chance to smooth it out the problem cat was in the box doing her business. We couldn't believe it.As we ran low on this kitty litter, and had no more issues with the problem cat, we decided to transition back to our old kitty litter. However, she quickly started messing around the house again. I don't know what they put in this stuff, but it worked wonders for our kittens. There really wasn't too much of a price difference between this and our previous litter, so there's no going back for us.

If your cat has simply decided that THIS SPOT in your house is THE SPOT, then I'd say you're pretty much SOL and will have to spend some quality time together. For me, that's sitting near THE SPOT when I'm home, making sure she walks on by to her litterbox. No, covering the spot doesn't work.

He writes with the imagery of a novel but hues to the objectives of non-fiction. The book is both lively and informative."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Silly Book","review":"This may be one of the worst historical books I've read. There is no perspective, so you see four years of Charles' life as if it were an isolated period with no analysis of the impact of the Moors in Spain, the betrothal discussions with Irene in the Byzantine Empire, and Baghdad is simply an island of a short story with the only impact on Charlemagne being the elephant he was sent.If you want to understand this part of history, then this definitely isn't the book to get. If you really want to understand the religious perspective that Charles of Tour and Pepin started, begin with Gregory of Tours. Then read Einhard's history of Charlemagne (they can be a trudge...but, worth it). Then get some perspective with Henri Pirenne's book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Latin Music DVD and CD series from PBS!","review":"I have always enjoyed Latin music.

This package includes new songs from the Dream Team, Nico Canada, General Degree, T-Quest, and many others, plus the original \\"Reggaeton\\" songs that started the entire Reggaeton Revolution all the way back in 1987.

I had no problem putting the bike together, the handbrake assembly was not very clear in the instructions. But once I figured it out, they were easy to assemble. The only dissappoinment is the location of the water bottle holder. The designers put it on the bottom side of the angled frame support. It gets dirty from the road, especially if it's wet outside.

After reading and sharing this book i'm convinced that it could be a useful tool in gaining greater insight about Black Gay Folks.

It's made priceless by the performances of the three women. Harriet Reynolds stands out as Sue, an unremittingly morose one-and-a-half-times-size Julie Andrews look- and sound-alike who, like everyone else involved, falls in the path of party hostess and steam-roller Beverly (Alison Steadman).

Or so I thought. Between Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf and 70's porn. And here it is. Wow! All pornography is is man's attempt to fill in the missing scenes of soap operas. This is more unusual void filling than that. This is the greatest porn film ever made -- without sex. So many times here the dialogue and situations feel like a porn movie is about to unzip yet they continue and you cannot believe it. This is very funny and if you've only seen Mike Leigh's later works nothing like you'd expect. If you've ever sat through through Look Back In Anger or other highly overpraised, or at least dated works. This is not that. The ironic mustache of recent years began to grow here. I don't know how this was received at the time but this is fantastic. I rented The Rules of The Game, The Earrings of Madame De, Divorce Italian Style and this.

With the introspective albeit too much harmonied We Are Finding...getting you into the grove the album starts. Some of their songs sound like Pantera playing Beatles, loads of vocal harmonies with tough shredding from Ty Tabor, one of the best and the most underrated guitarist ever.Its Love is a classic, mellifluos melody fused with authentic metal guitars, what a number, one of the best songs of this band. Other such classics include Fine ARt and Mr. Wilson, both stand aparts in the album. Moanjam is brilliant, a little like Faith No More or something like that, it rocks you and the lead that Ty plays here in this one, is one of the best the man ever did. I Cant Help It, tittle song and Legal Kill are 10/10, beautiful songs with superb guitars.All in all if you are a metal fan you should like this album, if you are a Kings X fan you will love this album so its worth getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen","review":"One of my favorite rock CDs. A fine effort by the trio from Texas, I recommend it to anyone who enjoys listening to music, and doesn't mind a hard edged sound. If you prefer a nice, quiet evening at home, you'd better look elsewhere.When I first heard this recording, I thought King's X sounded like a cross between Rush and The Beatles. I still think that's a pretty good assessment, albeit a rather limited one. King's X has their own sound, and one listen to any track on this recording should make that clear. Vocals reign on \\"It's Love\\" and Guitars roar on \\"Moanjam.\\" It's nice to hear the fine art of subtlety, a lost art among rock bands, show up on tunes like \\"Six Broken Soldiers\\" and \\"Legal Kill.\\"If you're looking for a challenging listen, and are tired of formulaic rock radio, but still long for a hard rock sound, stop here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this \\"album\\"","review":"Great vocal harmonies, grungy, bluesy rock and roll guitar, not too fast, interesting lyrics, that grab you. I play this album over and over. As a believer I heartily recomend this to other believers. To others, I would readily do the same. This is quality music, and this era of King's X is my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"Faith Hope Love is a funk-metal opus. This is a masterpiece that is a treat for the privileged few who are aware of King's X and their powerful tones. The shining star, \\"It's Love\\", can lift the spirits of the most depressed person and seems like it can heal your soul. This is the shining star of the career of King's X. The champion of the underrated, the hero of the ignored and snubbed, King's X just keeps on making great albums.IF YOU ARE A FAN OF ROCK AND ROLL MUSIC, BUY THIS IMMEDIATELY."},{"rating":"2","title":"INTENSELY SPIRITUAL ALBUM FROM ONE OF ROCK'S BEST BANDS","review":"When I first got this album, I was a little disappointed because I didn't anticipate the direction the band went from \\"Gretchen...\\", expecting a more artsy work. Instead, they showed a more transparent perspective spiritually in this material and a real insight into what kind of things they had been dealing with in life. This has since become one of my favorite albums.

I've lost a little respect for Mr. Munroe for misleading his faithful readers like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Death wish, death sentence, death period","review":"Go figure, both Dead Wish and Death Sentence, the sequel, were out of print for ages until the Kevin Bacon film Death Sentence appeared in 2007. So they brought it back in print, slapped a film tie-in cover, and likely duped a few folks who thought it was a novelization or was more related to the new film.Death Sentence was the Chicago follow-up to Death Wish and has Paul Kersey taking his vigilante act on the road, just as was suggested at the end of the first film. The novel is short and brisk and not very deep, and lacks something the first one had...written almost like a film tie-in.Either way, since the Death Wish film series entered camp territory with the third one in the 80s, the regular-guy vigilante flick has been cheapo territory. Probably more for fans of the first book than movie, this isn't bad but it's just odd they didn't bring both books back in print."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down!","review":"I was very disappointed in this book!I have always said that the books were better than the movies they made from them, but in this case it's not true!

The truth is, if it wasn't for the feminists pushing for the ridiculous no-fault divorce laws and encouraging women to be as undesirable and masculine(sleeping around unmarried, looking down on housework and cooking, being pushy and dominant in areas they should have left for the guys, etc) as possible has increased the divorce rate.

Dr. Warren Farrell's excellent\\" The Myth Of Male Power \\" explains this and many other failures of Hirshman's nutbaggery, so her failure to be minimally aware ofsuch fine works is appalling for someone claiming to write above the kindergarten level.BTW, the reason is \\" women don't marry men who don't work \\".Statistically speaking, thats accurate.

I had the model 2349 Heritage Series Legacy edition of this mixer and paid almost $300 for it. First it had screws and nuts that held the bottom of the beaters together and one came off without me knowing and a friend almost broke a tooth. Really embarrasing. Wrote company and they did send new beaters. Then I tried to make a dense cake batter for a birthday cake and it over heated and had to cool down before I could continue. Now today the beaters just quit turning completely and will not turn again. It is not like I overuse this unit. Until I retired 2 years ago I diid not use it much. Just last year I got back to cake decorating once or twice a year. My trusty GE hand beater had to take over today. My mother always had sunbeam and I thought this would be reliable and dependable for $300. Boy was I wrong!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just watch it fall apart","review":"I hope that this is the poorest quality mixer on the market. I have had it for a couple of years and frequently repair it. If I ever have to buy a part, I will throw it away first. When anyone else in the house uses it, I make sure I am around as they will be calling me about one problem or another. Even parts that do work, do not work well. The motor tilt button is very difficult to push. I pops out easy enough but getting it to release the motor is another story. The bowl table is lose and is grinding itself into little bits of black plastic on the base. The mixing action leaves pockets of ingredients on the bottom as well as the sides. If you have even though about buying this mixer, DON'T."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic gears","review":"We also bought the Sunbeam Mixmaster based on previous experience. It is unfortunate that the new products have sacrificed quality for cost. The drive gears for the beaters are now plastic and do not hold up to moderate load (Marshmallow Creme frosting??!??). I found that it stripped the teeth right off the head of the beater drive sleeve when I investigated. Of course I cannot find the parts to repair.The wife and I are now going to go for quality instead of this low-cost alternative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not last.","review":"Sunbeam 2350 Heritage Stand Mixer WhiteMy Sunbeam Heritage died yesterday. I felt I had to do a review on it to help those that might make the same mistake. When I got the mixer 1 year ago I was very happy with it. It was half the price of a kitchenaid. It had good weight and the motor sounded great. The first probelm I had was the base jumping which by the way looks metal but is made of plastic. Then where the mixer hinges got loose which would cause the arm with the motor to bounce. Even with the weight it was not heavy enough if I was mixing bread dough or even frosting it would jump all over the counter. Yesterday my whatever turns the mixers (not the technical term) got off so they cannot turn. It's now an expensive paperweight. I highly reccomend just biting the bullet and buying the more expensive kitchenaid. That is what I will do next time. That is unless you only need a mixer for a year or less. Good luck to you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"I bought this mixure primarily for Dough recipes but it just simply won't handle that... If I put the mixer on high # 3 knead it shuts off after about 15 minutes of use. Additionally, the knob in the back has completely come loose so as the mixer is \\"mixing\\" the speed varies up and down so you have to tape it or keep re-adjusting. I just bought a Kitchen Aid Pro 6 series can't wait to get it!!! P.S. it has the most messed up dough hook out of all the mixers I've seen. Plus it is too light the the mixer moves around A LOT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can do better by hand!!","review":"I wanted a stand mixer to mix bread dough. I saw this on sale and it looked really sturdy and usefull. Looks are deceiving! The recipe called for egg whites that were frothy- the beaters didn't reach to the bottom of the bowl to do this, used my hand mixer. Then when adding the flour mix the motor started to slow down and really pull after 1/4 the total flour. When I tried to change the speed of the mixer nothing happened. I'm pretty sure I can do better with by hand than this mixer does. The bowl and beaters were supposed to turn together--only if you turn the bowl and use a scraper does the batter eventually mix up.I took mine back after 1 try and will look for something that will actually mix."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid mixer","review":"This mixer has served me very well. It is very powerful, yet quiet. I love the turn dial on the back to vary speeds. I use it maybe once a week and I have owned it for 3 years. I have never had any problems at all. I like it better than the kitchenaid mixer because its solid, yet light enough to put away in the cabinet when not in use. It also has a classy appearance, unlike others that look robotic. I am trying to find another one to give as a wedding gift, but I guess they aren't made anymore, too bad. If you can find a used one, I recommend buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sunbeam mixer Heritage","review":"I have had 2 of the same brand. After the first died I figured it was my fault.

I think it would probably br great for cake mixes though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this Mixer!","review":"I bought this mixer because I had owned a Sunbeam stand mixer that worked like a champ for 21 years. It is obvious that the quality of Sunbeam's newer offerings is lacking. This mixer started to have problems after just one year of use. The motor would died out during mixing. Resetting the dial would get it to start up again, so I just dealt with it. However, now it is totally unusable as it is stuck and will not tilt back, so the beaters can not be inserted. I feel ripped off, because I thought I was buying a quality product, based on my past experience with Sunbeam!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get cookin'","review":"I have done serious cooking and baking for 45 years and have always used the Sunbeam mixers. They last for many years and I enjoy the flexibility of being able to get spatulas, etc. into the bowl to scrape down sides, and the ability to add ingredients easily while the beaters are running. Also, the price is always good compared to the Kitchen Aid or other up-scale brands of mixer. I don't need all the attachments that come on the other brands since I have individual appliances to do those types of things.This model is especially quiet and powerful, and looks good on the kitchen counter where I like to keep it for availibility. Some of the Holidays I wish I had two of these mixers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for heavy use","review":"I received this as a Christmas present in 2006. I do a lot of baking, and this was fine for light jobs (cake batter, whipping butter, etc.), but it labored with heavier things like cookie dough. The motor made a grinding noise when mixing heavy things, and stuff had a tendency to crawl up the sides of the bowl, necessitating scraping them down with a spatula. Then I tried kneading bread dough with it, and the motor died - despite Sunbeam's claims that you can use the mixer to knead dough! They don't make any replacement parts other than beaters and bowls available, so my mixer is now an expensive paperweight. It didn't even last two years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have used this mixer for over a year...","review":"I purchased this mixer last year for one daughter, am going to buy another for the older daughter who returned a different one she got at Christmas.

I'd recommend it especially for parents when they first learn that a disability may exist."},{"rating":"2","title":"At last, a way parents can help","review":"This hefty resource is informative, insightful and, most of all, inspirational--giving parents a way to reach children who often seem so unreachable. In addition to the very concrete instructions on how to do Floor Time, it provides a wealth of information on the emotional development and behavioral challenges of neurologically impaired children. Dr. Greenspan is well-known and well-respected in special-education circles, so if you, like me, are the kind of parent who is constantly copying passages of favorite books to give to teachers and Child Study Team members, know that the material here will get their attention. Only one quibble: How are parents with challenging children supposed to find the time to read a book as big and information-packed as this one? All the same, it's well worth the effort. Who needs sleep, anyway?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish this had been the first book I read after diagnosis.","review":"There is no book on PDD/Autism that has meant more to our daughter's life. Though Greenspan is an M.D. the writing style of this text is very readable (probably due to Wieder !) and is full of stories and examples of children who have made dramatic gains after initial developmental delays. The diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorders is still very vague and leaves parents feeling unsure of what to do next.

She is making wonderful gains and I am very thankful I found this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fantastic Resource for Parents and Educators","review":"As a clinician I have read many books on special needs children and I was particularly impressed with this book. The tone is positive, pro-active and gives parents concrete things they can do in order to meet their children exactly where they are. Also, no other books describes the symptoms of many syndromes with such clarity, so that parents and therapists can work with empathy and vision. For some situations, additional therapy modalities may be necessary and this may feel too \\"light,\\" but taken as, at the very least, an adjunct to whatever therapy is given, this book is just top notch.

It is both accurate to the original tongues and easy to read. Many misinterpretations and invalid arguements are handled simply by using this text (since many other English versions use a dynamic equivalent approach to interpretation that lends them to inaccuraces). Unlike those of Witness Lee's cult, I found the omissions of his comments a blessing since Mr. Lee filters much Eastern Mysticism into his explanations. Still a great version which you will use more and more as you study more deeply into the Scriptures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two thumbs up for the Holy Bible!","review":"The Holy Bible reaches several rungs above the good--right into the fabulous! This electifying book entails not only the endless saga of good over evil, but epic wars, love, intrigue, suspence, action, lust, and so many twists and turns, it will leave you breathless. And even if you figure out the story's surprise ending, it packs an amazingly emotional wallop when it comes. I give this 4 stars, only because of some of the strange parts in the beginning having to do with apples and snakes, and this girl intoxicating her father and then \\"knowing\\" him, and some other things that just didn't seem to make sence.

It'll be the biggest loss in your quest for Bibilical truths, if you passed this book just because someone left a bad review with a purpose to defame the author.

I read in four different languages and so far this is the best, translated and interpreted Bible I have had in any language. I investigated a lot before I started meeting with the church in my city. Every accusation I encountered was either flat out a lie or a result of blindness. It troubles me that God's children are deprived from such reaches that are in the ministry of Witness Lee. We all have been gifted with a mind. If a seeking person utilizes his or her mind with an open spirit he will see what I saw in the Bible when it is opened the way it is in the Recovery version.

Coming off as more of an uncensored episode of any prime-time TV cop drama than a real crime saga, Streets of Blood features plenty of shaky camerawork, and even shakier accents. As much as I love Val Kilmer, he's just so stale here, and the fact that his accent keeps changing up doesn't help matters either. Sharon Stone is more than guilty of this as well, as 50 Cent ends up putting in the best performance of the whole show here. Still, Streets of Blood manages to be oddly compelling for most of its running time despite its many flaws, and I guess that in itself makes it at least worth a look for fans of Kilmer or gritty cop dramas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fat Val Is a Cajun","review":"Fat Val gets a payday and stoops to working with bucktoothed non acting Fitty Cent.

I purchased this collection along with most of the accessories they had in the store (including the window treatments - which are fantastic)and started to put our nursery together this weekend.

I gave it a lot of thought because it is soo much more expensive than any other set. I am now very sorry that I did. When I registered the coordinating mobile was advertised to arrive in May, (which was perfect because that's when I was due). However, a couple of months later when I went to buy it, I was told that it had been recalled. I had to go out and buy a mobile that doesn't match. I know it doesn't seem like a big deal, but this was my first child and I had justified the price by saying that each of my children would be able to use it. Now I wish I had gotten a set from Pottery Barn Kids which was actually cheaper and includded all the coordinating pieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was so disappointed when I saw this pattern in the store.

I'm writing the review here because the comforter is the same as the Starlight set. We washed the comforter as directed and it pilled immediately and looks terrible now. The back of the comforter doesn't seem to fit the front anymore, one side shrunk more than the other. Also, the comforter is a square shape, not a full-size toddler bed comforter as most crib sets include so we cannot use it once we move our baby to a toddler bed. I love the look of our set and the bumpers, curtains, sheets, and bed skirt are fine, but I am terribly disappointed in the comforter. We spent a huge amount of money on this set and I expected it to wear better. Our little one is only 9 months and I've already thrown away the comforter. For the money, it's just not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not purchase this until you see it in person ...","review":"The pictures on this website are not accurate as far as color is concerned.

These are classic rock songs, done by some of the greatest rock bands of all time such as Deep Purple and AC/DC, and their omission from the CD will be inexcusable for those who have seen the film.Buy it if you want a taste of some classic rock, but there are much better rock compilations available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Those who cant do teach.","review":"If you are one of the many that find yourself singing songs from this movie like 247 thanbuy this cd its one of my new favorite cds.Its very funny and all of the songs are reallycatchy.When I say funny I mean like sometimesthey will have little phrases from the movieon it its cool.Oh also they cuse just A teenybit if that would bother anybody.If you dont like rock music than you wontlike this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"song plz","review":"hey do you know the name of that song at the end of the movie.The one at the battle of the bands . the one that jacks old band was playing. ive been searching for that song everywhere its amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Soundtrack","review":"This movie was great I love it.

The film's star Jack Black with the kids he worked with in the film recorded a couple of tunes from this album,the title track and IT'S A LONG WAY TO THE TOP. The latter track also featured AC/DC. Black and the kids recorded the songs as SCHOOL OF ROCK. Memorable classic rock tunes from this album include The Doors' 1969 hit TOUCH ME(not heard in the film) and Cream's 1968 hit SUNSHINE OF YOUR LOVE. However,in one scene of the film,Dewey Finn(Black) and one of the Horace Green Elementary School children,are performing TOUCH ME themselves. Other great rockers are Stevie Nicks' THE EDGE OF SEVENTEEN and The Who's SUBSTITUTE. This album contains a few bits of dialogue from the film also.

All the other songs are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Rocks!","review":"A great rockin' movie like \\"School Of Rock\\" deserves a great rockin' soundtrack, and such this CD is. Who can say no to an album that has classic tunes by The Who, The Doors, Led Zeppelin, Cream, AND Stevie Nicks? Certainly not me! And, as an added bonus, the two songs by film stars Jack Black & the schoolkids (under their group name, the School Of Rock) are just as awesome. What more needs to be said? If you're a fan of classic rock music, then you've just *gotta* pick up the \\"School Of Rock\\" movie soundtrack.

Do not be fooled by the other Modern Lover CDs, this is the one to get! It was produced by John Cale in 1972 and is the missing link between the Velvets and punk rock.

The kids are AMAZING; they actually play their own instruments on the \\"School of Rock\\" and \\"Long Way to the Top\\" songs. The music for the movie was well picked, not to wild, but not too sedated. Perfect for a lesson on rock. While the soundtrack has many of the songs in the movie, the producers seem to have left out ACDC's \\"Back in Black.\\" What's up with that? How can you put in low-talent No Vacancy's songs but forget one of rock's greatest hits? It's a mystery to me. But the more important thing is how much the kids rock.

I saw this movie for free while I was over seas in the deserts of Saudi Arabia. That was the only good thing about this movie. I love comedies, but this was hardly one. I can recall laughing only a few times throughout the entire movie. It was unrealistic, and hard to believe. The first 10-15 minutes actually decieved me into believing that this might actually turn ou decent, but I was horribly wrong. It seemed to drag on for hours. The plot was dry and predictable, and the acting was mediocre. Too many scenes seemed, well, forced. I applaud the effort to demoralize societies judgment system on \\"attractiveness\\", but maby they should have put more effort into making a quality film.In summary i would probably never watch this film again unless I was bed-ridden, could not reach the remote and it was playing on TBS some Sunday 5 years down the road...but that wouldn't happen because they actually play good movies on TBS Sunday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, I Can't See the Humor Here","review":"Making fun of obesity is hardly cause for laughter.Sorry, I just couldn't get past that"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really not as funny as it could be","review":"The subject of this movie is meant to be funny, I guess no one thought though that people who are overweight are discriminated against every day as are the ugly people like in the movie.Having said that, all the parts as usual that are funny were shown in the previews, Jack Black does a good job in his role of Hal, and Gweneth Paltrow, although I generally speaking can't stand her does deserve props for putting on that fat suit every day because that had to hurt and be hot.The movie is worth a look, just make sure you arent the one paying to see it, get your friend to!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelente comedia","review":"Esta comedia a pesar de presentar conflicto por el tema la obesidad, realza el valor de las personas sobre su condicion fisica."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's go Swimming","review":"I happened to tape this one night and I was kind of wary to watch it. I heard the good reviews that it was a good, lighthearted film. However, I am a bigger girl and that just made me apprehensive.After finally being able to watch this, I give the Farrelly Bros. two thumbs up, along with Jack Black. Paltrow I thought did a good job at being kind of shy, yet accepting of how her character was.Only thing that did not fit with this film were Rosemary's clothes. No way would a bigger girl wear a bikini, a skirt that went above her knees, high heels ALL the time, and tank tops. We know what to wear to make us look good and those certainly wouldn't work.All in all, I recommend this film to all bigger people, ugly people, people with outrageously curly hair and braces. It'll make you not care about your physical appearance as much. Maybe you'll be less hard on yourself.

I love those type of movies because there's always a sweet surprise in it. Big-hearted.But the acting surprised me. I think it had something to do with a script that didn't handle the message particularly well; of course you know there's a message, and a good one, too, but it has to be worked naturally into the story through events and outcomes, not through scripty, artificial dialog that preaches at the viewer. More effective to charm the audience with warm, likable characters and their weight-related struggles. Maybe the forced, artificial dialog had an impact on the acting. Moreover, they don't need the gratuitous sensuality-this story idea can carry itself just fine without it. With the right dialog.Otherwise, a great message and a big heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I'd known it was a Farrelly movie...","review":"I would have never got it.It's a mix-mash of a movie.You may still enjoy it, but it's almost like 3 movies in 1:1.

The social commentary and heartwarming feel-good romance.Mostly, it's #'s 1 & 2 that don't jive with each other. This isn't a 'straight' comedy, because it's marred with insensitive jokes that COULD have been used just to enhance the feelings at the beginning, but even at the end of the movie they're still throwing them around. It's just a mess of a movie. They add some feel-good commentary, but *other characters* don't act consistently, and when they do stir up more responsible feelings, they let them die under the next rhino joke.Pathetic.

The acting by Gwenyth Paltrow and Jack Black is great, and the plot is original. There are a few twists, and it was entertaining to see how Hal overcame several problems- many of them years old. Hal is a man who only like beautiful women, no matter what their personality is. Then he's hypnotised to only see women what they're like on the inside, leading to some hilarious moments. Shallow Hal has a great message about not caring what people look like, just about how they act and what they do. Definitely worth renting.MY GRADE: B+"},{"rating":"2","title":"That new thing called sarcasm","review":"Men being shallow? That's unheard of! This movie breaks the barriers and covers a subject that no one was ever aware of until now. On a more serious note, if you're going to talk about an issue like the superficiality of judging people strictly by looks, you might as well put a hilarious twist on it. Jack Black superbly portrays a man who is caught up in the physical beauty of women and has a spell put on him so that he will only see women's inner beauty. This obviously leads to side-splitting endeavors as Hal encounters true love for the first time. Gwenyth Paltrow turns in a fabulous performance that is very different from her past roles and George Costanza, wait...I mean Jason Alexander does a great job of playing the concerned \\"What are you doing with these horrible women??\\" friend.

If you want to learn about this subject just type \\"Japanese Red Army\\" into Google or Wikipedia, and you will find just as much, if not more, information.

It's a happy surprise that Legacy approached Mr. Penn and asked for his input on the selections. Some may quibble about the preponderance of tracks from Resigned and MP4, but if that's indicative of how the artist feels about his catalog, it's hard to argue.In arranging things by mood instead of chronology, the compilation serves certain, perhaps previously overlooked tunes very well- \\"Out Of My Hands\\", the alternate version of \\"Try\\" and \\"Brave New World\\" fairly grab the listener by the lapels.This is a very idiosyncratic overview of Michael Penn's earlier output. Are any of the new, alternate or demo versions vital to the casual listener? Probably not. Nonetheless, Palms & Runes, Tarot & Tea is the rare compilation that seems to measure up as cohesive statement in any context. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This book along with the Glycemic Index to Weight Loss kept me focused to lose weight the healthy way, and to keep it off."},{"rating":"2","title":"It really made good sense the way its written.","review":"This book was very informative of how our body works.I learned alot from reading this book.I feel it gave lots of facts and sound advice how to work with your bodies natural system to lose unwanted weight.I think this is a keeper, I'll use it as a reference manual in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"How heavy is this!","review":"The description says it 999 pounds, the seller is ripping you off!

Caramels are especially sensitive to temperature changes. I regret buying this thermometer for two reasons: 1) The base/bulb of the thermometer is at a height that it often isn't fully submerged in the pot.2) Even worse, after my last batch of caramels and the hard candy lollipops were overcooked, I realized that the thermometer is not fixed securely against the number scales, It slides up and down, thereby rendering it quite inaccurate. That was what had happened and what I thought were \\"perfect\\" temperatures, were actually about 5-10 degrees higher than they should have been. Very frustrating when you are doing something time consuming (with costly ingredients).Unless someone can recommend a better candy thermometer, I guess I'll stick with using two (at the same time) of the store brand themometers. I DO NOT recommend this themometer. High price and seemingly sleek design do not equal quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent tool","review":"This thermometer was right on target when tested with boiling water. It's a good, sturdy, invaluable cooking tool at a very reasonable price. The only thing I don't like about it is the amount of offset provided by a metal tab at the bottom, which is intended to keep the thermometer from resting directly against the side or bottom of a pot. While this is important when working with a deep container, it makes it almost impossible to use this thermometer when working with a smaller amount in a shallow container. Overall, though, this thermometer is an excellent value for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great if you only use it once...","review":"I made some chips British style... gorgeous with plenty of salt and lashings of vinegar.I attempeted to deep fry again about a week later, and the thermometer wouldn't give me a temperature.

It was intact when I put it in there and hadn't been knocked about?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for 4 months","review":"This was a great thermometer for 4 months. I make a decent amount of candy. I don't use a candy thermometer daily or even once a week, but I put it to use at least 2 or 3 times a month. This thermometer worked very well for a while. I checked it against the old fashioned way of determining what stage your candy is at and it was always accurate. Thankfully I know how to do this because it just completely quit working one day. I have no idea why. There were no visible signs of damage and it had worked fine the time before. I tried it with the next batch and no go. The thermometer would reach 220 degrees and fail to move any higher. I wouldn't recommend this thermometer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful and sturdy thermometer","review":"I bought this thermometer because it reads in F. as well as C. and it is long enough to extend into my 12 qt. pot and still allow for easy reading of the temperature. It has a \\"stay cool\\" plastic grip, and the glass is encased in a metal sheath, making it very sturdy. This is an affordable, accurate, well-made item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Numbers worn off after less than 1 year, so-so accuracy","review":"After using this thermometer only once, I decided to check the accuracy of this thermometer with boiling water. It was off by 9 degrees. That's enough to make a significant difference with candy-making, and it shouldn't have been off that far when it was brand-new.Then after less than a year of using it once or twice a month for candy or yogurt-making, all of the numbers below 160 are worn off. Given that I mainly use it for making yogurt and need to be able to read 110-115, this is now worthless to me. I'm sure that the other numbers would wear off as well if I typically heated deeper batches of milk/oil/candy.I'm very disappointed in this thermometer. After less than a year, I'm going to have to pitch in the trash. I'm thinking that I'll try a digital thermometer next, as I have yet to find a good \\"normal\\" one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incomplete Madness","review":"This CD is not a complete collection of Hits.

It allowed me to wiggle around the little metal flaps under the key, and with great patience, put the letter back on the keyboard. Wow. I'm impressed.

It is easy to sit back and observe these stories dispassionately, because they lack any passion.The closest Mr. Hammer comes to providing a true continuataion of Doyle's writing is in the last, best and longest of the stories, \\"The Matter of the Furnival Curse\\". It is in this story that the characters come closest to achieving some semblence of humanity.The book is very well presented, but good packaging doesn't make up for a lack of substantial content."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite childhood classic","review":"I always read this book when I needed a pick me up, and I have never known a young girl who hasn't taken flights of fancy just like Alice and knew them to be real.

Her characters easily become a part of you, the images she portrays of Ireland with its rich and tragic heritage course through your heart and mind long after the book has been put down.Great things are to be seen from this talented author, this spinner of tales, this conjuror of emotions.

It continues to be a favorite poem of mine. So I was interested in this book. Oh my - ages 4-8, really? The spider is morphed into a creepy villian, and the fly is of course a sweet innocent young girl. I understand the authors intent, to teach children about falling into traps. But I think kids get that just fine without anthromophizing the characters. The illustrations are fantastic, and I can see children a little older loving the creepiness (maybe 8 and up).

Now to set the record straight I love teenage sex comedies. However, a boy making love to a PB&J is not in my realm of humor. Toss in a dog and his brother filming the event and I am out the door. The movie missed a golden opportunity in The Book of Love. It attempted to reunite certain characters from the past to the present. We had Booger, from the classic \\"Revenge of the Nerds\\" as a teacher and Rosanna Arquette from \\"Amazon Women on the Moon.\\" This should have been a parade of champions from past teenage sex comedies, instead we just get a few to tempt us. Nudity, sexual situations and non-stop crude sex language. Degrading to women, men, and dogs. Funny at times but not worth the coin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carbon copy of the first one","review":"I'm a huge fan of the American Pie series, and have always bought them as soon as they came out. I disagree with those that say it was going downhill; I loved 5 and 6. But this is a new exercise in pathetic. It is literally a carbon copy of the first one, right down to the characters:Rob=JimNathan=KevinLube=FinchStifler=StiflerThe script has a couple new gags in it, including the titular encounter with the legendary Bible from #1, which is the only interesting part. Other gags include an unfortunate encounter with an elderly Canadian hooker, and an even more unfortunate encounter with a moose. These gags are so far over the top they're not even funny. The premise of the movie as a whole is literally the EXACT same thing as #1.The series was awesome, but I guess it had to come to an end eventually. It truly pains me to say it, but if they come out with #8, I'll rent it before I buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Typical American Pie","review":"I love the American Pie movies... I was excited about this being another great movie.... well, I was saddly disappointed with it... I gave it two stars out of pitty..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best one since the first American Pie","review":"The goal in creating yet another American Pie movie was to bring back the heart and emotion of the original movies. Yes, the comedy is outrageous and sometimes totally shocking, but what separates Book of Love from the more recent entries in the franchise is that you actually care about these characters. The fans will be pleasantly surprised at how good this movie actually is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Despite the fact that we are now on the 7th American Pie film, there is still a certain standard that needs to be lived up to. While these films have not been very good since the first trilogy, they have still managed to be juvenile and raunchy fun. Book of Love managed to be juvenile and raunchy, but not fun or good. In the Delta House and Naked Mile, we were left with characters that were fun to watch and the stunts that occurred left for an entertaining movie. Instead, I cringed throughout the newest installment with how unfunny the jokes were and how often I had seen them before. While these films are supposed to be fun and crazy, I expect them to be entertaining also. This wound up easily being the worst one in this series, which was disappointing, as Delta House was the best movie since the first three.Stiffler and the British girl were awful characters also."},{"rating":"2","title":"usual american pie","review":"Played great!

From the heist at the beginning to the cute ending with Tim Allen, the movie is just easy to enjoy. I add it to my list of favorite sleepers--those movies that you know absolutely nothing about, but rent anyway, and then it charms your pants off! Every character in the show is interesting! My best review comment is that I just had fun watching it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth finding out who he is!","review":"Not a bad movie at all, despite what most reviewers have said. It mixes a jewel heist, a romance, and my personal favorite - a case of mistaken identity. Christian Slater plays an escaped convict, Trevor Finch, who takes the name of a tabloid photographer, one Cletis Tout. Unfortunately, poor Mr. Tout has just been rubbed out by a Mafia hit man, and now the Mafia thinks they have the wrong man. When the first two hit men fail to take out Finch, they call in Critical Jim (Tim Allen), who, by his own admission, has two great loves - his job and Hollywood films. And apparently, he's got a photographic memory for the latter.One of the most unique movies I've seen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An amusing film...","review":"Trevor Finch's (Christian Slater) life is hanging by a thread as he is taken hostage by Jim (Tim Allen), a skilled hitman. Jim is a serious enthusiast of classic cinema as he uses lines from different films and complains about the missing magic in current films as he awaits the call for Tout's extermination. During the wait Finch begins a long story that has a jewel heist, prison escape, beautiful woman, and much more. The story hooks Jim as he learns about a mistaken identity that might prolong Finch's life. Who is Cletis Tout is a well-written story with much film history that amuses as it contains both suspense and adventure to keep most audiences entertained."},{"rating":"2","title":"what a find!","review":"I had never seen this movie mentioned anywhere in theaters or DVD. I loved Tim Allen as a hit man. That alone makes the movie worth watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A messy circus","review":"This is just another case where a movie was aiming towards originality, only to overwhelm you with gimmicks! It seems as if every single character in this film came from a comic book: Make way for \\"The Smart-Assed Convict!\\" \\"The Thieving Illusionist!\\" \\"The Essential Love Interest!\\", \\"The Bumbling Pop Culture Spouting Hitmen Duo!\\" \\"The Very Homosexual Neighbor!\\" \\"The Witty Foresnic Examiner\\"! and don't forget \\"The Classic Movie Obsessed Hitman!\\" (by the way, Tim Allen's hitman has got to be the most irritating character in the history of film.) I walked out of the theater after RuPaul's appearence and before they introduce \\"The Flying Zambinos\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as bad as they say it is.","review":"Who is Cletis Tout? isn't as bad as they say.

The pictures are fantastic and there is lots of interesting history and comments on the weapons development and such. The color photos are amazing. I found it very interesting how the author broke up the development by design bureau. I paid alot more at the book store than what Amazon is asking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"He is laughing at us...","review":"Not with us. I can't help but feel that Kundera was in need of some extra money, penned this book one drunken weekend, and offered it to Kundera fans with the excuse \\"it's a divertimento.\\" That body part his character compares to the moon--well that's what he was thinking of us readers.Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's not worthy","review":"It seems that Milan Kundera himself should not be worthy of such bad fiction. This review is written by a girl who has read anything Kundera has ever written and who has loved every sentence, phrase, comma and semi-colon. SLOWNESS gives us a strange kind of vulgarity which never transposes into an elegant, laughable, unbearably light, immortal sensuality. Yes, this book was certainly a page-turner because I was trying to finish it as soon as I could. I have often accused Kundera of recycling the same ideas between his fiction and his essays (even here the lines are blurred), but at least these ideas were profoundly original and witty and full of fictional talent. SLOWNESS was short and slow. It missed the mark, at least for this reader. As we say in French, \\"dommage.\\" (Too bad)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensive Content","review":"This book is very offensive, the language is vulgar (to say the least) and then there is the sexual acts portrayed. My husband & I are offended that this book was even recommended (for a class assignment) to be read - it was such a waste of time & energy! Some feel that adults can handle this content, but being an adult hasn't change my morals."},{"rating":"1","title":"His worst offering","review":"A bad Kundera is still better than most. But this is a regrettable book. Kundera's worst aspects are all on ample display here: his clumsy, if not indifferent, depictions of women; the valorization of the sexual conquest (coupled with degradation here); and his philosophical and historical musings. At his best, Kundera makes these weaknesses into a plus. (Don't ask me how but they work.) Here, these qualities are all parts of a carnival of pathos.It is as if Kundera decided to write the appendix to 'Immortality.' But this time around the structure isn't so surprising. The originality is, the second time around, presented as farce."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kundera is a solid intellectual","review":"If you are amused by thought and thinking then the works of Milan Kundera are for you. All the stuff that is flowing through your mind in observing the world turns up on the pages of his novels. I especially enjoyed \\"Slowness\\" in its discussion of how people with quiet voices have trouble fitting into social situations with all those loud voices dominating. Yes, it hits close to home."},{"rating":"1","title":"A cheap program with some big gotcha's","review":"Sure, this program is [cheap] compared to [the expensive] Movie Magic Screenwriter 2000 or Final Draft, but this program is so loaded with technical glitches and gotchas that I can't recommend it unless you're planning to write and print a single short screenplay for a school assignment or something like that. The documentation says you can export your text into other programs, but you can't! So whatever you write is locked into this limited-feature program forever, unless you want to retype it all. There are lots of other things promised by the manual or box cover but not delivered in the program. If you have any fantasies of actually writing and selling a screenplay, don't buy this product. Save your money and buy one of the industry standard programs instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"very dissatisfied with product","review":"Having to put the disk in each time I want to launch is a major pain and buyers should be warned of this unusual requirement. For those who travel, it is really a nuisance.But my biggest issue is I can't get the program to start up half the time. I am spending more time with tech support than writing. And I have little enough time for that as it is. I thought the program was going to save me time. It hasn't and, at the moment, I've lost an entire script, which I cannot access."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy this!","review":"You need the disk in order to use this program, which means... it's completely useless!

It's not very intuitive, lacks a clear description of the elements and has limited help functions. I am used to using MS Word and found this very frustrating. I just wanted a simple program without all the bells and whistles of the more expensive products, but am disappointed in this. Perhaps it could be different if I was starting from scratch and hadn't imported my script."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Aware. Be Very Aware!","review":"I returned this item because the manufacturer takes great pains to keep secret the fact that the application will not work unless you insert the CD every time you start the program. Not every time you want to install or modify the program, every time you want to use it.Aside from the ethical questions this raises, it is infuriatingly inconvenient. The fact that this \\"feature\\" is nowhere mentioned on the packaging or in the company's advertising -- perhaps because no one would buy it if they knew? -- made me wonder what other surprises await the customer. I decided not to find out.If you are a serious writer, you could create your own screenwriting template in a word processing application for free in a fraction of the time you will eventually spend fetching the CD, inserting the CD, waiting for the program to recognize the CD, removing the CD and filing the CD every single time you want to use this program."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth The Aggravation!","review":"Please, please, please, do yourself a big favor and save your pennies, stand on the street corner if you have to and take donations and buy Final Draft. Sometimes when you pay less you don't get a bargain, you get a lot of headaches which is exactly what this program is. THE TECHNICAL SUPPORT IS EXCELLENT. I feel sorry for them because it takes both: a good product and good tech support. This does not format stage plays professionally. If you're like me, you don't have the time for all of this aggravation. Spend your money on the professional quality programs, work like a professional and spend the extra time that you're not being aggravated perfecting your craft. I'm giving it 2 stars for the tech support."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hollywood Screenwriter: An Efficient and Time Saving CD","review":"This CD will help both amatuer and professional screenwriter type faster with less interruption from margin settings.

This is the book that inspired me to make romance writing my hobby. I've read this book so many times that the pages are falling apart. Amazing and believable characters, Anita Mills pulls you into the story. Eleanor, the most beautiful and sought after woman in Normandy, Roger her one and true love. Both fighting against king, church and family to be together. Action, adventure, twists, turns, chivalry, knights, honor, good against evil and in the midst of the chaos is the indominable love and intense passion between Eleanor and Roger.

A must buy and a must keep forever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all-time favorites!!!!","review":"I have had this book and the rest of the Fire series for nearly nine years.

If you want a kite to fly, save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful!","review":"The braided-rubber design is brilliant---very easy to attach things securely without carrying around extra clothespins. Used this for a 2-week trip through Europe (washing clothes daily and hanging them to dry overnight), and it was perfect. The velcro hoops make it easy to attach, and stable, unlike suction cups. A small product, but one that does its job perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too short to do much good","review":"Good idea in theory, but it is too short to span any area much to work. They might think about selling it longer (charging more of course). You could always tie a knot in it to then adjust it. Maybe two together would work? Velcro at ends good idea. Did not work well for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rick Steves Clothesline, Natural","review":"This item is exactly like the one on the RS website. We used this on our trip to Italy. It came in very handy to hold our laundered items and not drape them over expensive furniture to dry. Because it stretches you don't need clothespins. It just tucks in between the braiding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful clothesline","review":"In order to carry just two small carry-ons and a briefcase for our 3-week trip to Spain, we needed a reliable, easy-to- use clothesline to keep ourselves in clean clothes. This did the trick in 3 of the 4 hotels where we stayed. One hotel had absolutely no safe place on which to string the clothesline. The velcro fasteners worked well to keep the line up. The design calls for tucking the edges of clothes between the braids of the line and also worked well. If you want to travel light and still smell good on the way, this is a useful tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"great concept, didn't last long","review":"Overall, out of the box this product worked great. After 1 month use, the bands disintegrated (crumbled into bits). I had it placed under a pagoda (partially shaded). It was occasionally used - so I am sure that the failure wasn't due to abuse. It appeared that the portion of the bands that failed most severely had more frequent exposure to sun. I live a few blocks from the beach in San Diego, so maybe salt air was a factor? Only my cycling clothes were hung on the line (no heavy towels or rags with chemicals). If the band material was more UV-resistant, this would be a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect clothesline","review":"Our 9 day trip involved activities that kept you wet so I washed out our clothes every night in the shower and then easily attached one end of the clothes line to the curtain rod and the other end to the edge of a table. The AC blew clothes dry overnight. It's so small and handy that I overlooked it in my room in Costa Rica! Someone else is fortunate enough to use it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for travel","review":"Works well for hanging. The velcro is strong and seems to hold well at difference tensions and different stretch distances. It's a little bit of a chore to pull the chord apart to hold the clothes, but they stay in tight and don't fall. Well made and should last a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Convenient","review":"Took this on our trip to Italy. It was wonderful to have something to hang our washed clothes on.

However, it has one design flaw, which is that both ends terminate with open loops. One end can be secured to a towel bar by leading the line through the eye of the loop on one end. But, this means that the bathroom needs have at least one post over which the loop on the other end can slip over to be anchored. Bathrooms we stayed in lacked such a post, so to secure the second end we had to use a pen to secure it. A hook on the second end would have been more versatile."},{"rating":"1","title":"ERROR","review":"I wanted a line that would suction to the walls. I'm not sure if the error is mine or yours. What can I do about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed in winter","review":"I left this outside in winter for a few days and the rubber thoroughly cracked and disintegrated leaving it unusable. For warm weather only. I expect better durability from a simple clothesline.Edit: To the response saying this is for hotel rooms indoors, I think it's quite common to hang clothes on a balcony."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong clothesline, worth the extra money","review":"Don't be fooled by cheaper suction cup knockoffs. Suction cup clotheslines won't hold a wet sock! You have to tie the ends down either way so why not have a strong line that is designed to be tied. The braided feature allows you to do without clothespins because you can pinch your clothing in between the braids... Although I always throw things over the top. This line is worth the extra dough and will help keep your luggage weight down. I suggest buying some Woolite packets as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"was mine defective?","review":"This clothesline was terribly disappointing.

Perhaps mine was defective?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good travel item","review":"I travel light, which means laundry. To forgo the pleasure of clothespins, I take this line. It has worked well on 4 major trips now. With a very small load of laundry (my usual every-other-night wash) it is fine. For larger loads I add an \\"extender.\\" In the past it was a bit of cord, but I now use a 60 inch web belt (which has several other uses when I travel.) The belt allows me to attach the clothesline in (so far) any hotel and extends the line for large loads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"Too short, no hooks and/or suction cups at the ends. The loops were not helpful in setting up. Most importantly, it was just too short. We brought one other line which we ended up using becuase it was better constructed (longer, suction cups AND clips). I would not recommend this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for travel","review":"A very strong and durable clothesline. I searched around for a good quality one for an extended month long trip to europe where I was bringing just a carryon bag. This worked great!

I wouldn't travel without this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummm...did not work","review":"I read the amazing reviews for this clothesline and purchased it to use on my month long European adventure.Sadly, this clothesline was terrible and didn't do anything it was supposed to do.

I had T-mobile but got tired of thier lousy coverage, so I got AT&T, who was a great provider. Now cigular owns me and they don't honor thier rollover plan, and my free services disappear monthly. Also, cigular loves to rob you if you need a new phone, no discounts or promotions, just full retail.

The flashing light is not on top as shown in the photo, but is inside the base, illuminating the entire cone from the inside. I find the flashing light to be an unnecessary feature, but perhaps it is a draw for some people. The cone itself is a good size and seems sturdy with decent reflective tape. I purchased 3 of these in order to examine them more closely. I then decided to buy some additional cones, but discovered that the price had doubled from $10.19 to over $20.00 per cone. I would recommend that this cone is a bargain at $10.19, but not worth double the money, hence my recommendation dropped from 5 to 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"i was disappointed","review":"when i was going through the pictures i saw the gshock box but it doesnot come with that box and also the watch looks cheap"},{"rating":"2","title":"casio dw290","review":"Have had this watch for years and like it so well I keep buying the same. When the band failed on my old one it was almost as cheap to buy the new watch versus a replacement band. Best deal around.

Not something that I would normally use anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent daily use watch","review":"Well there is no much to say but is good looking not so big not tinny, i like the shape too, very though even the crystal not even one scratch in 2 months and im not the kind of ppl who cares about not banging my watch if im doing manual work, im a diver too so i attached to it a little rubber compass on the band and have been took it to 60 feet and perfect, zero complains, i have more expensive ones but for daily use i preffer this one, only downside is that green letters are starting to fade, all of them, the electroluminiscence, illuminator, water resist and 200m letters, so i expect they are gonne in some months but i like the watch without them too so for me is ok, btw, i dont like the look of the protective wrap of g shocks thats why i bouhgth this one, recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Casio is my favorite brand","review":"This watch is a nice watch, and I am happy with it so far. I do have a tough time reading the digital readout on it sometimes, but my eyes are not what they once were. In my earlier days, I always would buy a G Shock or Pathfinder, as they are really more my style, but I always ended up giving these to my sons after years of happy use. Now days, these $20 type watches are all I need, and they work great, if not for the durability factor, I would give them a five star rating, but again for a little more than $20, not anything to worry about."},{"rating":"1","title":"reflection on the vendor, not the product","review":"The watch is actually pretty nice for the price. However it is not a real g shock as shown in the picture And stated in title. Box is regular Casio and bevel on the face is not raised like g shocks.

Just not what was stated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality for little money","review":"I use the countdown timer multiple times daily, so the non-recessed buttons are very convenient.

I would recommend this watch for anyone who wants something sporty,waterproof, durable, dependable, and wont get knicked up. I know this one is not quite as tough as my Gshocks, so as a result I always keep that in mind as to how I treat it. But I dont baby it either. For $26 and free shipping, you cant go wrong. I have had it 9 months so far and it works excellent. When I need a battery, Walmart has them for $3 , including changing it for me (no charge).

I already love it. We have a huge slow cooker big enough for roasts and such, but for my husband and me it is just too large for everyday use. Not this one - perfect size for smaller quantities of food or side dishes. I love that the ceramic dish is easy to clean and can go right to the table. So far we have made steel cut oatmeal, tapioca pudding, applesauce, and spinach artichoke dip. Much more to come, we've had it for only days. I have two criticisms. 1. The cord is a little short, which doesn't allow it to be in the center or closer to us on the counter. 2. No lights for cook status (just a little orange light would be perfect so we know which setting it is on). I hope it is durable over time but for under $20, I think it's hard to go wrong with this cooker."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST VALUE","review":"THIS IS THE BEST SMALL CROCK POT WITH THE MOST FEATURES AVAILABLE.

I'm trying to incorporate more whole grains and legumes into our diet and this little cooker is wonderful for cooking up a batch of quinoa or lentils. I can load it at lunchtime, and the meal is ready four hours later. The small size is perfect for one quart soup recipes and things seem to cook very evenly. I'm especially looking forward to having it around this summer, to cook grains for salads without heating up the kitchen. The removable crock is great, and as long as I remember to spray it with cooking spray, clean up is a breeze.The lack of an indicator light doesn't bother me. It heats up quickly and I can tell when it's on. Fewer things to go wrong, is my motto. I have a harvest gold crockpot from the 1970s that still works fine, and I expect this one to last just as long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Working ability!","review":"It works perfectly and is the perfect size!

So we bought this, and it's done a great job for us. The one complaint I have is the insulation. There is none. The first time I cooked with it I went to open it (which involves unhooking a rubber band that holds down the top) and burned myself on the side of the crock. Badly. Since then I've burned myself one other time, though that one was a fluke (looking away while reaching for something else). Had I known about this I probably would have kept looking for one that has some kind of insulation, but it does such a good job I'm just going to try to always remember it wants to burn my fingers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emphasis on \\"Slow\\"","review":"Temperature settings on this cooker don't seem to work. Or maybe something is wrong with mine. High never brings liquid to a boil. I put a stew on high, but 5 hours later, the potatoes and veggies are still rock hard. The broth isn't getting hot enough to cook anything.In my large, old 1960s slow cooker, high means boiling in a few minutes. I guess I'm going to have to transfer this stew into the old cooker if I want any dinner tonight.I like the small size and easy clean up of the 1.5 qt Proctor Silex, but maybe it's only good for overnight oatmeal and keeping sauces warm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this slow cooker","review":"I love this little mini crock pot.

One upstairs and one downstairs. Set them to low and let them go. Just remember to put water in them and turn them off when leaving the floor for the day/night. Our only complaint is that the lids tend to rattle around when the water level is too high and steam is escaping. That only happens when the pots are on high for too long."},{"rating":"2","title":"A marvelous little unit","review":"I was looking for small, and this was the smallest I saw. The heat control offers several heat settings, and the cord is long enough to make it to the outlet on my counter. I wanted a quality appliance for heating pickling solution for metalworking, and this fits the bill. Its only drawback for this specialized application is the beautiful steel rim on the pyrex lid, which is adverse for the particular solution I use. But for the price and the quality of the rest of the appliance, I'm thrilled. Besides, if I were using it for anything else I'd want that nice steel band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"I did some research before I purchased this item.

It's $20 and it's basic (no power light for example, which feels odd for any kitchen device) but it has a good quality internal white ceramic pot and glass lid. Three settings - keep warm, low, and high - and nothing else (no timer, no automatic way to switch from cook to keep warm). I had read that some slow cooker lids rattle while they're cooking, but happily that problem did not show up, on low cooking anyway. I cooked a meal for eight hours, and it did not show any signs of drying out, so I think it will be fine for leaving on low heat during the work day. The internal pot lifts out for serving, and it cleaned up immediately I put it in hot soapy water. Size is fine for two or three servings. I'm now kind of glad I could not get the Breville slow cooker (good reviews but much bigger, and out of production) and opted for this because it's small and simple but it does the job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Buy","review":"I just bought this little crockpot because I am downsizing and needed a crockpot that was more suited to meals for 1 or 2 people. I have only used it once and that was to cook steel cut oatmeal. It was amazing to get up this morning and have hot oatmeal ready to eat. Before I went to bed, I LIGHTLY buttered the inside of the crock, added 4 cups water, 1 cup steel cut oats and about 1/2 teaspoon of salt. I turned it on LOW and when I got up this morning, I had a crock full of excellent oatmeal. I think as I learn to adapt more recipes to this small crock, it will become my favorite appliance. I can already see cooking soups and stews in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product.","review":"I was looking for a small crock pot with Hi, Lo, and Warm setting. This crockpot is perfect for cooking Steel Cut Oats overnight. Breakfast ready when you get up. I cooked Steel Cut Oats on low for 7 hours and it was beginning to scorch just a little on one side. Not enough that it affected the oats though. I don't know how it would do if you cooked it any longer. Just right for serving two persons. This is the reason that I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"love to cook","review":"I love this little slow cooker. I live alone and it is wonderful to come home to a homemade meal ready for me.

She has used it at least a half dozen times since Christmas and is very pleased with it. The metallic ring on the outside, beneath the lid ring, gets very hot, so be careful.

Since she lives alone, she likes the smaller sized slow cooker. She has used it several times and thinks it works great. She also appreciates being able to remove the liner for serving and washing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The little crock pot that delivers big","review":"I bought this crock pot for $15, which turned out to be a good value in the end. I just wanted something simple to cook a meal for two. I now use it at least twice a week for making simple to complex meals. This handy cooker has three main settings-low, high and keep warm heat. The removable crock also doubles as a serving dish; and can go straight from the table to the refrigerator to store leftovers with quick convenience. The smaller crock pots are popularly used for oatmeal, dips, chilli and soup. However, since buying this crock pot, I've experimented with different types of dishes. If you purchase this product on Amazon, I highly recommend buying it with these other complementary cook books: \\"Not Your Mother's Slow Cooker Recipes For Two\\" and \\"350 Big Taste Recipes For the 1.5 Quart Mini Slow Cooker.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Slow Cooker For A Single Person","review":"I only recently discovered that mini slow cookers even exist. My other crock pot is quite large and although I like it very much I end up with enough food to feed a football team so I did a Google search and discovered that the Proctor Silex 1-1/2 quart got good reviews and was the right size. I had no problems whatsoever with this product, it cooks just as well as the larger models, it's easy to clean, and it hardly takes up any space in my rather small kitchen so I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for small cooking :)","review":"So far I have made a few things in this little pot and love it.

The sixth symphony is the ultimate in Sibelius' quest to serve up \\"cold, clear water\\" in musical form. Most conductors do not have a clue, but Paavo Berglund and his relatively small orchestra achieve the maximum impact by adhering strictly to the score. Think \\"Winter\\" and the composer's intentions will become crystal clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great playing and recording; bland interpretation","review":"I would recommend this CD to a student studying the score and wishing to hear as many of the instrumental lines as possible, but not to anyone else. The Chamber Orchestra of Europe is an absolutely first-class ensemble, and its playing is caught superbly by Finlandia's engineers. I just wish that Berglund's conducting lived up to the standard set by the playing and recording. Unfortunately, as thoughout this cycle, he seems to be going dourly through the motions, offering not even a glimpse of Sibelius's genius. I would suggest Bernstein/NYPO/Sony in the Sixth Symphony, and Maazel/VPO/Decca Legends in the Fourth, for thrilling stereo interpretations of these symphonies. If you want to hear a Finnish conductor, try Osmo Vänskä on BIS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great disc for fans of musicals","review":"This disc contains 12 real show stoppers. Only the most dedicated (fanatical?) collector is likely to have all the original albums already and there's great stuff here.

I've really missed this score.Since enjoying a production of The Boy Friend back in the 70's, Sandy Wilson is one of my favorite theater songwriters. The Buccaneer is a really fun score (Unromantic Us is a wonderful song!). Another obscure Wilson score I highly recommend is Valmouth (the original production with the great Cleo Laine).It's really nice to have this score available in a digital format."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced pamphlet","review":"I should have read the description more carefully before ordering, but I did not; therefore I accept the responsibility.

The real kicker is that the species featured are among the least difficult to identify.

By approaching the Song of Songs from the perspective of longing, as illustrated by a woman longing for her beloved, Ernst has shed light on the the nature of divine longing, much in the tradition of the poetry of Rumi and other Sufi poets. In her eloquent commentary (which nicely intersperses the biblical text, so that one is not flipping back and forth constantly), Ernst places the Song of Songs into a broad cultural context, which allows for a meditation on the universality of the ideas expressed in the Song. An elegant gem of a book that can be savored for a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial!","review":"I have read many Song of Songs interpretations online (for free) that were interesting and in depth. This book, on the other hand, is nothing more than a slight tweak of the King James Version (with a few lovely paintings) with commentary that is nothing more than a bunch of \\"maybe it means this, or maybe it means that...\\" ...none of which is backed up with research or shows any kind of depth of knowledge about the Songs. I am no academician to be sure, just a \\"regular person\\" who was sorely disappointed by how superficial this book was."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Willie's best efforts. Simply amazing!","review":"Willie Nelson's records have so much meaning to them. Even his compilations have meaning. I rarely see a bad Willie collection. But, his record 'Phases and Stages' is probably one of the best.Released on Atlantic way back in 1974, the record evolves around Willie's crumbling marriage. There is something about this record that just is really charming. I don't know what it is, but it's one of my favorites.I like the opening song, 'Washing The Dishes' a whole lot. It's got powerful country vocals as only Willie can sing.The real highlight for me is either 'Bloody Mary Morning' or 'No Love Around.' This is sort of the pre-'Red Headed Stranger' record. This and 'Shotgun Willie' were among the few releases he made for the Atlantic label. He swapped labels a year later and cut 'Red Headed Stranger' that same year, 1975.This will take you back awhile. It's like a trip down memory lane. Highly recommended. Truly one of his best records."},{"rating":"2","title":"What A Themematic Album Should Ought To Be","review":"Long before Red Headed Stranger Willie concieved of this themeatic work and WoooooooooooooooEeeeeeeeeeeeeee This one sure as hell works from start to finish.

Yes we all know Pasolini went berserk, and let it rest there. Don't touch this, folks. Decent people need to force our culture and community to bury this kind of absolute degradation and keep it buried."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is awful.","review":"This movie sucks, don't see it. I really wish I would have streamed this film before I paid $18 for it. I wanted to see this movie simply because I refused to believe it was as disgusting and horrible as everyone seems to say it is. Short answer is it's not, it's just stupid. I get that it's supposed to be an artsy movie and a graphic analogy for fascism or whatever but that doesn't mean it's a movie worth watching. The only redemptive quality it had was almost putting me to sleep because of how extremely boring and bland it is. Full to the brim with bad acting, bad dialogue, and bad \\"special effects\\". What a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't see this movie","review":"I rented this movie based on reviews that stated it was thought provoking and deep. I didn't see anything in this garbage heap that was intelligent or art. I don't know how this movie is not banned in the USA, the movie has underage actors naked the whole movie being sodomized and no other plot lines.Just because a film or video is made by a famous director or studio doesn't mean it cannot be labeled as underage pornography. This movie made me cringe for one simple reason and that is people actually enjoyed watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"So this is what we have come to.","review":"David Cronenberg's film Videodrome was right: pretty soon people will be wanting to watch movies of pure torture, with no redeeming values what so ever. Im sure I'll get o out of 137 people finding this review helpful, and that sickens me. In my opinion, movies like this are bad for your mind. The whole movie is a bunch of innocent teenagers being torured, raped, molested, disembowled, and wirse things of which I won't even describe. I can't believe people enjoy this movie. Im not trying to insult anyone, im just trying to get people to realize that they are enjoying a movie about kids being tortured and sodomized. Im not some fanatical christian, or over protective parent, Im just a college kid whose worried about what movies like this do to people's minds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing","review":"The enigmatic Pier Paolo Pasolini final piece of work was quite the statement. Pasolini was man not afraid to state his views and did so rather grotesquely in Salo. A film which was difficult to \`digest' did have some underlying meaning. Pasolini successfully was able to show the harsh reality of living under a fascist regime and how it feels to be controlled. A fervent Marxist, Pasolini made a political statement in the film and also tried to show the disintegration of society's values. So to put it lightly the film was filled meaning, but the manner in which his message is portrayed is disturbing to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this movie but still buying this movie","review":"I saw this movie long long time ago.I didn't felt disgusting. I have a strong stomach, so.But I hated it.There's no meaning I thought watching this film.But anyway I am purchaging it.You know why?I donno.I know what the pasism and all and can apply to this movie but still don't liked the film.The picture quality is very good although my pirate version was good too.IS it worth buying it? You decide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality of film is not high","review":"Once you get over the highly sadistic components of this film, I question its real artisitc value. For example, I did not think it made good use of the sets and props. The dialogue in English seem very stilted (that may be a result of the translation) and at times the audio (in the original Iralian) was missing altogether (problem with my copy?). Bottom line, it achieves the purpose of exposing humanity at its worst but does not draw you in as I expected from Italian films I have seen before."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Just Don't Know","review":"The movie held my interest, but the only reason why was to see what sick thing would happen next. Like more horror movies the further it went the sicker it got and its one of those kinda movies that when its over you feel you need to smoke a pack of cigarettes and take a shower. It makes you feel like your just not clean. If I was asked if I would recremend this to someone else I doubt I would."},{"rating":"2","title":"My review","review":"Not really what i thought the movie would be when i bought it.

Of course, taste is very subjective, but i can't imagine this video content would appeal to very many people. just my two cents,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable package","review":"This 2nd Criterion release is a serious upgrade from the previous release. I was surprised by the package when I first opened it. It is quite substantial. You get 2 DVDs and a 80 page book that includes photographs and text explaining the history behind the movie. The DVDs sit in a package that is also wrapped with photos from the movie. The video quality also seems like a nice boost from the original that I remember. To date, this is my favorite Criterion release and I hope they continue to release more packages like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glorifying the Dirt","review":"Allegoristic,Decameron-style movie materializesDante\`s seven cycles of hell on the Earth in Italian province of Salo, in 1944.Top dignitaries picked up eighteen circa 15-year-old male and female offspring of local noticeable citizens to fulfill their sexual fantasies by de Sad's way -seeSex and Sadismfor instance.Producers had succeeded to quite explicitly exhibit characters' motto and goals of glorifying the most dirt of humankind even by less profound screening thanHostel (Director's Cut)andFriskdid.Unforgettable work banned from shop shelves in Australia is a sure intelligent classic of its genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"This movie was unfortunately something I will never watch again, it's too strong for me, thought it would be a walk in the park considering iv'e seen plenty of scary movies. But this one will be in my collection, will never let friends, or family watch, borrow, nor will i have a discussion about this film ever, i gave it 5 stars just because of the fact that no other film compares to it, it's in its own class of Disturbing, it really plays with your mind, emotions, and you can't bare to have a feeling of disgust. If you watch it, do not eat directly before or after this film, just trust me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deeper Thought Required","review":"I am fond of this film, and I highly recommend this movie to those who wish to head-on challenge their sensibilities. Also, those who wish to think. The major content of this movie is a real slap in the face, but it's important to understand the underlying allegory, which I'm not as well-equipped as others to explain. Maybe read more about it in warning, then keep the most open mind possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"120 Minutes of Junk","review":"You can try to defend this movie all your want, for being misunderstood and wrongly accused of exploitation. But this movie is junk. Maybe it has a great meaning to you, but for a meaning like that to be effective, the movie first has to be good. This film is nowhere near being a great film. Start with the acting..And if you're watching this specifically to be grossed out, it may not even happen. This film is not as graphic as one may make it seem. It's the overall feeling you get once the movie's over that makes you want to crawl into a hole. Watch Cannibal Holocaust if you want something gut-wrenching. Watch Salo if you enjoy watching 16-year-old boys getting sodomized for 2 hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have no respect for this film.No stars.","review":"Why should I have any respect for a film that is as pointless as watching a dog chew a bone?People who have seen the film tell me that Pasolini made the film to show the true ways of our human nature and how bad people can be.What a bunch of crock!This is the most violating and sickest film I have seen.Hey,I like watching graphic films but I have my limits and this film goes way over that limit.\\"Salo,or the 120 Days of Sodom\\" is worthless,pointless,violating and the most trashiest,sleaziest sickest film ever made.Who cares if Pasolini was an artist.I have no respect for this film or Pasolini.How can I after what I have seen.I rather be strapped to a chair and be forced to watch \\"Battlefield Earth\\" repeatly.Another film that I didn't like.[...]God,I hate this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well...","review":"I saw this movie many years ago.

Many reviewers have gone to great lengths (very, very great lengths in some cases) to paint this film as a masterpiece. It's not. Rife with symbolism and chocked full of metaphors, the movie is a condemnation of society as Pasolini saw it. Okay, I \\"get\\" it -- but while the images are graphic and disturbing, ultimately it's the poorly conceived and executed film that is the biggest shock. As a curiosity you might want to rent it."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrifying/appalling/nauseating","review":"I ordered DVD based on review in major weekly magazine...i am not thin-skinned, overly sensitive, or prudish but i could not make it even half way thru this movie.Movie contains graphic scenes of extremely deviant sexual behavior and abuse."},{"rating":"1","title":"How this thing gets (90) 5 star ratings i will never understand ...","review":"There are no words for this film. If there's something to learn from it, i don't see how consuming feces and just ridiculous behavior teaches anything in the first place. It shows the sick mentality of some people in this world. Well that's what i get for being curious ... i mean don't get me wrong i enjoy watching some pretty off the wall movies from time to time like Hostel for instance, but this one Salo did cross the line. I didn't get the plot if there was one, and i don't get the stupidity either, sorry. I guess you must be some type of philosophy genius or something to get it, like those significant amount of 5 star reviewers out there. To each it's own i guess ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Sickening!","review":"I rented Saló after reading the reviews on both Netflix and Amazon.com. I thought I was getting a visually stunning, mind opening, erotic masterpiece. What I saw was one of the most disturbing moves ever made. It is sick, twisted and demented to say the least. There is nothing erotic about this movie at all; there is nothing beautiful about this movie at all. I do not believe in censorship and anyone has the right to make a movie on any subject but I do have the right to say this is just not for me and I personally found Saló sickening. I would not recommend this movie to anyone and in fact warned my wife not to watch it because I knew it would make her ill. Please be aware of what you are getting if you buy or rent this movie. I will add my very short synopsis of the movie, a bunch or sick freaks, kidnap and torture some poor young people, with some rape, and murder thrown in."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISGUSTING!","review":"Dont take me wrong, I DO like classic movies, european, and experimental cinema, and I like Sade's books a lot, I think Justine is a masterpiece, but this movie [stinks], I dont mind violence and disturbing images, but come on, all that has to come to a conclusion, leave a lesson, but this movie leaves nothing, maybe it will leave you a \\"I want to vomit\\" sensation..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Salo","review":"I don't get it. Judging from the reviews, some people actually like this movie, or so they say. Well let me tell you what: if you really enjoy this film, that means you're stupid. Unless you're lying to yourself and others, for some reasons, being dumb is your only exuse for praising it.Salo is based on de Sade's book. I've read some parts of it and it was worthless. All it contains is large amounts of boring philosophy, which, I'm sure, no one even bothers to read because it's so dull, and even larger amounts of different abominations that the authors two-dimensional characters do upon each other.The movie is not better. The whole point of it is that the fascists did some bad things. Well duh.So, is this a high class piece of art? My ass. Is it at least as disgusting as they say it is? Yes it is. But if you really need to puke for some reasons, then why don't you just stick two fingers down your throat and save your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"ewwwww","review":"that movie is nasty. that old man who wanted that guy to do him in the stinker at dinner was creepy. i cant believe they ate poo. that movie was worse than hulk with eric bana."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's All the Huh-Bub, Bub?","review":"I'd read alot about Salo before watching it. Every review I'd read proclaimed that it was very profound and that it was the most disturbing film ever made and such. Well, of course you can't rent it anywhere (especially not here in Fairbanks, Alaska), so I had to buy it. While I was watching it, all I could think was \\"Will that darn lady ever shut up?\\" The woman who talks to the kids for most of the movie annoyed the heck out of me. I was bored to tears. I kept waiting for something to happen. The theme of fascism is not completely lost on me, however. When it came time for the infamous \\"feces buffet,\\" it's not depicted very grapically so it wasn't very shocking. The violence in the film is mostly shown at a distance, so the viewer is removed from it. Maybe I missed something, but this movie did not shock, disturb or even interest me in the slightest. Maybe I'm just too jaded."},{"rating":"2","title":"A dramatization of Foucualt's notion of power/sex","review":"It is not surprising that this film appeared in 1970s. While those years seem so far away, they were much more progressive in many regards than 1990s and with no doubt an intellectually- vibrant period. In his books, Michel Foucault unravels the intricate relationships among power, sex, body and establishment. IMHO, Pasolini's Salo is an extreme dramatization of this web. A must-see for literature, humanities and critical theory students!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Especially disturbing for the decade it was released.","review":"Pasolini was murdered by one of the actors who played a captive. After seeing this film you'll know why."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Shuddering Experience","review":"SALO, OR THE 100 DAYS OF SODOM is by far the most harrowing filmic experience I have ever had. Many times I had to stop the DVD just to breathe; most often I was forced to look away at the sight of appalling acts. That the film is a masterpiece, there is no doubt. But it is a masterpiece of degradation and untrammeled sexuality, if, indeed, it can in any way be called sexual.I recommend it only to those who can look at it objectively and see through the grossness of its subject to its masterliness as film art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Copout","review":"Marquis de Sade's tale involved no one over the age of 14 .. the people in this film are all adults! This completely undermines the shock value of this movie. Maybe it is simply dated, as the scenes in the average popcorn flick of today, such as Hostel II, are FAR more realistic and \\"disturbing\\" than this snore-fest. My 12 year old son fell asleep on the couch trying to get through it. (His only comment was a suggestion that if I liked this I should watch a video he has bookmarked call 'two girls and a cup' .. since he says that actually shows what this movie badly fakes .. and that it seems to be popular with the juvenile humor set, I think I will pass).MarthaI will still give it 5 stars, only because I am judging it by other movies of its time, not by todays more tolerant standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not That Disgusting or explict..............","review":"I watched this movie twice and it is not as explict as all these reviews state. Of course most of the people who viewed this movie must not watch very explict movies that is why it is so shocking and controversial to them. Also when the people are forced to eay human manuver you know that this movie is totally fake and not real yes it would be disgusting if it was real but gimme a break people......... Also the Prices are so riduculus for a stupid no depth movie..Who would pay 1,000 for a dvd....Let's get real people.I reccommend renting before buying..Truly a movie for people who like so-called shock o rama.It is not that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep ur money in your wallet","review":"This must have been one of the worst movies i have ever seen.

I got nothing wat soever nothing to even think of looking away from the screen. I thought to myself this film is just more of a werid fantasy of a old deranged man who was beaten and abused as a child.

When I received my disc, there were multiple deep scratches located on the disc. It didn't affect the playability of the movie but it's disappointing considering that this should have arrived in brand new condition. It seems to have been damaged by the manufacturer/packager and not by amazon. I am currently in the process of returning this movie which is quite a hassle considering I'm in Iraq at an APO adddress."},{"rating":"2","title":"Salo","review":"I will sum this up as simply as I can... I love this movie! It's an absolute masterpiece! Not only did I find it mentally stimulating, but also it was one of, if not the most erotically hypnotic movies ever. I can't count how many times I rubbed out a jellyfish on the floor in front of me while watching this masterpiece. I would definitely rate it up there with some of the greats (Citizen Kane, 2001 a Space Odyssey, Forest Gump, etc.). This is one movie that someday will be shown in school classrooms around the world. If you haven't yet seen it, then buy all means buy it. You and your family will not be disappointed, I guarantee it!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brain candy for the damned","review":"In this day and age of snotty teens, what's more entertaining than seeing a bunch of them forced to dine on feces? Salo is a glimpse into the politics of power; it's disturbing only because it forces us to confront our own perverse desires. Given complete control over a group of attractive adolescents, how much differently would anyone behave?"},{"rating":"1","title":"WRONG","review":"Depravity far worse than that depicted in the film exists in the world today, acts far more violent and horrendous. Nonetheless, their representation without any moral standpoint is immoral because it proposes that the morality of extreme violence is up for debate. It simply isn't. Depicting brutality such as this film does without condemning it is to open the possibility that we accept it without thinking, the ultimate in moral perversion. The proper response to watching this film is to stop; to continue is to indulge, and I mean indulge, not explore, the absolute worst elements of the filmmaker and the human beast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plain or peanut?","review":"The title of this review is what I was thinking, when I witnessed the \\"Feast\\". LOL But seriously, I have seen some of the most controversial films ever made. This ranks up there with the best of them. (Or the worst, depending on your point of view) It probably surpasses most, in shock value. Made in the 70s, it still has high shock value, even by today's standards. This movie helps me to better understand why they locked up the Marquis de Sade. If there wasn't so much gay stuff in this unintentional comedy, I may have given it 5 stars.The movie is definitely not for everybody...read allot of reviews, and then decide for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saw","review":"If you've seen Saw, you've seen worse than this. I love Pasolini's Medea, so, when you add in the legendary status this film boasts, I was really looking forward to something amazing. Of course, what was shocking in the pre-Saw, Hostel, etc., etc. world doesn't shock as much anymore. The flat performances do little to help this extremely dated seeming film. While the shot composition was obviously a point of lavish attention, often the tableaux are textbook exercises with no real joy in them - and are even repetitive and predictable. To me the film comes off simply pretentious, flat, poorly acted, and vaguely nauseating in a way that annoys without shocking. Caligula is a much better and even more transgressive film, even without the scat play which figures so prominently in this film. If you're wanting something that titillates, yet is more effective as a tragedy, I would recommend that film instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue Ray not playable in Europe","review":"It is quite incomprehensible that Amazone allows shipment of Blu Ray discs that cannot be played on European Blue Ray Players.

Acts of depravity are commonplace amongst the rich and powerful. We foolishly give up our power to people we trust blindly.

In my opinion it is not. There is no real story line, it just shows how sick and perverted some people are and having the power to fulfill them. The fame of this film is because it got pull-out theaters for being too graphic; but that was back in the 70s, now days I have seen films that are more graphic than this one. It just goes to show how time has change.If you saw the film back when it was in theaters (the 70s), then buy it. It might be of your taste.

So what exactly makes it a masterpiece then? Beats me.Ok, you have to admit that the main reason people watch this is to get shocked, offended and generally freaked out at some of the weird stuff they'll see, but at the end of the day I found it boring. Yes, even the 'distrubing' scenes seemed so over-the-top that they just didn't seem realistic, and after it all ended I felt violated. I felt like someone had come into my house, destroyed my belongings, beat me up, beat up my parents, raped me and made me eat s**t. That's basically what the films about.

If you're into disturbing movies you'll find that this isn't incredible disturbing, if not then be prepared to see things not generally shown in theaters.Here is a quick summary if you're too lazy to read all the other comments (mind you it's been a bit since I've seen it). Four aristocrats decide to take in some men and women play with them, torture them, and kill them. Suppossed this is based on de Sade's 120 days of sodom.HOW TO BUY RARE (SALO) DVD CHEAPDon't pay a ridiculus amount of money for this movie. The first version of this movie I found on tape for $5 on ebay. I recently found a $5-10 dollar DVD version on ebay. From my understanding it's legal to sell this movie since it's unavailable here. As an added note if you're into rare movies I suggest finding a good import site say diabolik or xploited cinema (There's plenty others) or again try ebay.Hope this helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hideous Film!!!","review":"I am very much in favor of uncensored art and allowing artists to realize their visions, regardless of how offensive they may be. But, this film by Pasolini crossed a line for me. It gave totally new meaning to the word \\"gratuitous.\\" It was so replete with violence and depravity that it felt like a meaningless, albeit powerful, assault on my psyche. And for what - to prove what we already know, that Mussolini's fascists were vulgar excuses for human beings? I think films that deliver strong messages through the power of suggestion are much more effective and thought provoking than Passoini's \\"Salo.\\" Don't get me wrong, I certainly thought a great deal about the film after seeing it, but not in an intellectually rigorous way. My thoughts were more focused on how physically ill it made me feel. In fact, I had real trouble sleeping for a couple of weeks after seeing it.

The author even includes a quote in the book that states that those who have no children are \\"useless\\" to society.

What music this is.Unfortunately my favorite, Alma Mia, No. 6 is not available for listening on Amazon. Roughly translated Alma Mia means Soul of Mine. The words alone are simply staggering. The performance on the CD does justice to the magic of Bola's creation. I'm not even a Latin jazz fan and this CD sends me time traveling back to Havana.

Poor Bola must be turning in his grave now that this awful CD is out.

The main problem was her fans, and especially the media, were stuck in a time warp.So while Debbie forged ahead, everyone else was lagging behind, looking for the sound of a 16 year-old kid instead of welcoming the maturing sound of a 20 year-old woman. Shame on us.I listen to \\"Anything Is Possible\\" every now and again and find myself enjoying it just as much \\"Out of the Blue\\" and \\"Electric Youth.\\" It's only now that I'm able to appreciate Debbie's growth as a musician and producer.I'm glad to see other folks like this as much as her other work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as her first two but not bad","review":"This came out at the start of the 90's when the music was changing.

Some of the songs on this album are catchy and positive but never had the impact that \\"Out of the Blue\\" \\"Foolish Beat\\" \\"No More Rhyme\\" or \\"Lost In Your Eyes\\" had on me from her first two albums.I guess when I bought it I liked it a lot because I'd play it over and over, and her upbeat songs really encouraged me. Thanks to Debbie doing songs like \\"Stand Your Ground\\" and \\"Anything is Possible\\" and I can't remember the other song it says something about \\"energy up\\" (I didn't listen to that album as avidly as her first two), well those upbeat songs inspired me to buckle down and apply myself in school, and as a result I totally brought my grades up that year.

However, since I had just put in the organizer all the water had collected in that. I simply slid it out, and dumped at least a gallon of water.

Using real-life examples, such as playing baseball, dealing with cruelty, and being sick, Jill shows kids that they don't need to be afraid. They can rely on Jesus to help them through. My daughter, who is currently learning to ride her bike, especially likes the example of how Jesus helps you get back on and ride even after you fall.Renee Graef's illustrations are warm and friendly and add to the comforting message of the book.

That is, it completely amateur in feel and presentation. But it is amateur in the best sense of the word--it is written out of love for telling a story and expressing the joy the author feels has been a part of his life as a New York taxi driver. Amateur comes from the Latin amare, to love, as the author surely knows. Jerry Tierstein's love of a life not filled with fame and fortune, but with long hours of routine and demanding work, is uplifting in itself. His joy in his own good fortune in meeting Rudi Guiliani is balanced by a near-death experience he had picking up some hookers in the wee-small hours of the morning--as two men they had robbed came after them--and their taxi driver as well. Jerry sold me his book on a short cross-town trip from West 72nd Street to East 93rd. It won't take you much longer to get into the book--and the ride will be a delight."},{"rating":"2","title":"The author's wife made me buy it.","review":"I met the author's wife on MetroNorth and she was so hillarious I had to buy her husband's book.

I still don't understand how exactly the Drifter ship ended up at it's final (end book) destination given who is the real 'owner' of the ship.Anyway, I'd only read this if you liked the earlier volumes of the series, and even then, don't expect much.On a personal note, one of the things that really annoyed me about the novel was one of the main alien characters is named Wexial, which constantly reminded me of the magic cardWrexial, the Risen Deep - Worldwake Mythic Rareand generally made the story much harder to get into."},{"rating":"2","title":"The fun continues!","review":"If you have read the first two books, read this one too!

The effective range in total darkness, is NOT 100 ft, but more like 15ft. The image is NOT the quality they tout in fact it is fuzzy even under the best conditions. I am puzzled as to why the higher priced cameras offered by Swann are rated LOWER than this one. In their favor is the fact that the camera housing is metal, not plastic. It's unfortunate they didn't put in a better sensor. The one they used is no better than the X-10 garbage. Also, don't bother to complain to Swann because they will not answer any questions, and will refer you to the website instead which often doesn't have all the information. Before you buy, check out the manufacturers website...and then keep on shopping for something else that actually lives up to the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"try a differant brand","review":"My first camera was working for about 15 min when it crashed.

I called in again and was told i would have to pay for shipping again if i wanted to return it. Swann was been a complete waste of time and money, since then i've found other cameras online that i should have bought the first time.

The packaging clearly reads \\"the 11 infra-red LEDs project invisible light up to 2-3m/6-9ft\\". I don't know about anybody else, but I find there is a big difference between 9 feet and 100 feet! I haven't actually tried the camera outside, to see how far it will be able to record images in the dark, but I was expecting 100 feet when I bought it (paid extra for that). I'm probably going to have to buy a different camera now - one that will work at a greater distance in the dark."},{"rating":"2","title":"great item. must have for any cabinet makers saw.","review":"great product. got it much cheaper from somehwere else. for some reason amazon stocks the bc50 which has at least a third more steel in it for something like $200 less.

Locke, Maggie Smith and Judi Dench play aging sisters Janet and Urusla, living in Cornwall who discover a body washed up on their coastline. They nurse this barely alive young Polish man back to the land of the living and learn quite by accident that he is a talented violinist. In nursing him and learning to communicate with him, quite a few emotions are surfaced by the sisters, one who has lost a husband to war and one who has never had a chance to love.Billed as a sort of fairytale, complete with a wicked witch who swoops in and changes everyone lives, this wonderful coming of age (even if you are 60) story hits a tender spot and make you realize that a crush can happen at any age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Benchmark","review":"The history of Dench and Smith is quite evident in this superb film. It's not so common anymore to find a movie that radiates with the magnificent talent of established/seasoned actresses like Dench and Smith--this will sure be a classic benchmark in years to come.This ground-breaking plot sees Dench's character falling madly in love with young man--young enough to be her grandson--and shows emotions unseen in films with similar plot.The movie is not only substantial, but the talent of the lead cast is more than reason enough to see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange","review":"I wish I had not purchased this DVD.

You may know her as the matron in THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST, or you may know her as James Bond's female boss, M. I recently reviewed SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE and noted that her presence (as Queen Elizabeth, naturally) showed up the woeful lack of ability in a few costars. In this film, she's teamed with Maggie Smith, another fine British actress. Well, 15 minutes into this dog, I was bored out of my skull and stopped watching. Sorry, ladies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloooow, and never reaches its destination","review":"Awful movie. Sloooow pacing with a bunch of little twists that never panned out. This story about a May/December love mismatch has potential, but the writer/director put way too many barriers in the way - besides the age difference there's also a language barrier and a different-career barrier (he's a budding violinist, she stays home and gardens). Plus there's the creepiness factor in that the two old ladies practically kept him prisoner, refusing to let the authorities know they'd found him, apparently unconcerned that someone somewhere might be worried about him. And why make the pretty stranger seem so evil when all she wanted was to take the fellow under her wing and help him fly? Why add the pretense of danger (Oh no! They might be German spies!) if you aren't going to do anything with it? This story couldn't really decide where it wanted to go so it meandered around for a while and ended up going nowhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't enjoy","review":"While Judi Dench and Maggie Smith are fabulous actresses, I had a difficult time with this plot. In fact, there wasn't one. Mysterious young Polish man gets washed ashore. Two old maids take him in. He is healed. He plays the violin beautifully. Judi Dench falls in love with him. He goes away and becomes a concert violinist. End of story. Kind of a film festival-type film. There was no climax, no real problem solved. I don't enjoy the kind of plot where a poor old maid realizes for the first time in her life that she hasn't ever had romance, and probably never will (especially if she keeps falling for young men). Kinda depressing. They even threw in the f-word to try to attract certain audiences who evidently enjoy hearing those types of words. Kind of a dive for two celebrated actresses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing medium for two master actors","review":"I watched this movie because it had Judy Dench and Maggie Smith together. Very disappointing. The director gets a star for them and good cinematography, though the latter could have been accidental due to a beautiful setting. But two masters couldn't add enough dynamics to overcome a silly plot and poor script. The potential conflicts were weak, character development was poor, and the dynamics between Dench's character and the young man reminded me of Harold and Maude without the comedy, leaving it merely disgusting. And the ladies didn't wear lavender."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful. Moving. Gorgeous.","review":"I'd like to transplant myself in a little home next to the sisters' house, it would be bliss.

As all English films go this film moves as the pace of a slug in sea water; the acting in as woody as the woodpecker and I fell asleep 10 times mid way through this piece. The accents when they speak 'fluent' German are non existent and i basically listened to the audio while i surfed the net ( like now ).The best acting in this movie comes from the maid played by Miriam Margolyes as Olga the maid with a typically maid performance i.e fast talking, bossy, fat, and lumbering at great pace around her kitchen.No wonder they ended up being spinsters."},{"rating":"2","title":"A diamond among the stones...","review":"I just received and watched Ladies in Lavender and really never even heard of it before and ordered it on the strength of Judi Dench being in it. I was not disappointed in this beautiful film. I loved the acting, the scenery and the music was absolutely wonderful. People have complained about the plot being thin, the ending not explaining questions that supposedly were not answered to some critical viewers satisfaction. THAT did not bother me. I enjoyed a beautiful simple story that made me laugh, weep and cheer with joy as I watched it and at the end I reluctantly left it in my DVD player until I can find the time to have the peace and quiet to replay it again and again to my utter and complete hearts content.

As their due date approaches so does the twelfth of July. As the temperature rises, so does the tension and the laughter. Much of the rubbish in movies about Northern Ireland today is based on misery and fiction and ignorance. This movie truly portrays Belfast, the people, the humor and the tragedy. An excellent movie for those wishing to see what the atmosphere of Belfast is really like, and how the troubles affect everyday life. Having grown up in Northern Ireland before moving to the US 24 years later, I can speak from experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two years later still doing the job","review":"I have had this microwave for two years now.

The interpretations are individually crafted and unique. The tempos and phrasing are not conventional, nor are they extreme. They seem just right, as though Bohm had a unique insight into each composer's psyche. Though most were recorded during WWII in Nazi Germany, I sensed Bohm was in his own separate musical world.The Amazon listed description is inaccurate. The performances include Mozart's 35th symphony, not his 34th. Also, the Bruckner is #7, not #5 as listed. Nevertheless, I fully enjoyed all of these performances, and found them on balance preferable to his later modern stereo recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"On time.

In a way it doesn't sound like your typical INXS song, but I enjoy it nonetheless. Other favorites include Know the Difference, Lately, Hear that Sound, Bitter Tears and Disappear which I think is one of the best songs INXS has ever recorded.This is my favorite INXS CD, while it's pretty hard to top Kick which I also really enjoy, for some reason this one is always the one I reach for.

I also recently purchased a \\"iPod boom box\\" for the bargain price of $20 which has speakers with much better bass response - and it has an AM/FM radio to boot.

Second, The speakers can not re-produce all the notes of the music. May be that is expected for this price.I will give it another 1-2 day and if the static keeps coming, I will return this unit.

The ipod can't play music while in the dock - you have to take it out and plug in an additional (included) cable. So it works, but not while it's docked and charging.

The directions are very simple, and the device is easy to use. Adapters plug in without problem. The only flaw--which does get annoying--is that the volume control is push-button rather than dial, so when you wish to lower the volume, you must repeatedly press the lower volume button, which is not easy to do rapidly, as the button is hard to push with audible clicks each time. The volume control on the iPod itself doesn't work while in the cradle.

Aside from that, the base adapters don't fit the new models either, and even if you have an adapter that came with the iPod, it still won't fit, because the placement of the interface is about 1/16 of an inch off.

Mistakenly, I purchased it to help him learn to tell time as he was interested and ready to learn. This video is fine for helping children develop the concept of activity-related time throughout the day, but not what I was expecting or in the market for. Blue's Clues helps to develop so many skills that are often ignored in early educational efforts including excellent critical thinking and conceptual skills. However, it is important to purchase the video for the correct audience. This title was misleading to me, although the video would be valuable for a younger child who has yet to master the concept of time throughout the day.

The movements are fun and take practice, but the instruction is so simple. Less is more here. You get right into the veil and then go into a combination practice. Just the right amount of information is offered here because i doubt i could spin much more than this.

It was a super snug fit in the crib and now in her toddler bed it still is a perfect fit. I decided that for this baby I didn't want to spend as much for a mattress because it did seem silly. HOWEVER, this mattress didn't fit snug in my crib nor did it have the firm feel. This is a medium quality mattress for a medium price. I bought it yesterday and took it back today.

The cartridges are on the expensive side, but it was over a year with moderate printing until I had to replace it. A tip: when the print quality starts getting light, take out the cartridge, turn it back and forth a few times and re-insert.

First, at two points on the back where the small screws hold the stainless steel back to the case, the case material chipped off making it impossible to screw in two of the four the screws. Today, the wrist strap became unattached. Trying to reattach the strap, I saw that the case had broken at one of the small holes for holding the pins that attach watch bands to a watch. So now it is impossible to fasten the watch band to the watch.Maybe it was just a bad batch of plastic used for the case. I have had Casio watches that lasted for years.

As soon as I got it out of the packet I realised that the design of dildo seems to assume your g-spot is somewhere near your cervix. Maybe I have very strange anatomy, but my g-spot is no where near that deep. Worse, If I was to use it the way I intended to (sitting on it and grinding and rocking)the penetration was waaaay too deep for me to be pleasurable. If you like deep penetration and you have a fairly long vagina or you like your cervix being pummled, it might be ok. My hatred of this toy is mostly due to how excited I was by the concept. But the material feels nice, the vibrations and the shape of the vibe are good.bummer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"tease & denial toy","review":"If you're a girl that is into tease & denial, this the toy for you! You feel some stimulation, and it makes you try harder hoping to reach relief... but as hard as you try, you won't reach orgasm with no other stimulation. It's erotic torture, it's tantalism! So it could serve someone, somewhere... but not me.

Will Weaver has wrote the best baseball book."},{"rating":"2","title":"just as great as mansons","review":"i thought, since i was getting the autobiography, that there was no way i needed to have 2 manson books. but i saw a review that said, 'a great gap-filler!' and even though marilyns book was very satisfying, i decided i would take a chance. this book is really great, it has a lot of mansons very own quotes, and even though berkowitz is somewhat harsh, it is understandable he feels that way. it was very well written and includes trivial, yet wonderful little goods like the fact that brian warner favors calvin klein boxer briefs & the 9 satanic statements. a few nice photos and interviews. this is mostly about marilyn manson the band, not just mm the persona, or mm the person for that matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"A shorter road out of hell","review":"Though not the actual autobiography of Marilyn Manson this book gives you a good idea of what he went thtough as a child and the circumstances that created Marilyn Manson as we know him today.

It's a good read at a great price."},{"rating":"2","title":"A excelent book detailing Manson's life.","review":"This book is well writen. The author doesn't dawdle on one aspect of Mason excesivly. He manages to put forth all sides good and bad. He tells of the bands namesakes and gives you a breifing on them, while throwing in other stories and things to keep you interested. I recomend if you want know more about the Anti Christ."},{"rating":"2","title":"good overview","review":"This book gives a good overview about the origins, theory and practices of magical realism, and also posits this category among the principal literary and cultural practices of postmodernism. The only thing I did not like was the ending, in which the author over criticises the term more than suggesting further possibilities, practises and applications of magical realism, although the final chapter is named \\"The future of Magic(al) Realism\\".Another thing is that most of its content and reflexions can be found in Zamora's and Farris' books, but it is a good starting point for those who are not literary critics or specialists in this subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking For Langston? Look Elsewhere","review":"This pretentious film reveals little about Langston Hughes, one of the greatest writers of the 20th Century. Instead the filmmaker seems more interested in parading around a cadre of gay men on screen for no apparent reason. The film doesn't even explore with any depth the alleged sexual proclivities of Mr. Hughes. However, hat's off to the cinematographer and the production designer -- the film looks great. They should get plenty of work by placing the film on their respective demo reels. Unfortunately, as a fully realized work, the material is woefully lacking. At least the gay-themed \\"Tongues Untied\\" by the late Marlon Riggs, was at times insightful and funny. If after reading this review, you still decide to purchase this video, you will not only still be looking for Langston, but you will also be looking for your money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice leversets and easy to install","review":"Nice finish to match other decor and super easy to replace existing knobs.

Han Bennink and Dave Douglas have great fun here turning some standards inside out and developing their rapport through their own material. To some the thought of a drum/trumpet duet recording would seem unthinkable but they manage to sound like an orchestra, such is their use of space and their obvious enjoyment in each others company. Han Bennink's work with brushes is wonderful throughout, Too Close for Comfort will get you on your feet! My partner insists that, coincidentally or not, Dave's tune Serpentine is based on Stravinky's \\"Petrushka chord\\"... It is a shame that more did not come of Dave's involvement with Han and the Trio Clusone featuring Michael Moore and Ernst Reisjeger, that would have been quite something. Those of you in New York can catch Dave and Han with Misha Mengelberg and Brad Jones in the Autumn (Fall!)

The motor rebuild is a couple of general discussion paragraphs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbingly fascinating","review":"Lafferty had himself pigeonholed as a science fiction author, but the SF veneer here is fairly thin, with a little fantasy thrown in. If anything, the story has fewer \\"impossible\\" elements than most of his stories. This story of Irish immigrants in the rural Midwest (or if you insist, alien Puca immigrants to Earth) is strangely savage, marked by the author's typically surreal violence and verbal extravagance. Think of Tom Sawyer rewritten by Stephen King, and you may get some idea. Better yet, just read it.By the way, I do not think the last line of the chapter title poem \\"Or Altered World or Dead Dulanty\\" is a typo. I've seen that slightly awkward formulation of Either/Or somewhere before."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Little Ain't Enough","review":"OK, so I'm glad that some of Dennis' Sussex material is FINALLY available on CD. But all four of those albums were pure gold. Why, oh WHY didn't they just release a 2CD set with all four albums in thier entirety? They certainly would have all fit. I'm guessing that is the eventual plan, but they want to double dip by making us pay for this, and then later pay for the more complete package when it finally materializes. Why not make the two versions available at the same time and let us have the choice?? I'm gonna buy this (my albums are rice krispies as hell) just to have the music, and like I said, I'm glad it's finally out there again, but c'mon guys!! Let us have 'em all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THERE ARE THREE **REALLY ** GOOD REASONS NOT TO BUY THIS CD","review":"1.) This CD was compiled by a European outfit who did not get permission to distribute it. They do not pay Dennis Coffey any royalties, but legally pursuing the party who issued it is too expensive. I confirmed this with Mr. Coffey himself.2.) The audio on this CD is terrible. There is virtually no high-end frequency whatsoever, it sounds like a heavy blanket has been placed over the speakers. However, the worst part is:3.) The pitch of all the songs is incorrect; most or all the tracks are sped-up faster than the original tracks on vinyl.If you want to get the best-sounding CD of CF's solo work, PLUS get all the tracks in their correct pitch, buy\\"Absolutely the Best of Dennis Coffey\\"that was released in 2011. It has the majority of these tracks, and many others.Don't contribute to a rip-off!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Caused a short and Fire (!) in my Visor, and lousy service","review":"Thought the product would be a great way to save the environment, by using a rechargeable battery rather than continually running through batteries. One day, at work, I smelled an odor like matches and heard a popcorn crackling sound from my Visor. I immediately popped open the battery compartment and threw the batteries to the ground. The plastic around one of the terminal leads was melted and one battery was too hot to hold. On contacting ICU about a refund (since I didn't trust the unit anymore), they were neither helpful or apologetic in their emails. Simply, suggesting I contact a distributor about a refund.

I especially liked the protagonist, Rosalba (Licia Maglietta). She was very likable and you could believe that she was a housewife. Rosalba is left behind during a family vacation. Her husband is the typical middle-aged grouch whose impatience and tantrums further displaces Rosalba to another place in her heart. She takes a vacation to Venice and meets a new crowd. She begins a new life and over stays at the rundown apartment of Bruno Ganz, a depressed poet/waiter who wants to commit suicide. Over the course of days of working in the flower shop and singing with Ganz at the dance place, they fall in love despite the circumstances and age difference. I was happy for them. Rosalba's husband is a jerk who only wanted her to finish the housework. He had an ugly mistress who was close to the family. Rosalba's sons were self absorbed. I am happy Rosalba found an outlet for her to find happiness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfectly palatable","review":"Not a raucous comedy by any sort, but delightful in that it is just pleasing to watch. Its not artsy-fartsy, doesn't try to kill the script by going for laughs or gags, its just a nice light film to sit back and indulge in.What woman in her right mind HASN'T fantasized about chuckin' it and taking off in search of adventure?My bag is already packed for when that moment hits me...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where else but in Venezia???","review":"\\"La Serenissima\\"...where fantasy abounds and romance awaits at every turn, even in Venice's back streets and hidden \\"calli.\\" Licia Maglietta's expressive face really lights up this film, although all of the performances are strong. She has the charisma of a slightly-younger Norma Aleandro, and her comic timing is just about perfect. The film is peopled with wonderfully quirky characters and is very funny, especially if you're a student of the Italian language. I give it my highest rating (two wire whisks and a chicken leg.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a pleasant dream on a lazy summer day.","review":"A bored middle aged housewife whose family leaves her at a bus stop goes to Venice on a whim. She meets a charmingly eccentric cast of characters that lets her find relief from her daily life. She leaves routine behind and rediscovers life's pleasures and enjoyments. The film manages to show a serious mid-life crisis in a style that's heartwarming and comedic if not very realistic. I especially liked how it shows her anxieties about her family in dream sequences. That helps deal with the seriousness of worrying for her sons without taking away from the pleasant tone of the movie. Bread and Tulips has a marvelous cast and is beautifully filmed in Venice."},{"rating":"2","title":"LASAGNA IN THE FRIDGE, LOVE IN THE HEART","review":"When we first see Rosalba, the constrained fortysomething wife and mother on a dull vacation with her family in her native Italy, she is an unattractive awkward tourist with a black fanny pack revealing a drooping middle-aged spread, clumsily carrying bags of gawky souvenirs, while not having the time of her life on a bus trek through Italian historic relics. Somewhere along her independent journey, when she misses the bus while detained in a tourist stop restroom, actress Licia Maglietta transforms her character into an eye-popping, sexually exciting woman with an alluring expression of desire and maternal warmth, while doing little else than losing the fanny pack. Ah, that's amore! What a nice, non-abrasive film this is, offering not so much a feel-good response as it does a more satisfying glow of hearts yearning and emotional contentment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely story","review":"Ever feel stuck in your life and want to escape?or Ever feel like someone else is controlling your life?Well this is a movie for you!Become inspired to take your life by the horns in this lovely story about an Italian woman who escapes to Venice to start a new life."},{"rating":"2","title":"mother deserts family for 'love'","review":"where are all the pro-family types in these reviews? everyone seems to love this movie - about a house wife who is hare brained enough to miss the bus that is taking her and her family on a tour, and then frivolously embarks on a 'new life' in, of all places, venice. who wouldn't fall in love in venice? a dead person? yes, she meets a man (a father who has death fantasies, ie he would desert his own grand son) and falls in love with this guy - a waiter in a restaurant. licia manglietta is a delightful 40-something actress in the main role. uh, rest assured in the united states they would've recast the role with a 20-something ditz brain. this is a delightful movie - please check your morals at the door."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should have been entitled \\"Meet Warren Wiebe\\"","review":"This album has some great moments but the best tracks are buy the unforgettable Warren Wiebe, truly one of the unsung heroes of California pop music.

He worked with the likes of Celine Dion, Barbra Streisand, Gloria Estefan, Bill Champlin, Natalie Cole, Jay Graydon and Quincy Jones (who nicknamed him \\"Soul Rain Man\\") and many more.Warren had a lot of personal issues and tragically killed himself at the age of 45 on October 25,1998.Since then his voice has been heard on many compliation discs, but the saddest thing about losing Warren was he never released his own album.Hopefully Gabriel Raya who runs his site or some of the many producers who he worked with will put together an Eva Cassidy like tribute CD.

The album is incredibly eclectic, which further adds to its charm. When was the last time you heard me give such a resounding endorsement for a CD? See, you can't remember! You'd think I could get a kickback from Marc or his label or something for this kind of promotion. I've got a bunch of my friends to pick this CD up-- and no one has been disappointed.If that doesn't sell you, how's this-- I gave a copy to my cousin Jaime for her birthday and she loves it too.

He could make a great record with the right team!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Play it over and over and over and over!!!!!!!","review":"Are you tired of buying a CD and only getting maybe a few songs (if you're lucky) to play more than once? Then get Carencro because this is something that is a diamond in the rough! Something you can play without hitting the forward button time and time again. Put it on...let it play...you won't be disappointed. Give every song a chance and listen to the lyrics and the dynamics of the song in it's whole. I've had this CD for about 4 months or longer and it's the *only* one I play in my car. Even with the attention span of a gnat I never never never get tired of this CD.

Carencro is no one or two song album. It is one of those albums which is ripe with great songs throughout its vine including a hidden track (Track 23). Marc Broussard has a great vocal range and a talent for song craft.Although one might describe it as southern rock, soul, or jazz, Carencro demonstrates a nice stylistic range which really extends beyond such boundaries at times.I highly recommend this album and look forward to getting my hands on \\"Momentary Setback\\" and seeing where the future takes this talented young man from Lousianna.http://www.islandrecords.com/marcbroussard/site/musicvideo.las"},{"rating":"2","title":"The next BIG THING!","review":"I cannot reccomend this album enough.

I am sure Marc is a nice guy but I wish I could send this back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Consumer Alert!","review":"If you like \\"Home\\", the first cut on Carenco, then you can stop right there. Because the rest of the CD has nothing to do with that terrific song. This artist is still trying to find his voice and, at present, he seems to be channeling ghosts of the Doobie Bros., Stevie Wonder, Keb Mo and others. He absolutely can sing. Unfortunately, he has yet to develop his own style and sound (reminds me of \\"Ray\\" when he was cloning Nat King Cole). If he sticks to \\"Home\\", as was previously mentioned, then he's on to something. But if he goes for the fluff and commercial stuff, like the rest of the cuts, he will just be another good voice who sold out."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE good song!","review":"I can't possibly see how ANYONE could say that this cd is worth buying.

It's like a member from a boy band got loose...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good voice; rubbish lyrics","review":"I stupidly bought this on the basis of the thirty-second soundbite of the first track, which is absolutely the only decent song on the cd. His voice is strong and confident but his lyrics... Oy! \\"When I get there you better be ready to rocksteady\\" and \\"You were sent here from the stars, that's the beauty of who you are\\". To be honest, I can't be sure about the accuracy of the quotes as I skipped through the album, making disparaging noises. It actually took four people to come up with this poetry, if you can believe it.Come back to us in about five years, Marc, unless you are specifically aiming your music at pre-teen girlies. Great voice, though. For anyone who is interested, Marc Hest is more challenging and I'm totally digging that \\"Keane\\" cd. I think it's called \\"Hope and Fears\\". Think a non-suicidal Rufus Wainwright, pianos and all. The more morose amongst you can try Damien Rice, before all the hype carries him away. Good stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Yet Still Darn Awful","review":"I was just irritated after finding out that the rest of the album were bland love songs that were nothing like \\"Home,\\" of which I heard a live version on a late night talk show and persuaded me to buy the cd. \\"Home\\" is a hauntingly beautiful blues song that chills to the bone. The rest of the album is as immature and cheesy as modern \\"R&B.\\" Then I heard a reference to Dylan and I flipped. One song begins, \\"Dance for me girl as I strum my guitar...\\" Seriously? Please don't mention Dylan in a song if you can't even come up with a decent line. If I was able to download a song or two of the rest of the album for free, I wouldn't have given this horrible excuse of an artist and his label any money. A great voice but get someone else to write for you or think about something other than a woman's skin and eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete trash","review":"They've been playing this mediocre music at Borders for the past few days and it's driving me crazy. There's no musical craftsmanship at all, no attempt to write a good musical hook or tight lyrics - just a whole album of bland filler. It's possible I missed the one good song on this album and keep hearing that \\"Save me, give me what I need\\" garbage, but the level of skill, sensitivity, and musicianship needed to produce that mind-numbing refrain doesn't inspire confidence.It's sad to think this music is popular at all. Adam Sandler seems to be doing us a public service by keeping those catchy 80's tunes in our public memory. I mean, laugh at Duran Duran, but any of their teen-directed pop was way better crafted than this monotone tripe.Borders, PLEASE STOP PLAYING THIS ALBUM!

You have caught the attention of a lot of us with Home. Now c'mon Marc DON'T BLOW IT! The review by Tammy La Gorce is dead on and I hope you listen and listen good. Take us Home Marc. That song is why we are listening to you now. An album full of that kind of music will catapult you in to stardum and respect. I pay good money for my music and when I smell talent I want more of it.

Once you pop it in and listen to the first track, \\"Home\\", you will know what I mean. He doesn't sound like a 20 some year old pop star. He sounds like an AMAZING singer/songwriter. Although a few are nearly strictly pop songs such as \\"Rocksteady\\", \\"Save Me\\" and \\"Where You Are\\", there is so much more that this CD has to offer. A soothing slow shuffle, \\"Lonely Night in Georgia\\". A straight up funky tune reminiscent of Stevie Wonder, \\"Come Around\\". I also love \\"The Wanderer\\" and \\"Hope For Me Yet\\", which really show off the songwriting side along with his great vocal ability. The hidden track is just him and his acoustic. It is also very well done.I just love this cd. So diverse. There is a song for almost any mood. It is quite catchy and simply fun and pleasing to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"FAN FOR LIFE","review":"I heard \\"Come Around\\" and \\"Home\\" as in air flight entertainment and bought \\"Carencro\\" the next day. The plane touched down too later, or else I've purchased it the same day. Eight months later, my love affair with this soulful, funky, talented singer/songwriter/guitarist's music is stronger than ever. His ability to move through musical genres adding his own flavor is amazing. Marc Broussard's voice has a smoky, aged texture that wraps around the listener, caressing, cajoling and ultimately drawing you to him. I've played \\"Carencro\\" for anyone who'd listen. Buy it, make sure you listen to the bonus track,(...). He will rock your socks off and have you begging for more. With his live shows and CDs, he has stolen my heart musically and earned a fan for life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always tradeoffs, but this is the right rack for me!","review":"I did a lot of research and ended up with the Thule T2. I have a big family, so we bought the 2\\" model and the +2 extension--4 bikes! We have NOT been disappointed. I did a detailed write-up; google \\"squidoo bestbikerack\\".One point I'll note here is that the Saris Cycle-On Pro has a better system for mounting the rack to the hitch--the Thule T2 requires a wrench to bolt on the hitch pin--a little clumsy. But the CycleOn Pro doesn't tilt down to allow access to the rear cargo area, which was a must-have for us. I discovered that no rack is the 100% perfect solution, but the T2 comes awfully close for my family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the Yakima","review":"I bought this over the Yakima equivalent for the locking accessory. What a mistake i made. The racketing system that locks the arm down over the bike is made of plastic and doesnt work.

But i would steer clear if i was you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this CD!","review":"This is unquestionably the best material Paul Kantner ever wrote for Grace Slick to sing. With the usual cast of San Franciscan talent to draw upon, this offering is musically excellent. If you like Blows Against the Empire or Chrome Nun, you will cherish this find.Be prepared. While most of the work is warm, feel-good, love-your newborn type stuff, there are more than some rough edges lurking. The album was released at a time LSD still reigned and apparently the band wanted to make certain you could conjure up some wierdness. If you can handle the initial cut, subtitled the Cannibal Song, you'll be fine.But if you missed this 25 years ago and you really liked this kind of rock of roll, you are missing a real treat if you pass this up.

This book by Don Greene was developed specifically for the professional classical musician. The methods might be useful to people involved in the other performing arts, but that is not what it is specifically for.As for the quality, I haven't yet finished the book but find it interesting and potentially useful. The connection between professional sports and professional musicians is interesting to explore. If you are debating between this book, and The Inner Game of Music by Barry Green, I would reccommend this book if you are a performance or serious student of classical music. There are fewer errors in this book, and it is more directly applicable. However, if you are more of an amateur, then I think that The Inner Game of Music would be more interesting to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummm...","review":"I'm sure there is more advice in this book than what I've gathered so far, however, the style of writing for this book made it completely unappealing. It is written in the form of transcripts taken from conversations the author had with two different clients. At first I thought that may help me relate to the information better, but instead it just made it harder to find the information that would be helpful to me. The book also doesn't explain in anyway how to apply these audition success techniques to your life, so overall I didn't like the format of the book and it was very unhelpful to me. The author has another book titled \\"Fight Your Fear and Win\\" that is ten times better in that sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crossed signals","review":"Support your hardworking local semioticians -- and don't buy this book.

It describes how the author raised awareness in his community and made a difference despite overwhelming odds. I found it inspiring and uplifting despite the grim topic of toxic pollution.

Hence, the version of ENEMIES that I read was a translation.Still, the simplicity of his prose shines through the novel.

Pozner's statement that Russia's conversion to Eastern Orthodox Christianity was a tragic mistake that had thwarted the development of the Russian polity says it all - ignorance and rabid russophobia.

He has a keen imagination which can imagine worlds and universes which follow vastly different rules than ours. Fans of Flatland will appreciate some of his humor.I enjoyed reading his first effort, and wish he found time and/or a publisher for more science fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally worth it","review":"This product was totally worth it. I've tried nearly everything to prevent seed messes on the floor but nothing has really worked. This product was great because it was thick enough so my birds didn't destroy it (like they did every other barrier) but thin enough to manipulate to fit the cage. The only thing I would suggest is buying multiple, one isn't enough. I bought three and put it all the way up near the top of the cage and I used packaging tape to seal the pieces together. But it does work and the price was way cheaper than I was expecting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not attaching well / not practical to clean.","review":"I bought two of these seed guards hoping to use for two of my cages. They first look fine but the glue's for attaching them don't work so I had to replace them with regular tapes and the attract dirt...

I am now going to give the acrylic sturdy ones a try were no taping is needed and they can be attached with fixtures."},{"rating":"1","title":"product is a failure","review":"The velcro tabs provided do not have adequate adhesive so they fall right off. The only way to keep the guard on is to use tape, which looks sloppy and doesn't allow for removal to clean.If that wasn't bad enough as soon as I got this on the cage my cockatiel started biting right through it. The product is cheap but with shipping it comes out to about $10. Don't waste your money! Good idea but poorly done.They need better adhesive and thicker material for the guard."},{"rating":"1","title":"bird guard","review":"this was so cheap I had to try it but it doesn't work.

As a longtime Eno and Cluster fan, I always wished I could like an album named Cluster & Eno more than an album that didn't even have the name Cluster on it, but such was not to be. I only like one track on Cluster & Eno (the second one: \\"Schone Hande\\"), whereas I like the entirety of After the Heat.If nothing else, After the Heat contains the last of Eno's worthwhile vocal songs. Nothing he's done since has come close. Another gem to seek out after obtaining this album for \\"Broken Head\\" and \\"The Belldog\\" is the Phil Manzanera solo album Diamond Head for it's two Eno-penned and Eno-sung songs \\"Big Day\\" and \\"Miss Shapiro\\" (covered on the 801 Live album)."},{"rating":"2","title":"I lived the same story","review":"This is great book for anyone who understands that being a new mom is not all it is cracked up to be.

You need to have a large attention span. If you do not at least there are little things they added that can keep your attention. The movie starts out interesting and starts to get boring. It gets more interesting in the end. Its a very artsy movie so you need to have a sophisticated taste. If you have severe motion sickness I sugest you do not watch this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first truly original animated film since _Fantasia_","review":"_Waking Life_ is not just the best animated film of last year; it's also the most original animated film to come along since Disney's _Fantasia_. Director Richard Linklater's plotless meditation on existence occasionally grows a bit monotonous, but the ingenious, state-of-the-art visual style never fails to astonish. The film doesn't reward multiple viewings so much as demand them.The DVD features a flawless video and audio transfer of the film. Extras include a director's commentary, a second commentary by twenty-five computer animators who worked on individual scenes, a gallery of deleted and rejected animation, and excerpts from Linklater's raw video footage (which was used as a template for the animation). The overall package offers an in-depth look at the creation of this technical marvel.For Linklater fans, animation buffs and philosophy junkies, this DVD is a must-own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting animation technique but nothing else","review":"The 'story' is non-existent, only following one guy around as he goes from place to place wandering aimlessly. I do not exaggerate. What follows is nothing more than over-intellectualized psycho-babble about the meaning of life. Heavy on the babble. Heavy on the psycho. Only 2-3 snippets, as far as I remember, featured \\"the common man\\"'s plight... The conversations didn't even spark my interest in the subject matter because it all sounded so pretensious. A perfectly intolerable film. Avoid this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you want to think","review":"Linklater's movies are unique. This one submerses you into visual and intellectual stimulus unlike the others. The visual effects alone will blow you away. The overlaying score feeds the other half. If you like to follow the \\"why?\\" that your head seems to ask sometime, this film will definitely scratch the itch."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Either \\"Get it\\" or You Don't","review":"And before people jump all over me, I'm not saying that people who don't like it are not intelligent. I'm saying that they don't think in the way this film thinks. I, for one, do enjoy these types of discussions of the mind, and found it a fascinating look at the subconscious. Some of the segments are better than others (my favorite was the biker scene), but they all work into each other and (again, if you are pre-disposed to liking these types of discussions) are very thought-provoking. This is not something to put on in the background, and it's not really something a group of friends would get together and watch (unless you have a group of deep-thinking, open-minded friends who are not easily \\"bored\\"). This movie is best enjoyed watching by yourself and really giving thought to the many ideas presented therein. I am not a person who is easily swayed by the things I watch or see, but this movie really did change how I felt about a few subjects of the mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Incredible","review":"An insightful look into the abstract human mind. The movie basically consists of the main character moving throughout a dream, discussing theories of all of life's complexities and mysteries with random people. This is not a movie for the narrow-minded, thinking outside the box is a prerequisite for enjoying this movie.In addition to heavy abstract intellectual themes, the visual technique, called rotoscoping, creates a dreamlike, \\"other worldly\\" feel to the movie.The only reason it doesn't get five stars is that it is slightly difficult to follow in the beginning, though it does get progressively easier. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much dialogue!","review":"While \\"Waking Life\\" is truly visually innovative, its animation is truly lost on the surplus of dialogue that fills the movie. The dream-like segues between conversations are certainly the high points of the film, if the hapless movie-goer can stay awake through the proselytizing, pretentious, overly trendy and post-modern pseudo-philosophy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my gosh, what utter garbage!","review":"I'm sorry, I don't see the art in rotoscoping (drawing over filmed images), so calling this thing \\"animated\\" is giving it way too much credit. OK, there's nothing worth looking at, is there any salvation in the dialog? Only if you consider the typical Usenet exchange, or Internet chatroom conversation, to be the height of wit and wisdom. This film is a complete waste: no-talent slackers trying to masquerade as art.

With many themes and topics explored throughout the movie, this movie explores the question of are we existing in our waking life or our dreaming life? It is a truly moving, life changing movie! Not meant for everyone, but to those who love these philosophical questions, I would recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Touches on many of Philosophical questions, artistically","review":"As a philosopher I have heard most of these concepts. Reality is not as fixed as we would like to think of in our own little box, but we do have to play in this game. The movie goes through the questions, but like most philosophical questions.. their was no resolution in the movie... life it unreal. This pointed out that the belief makes it so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting movie","review":"This movie is not for those with short attention spans. In fact, it's simply not for everyone. However, the intellectuals, dreamers, and other artsy folks are likely to find something worthwhile in this one. Some people I have spoken with have even said that this movie has changed their lives.This film is basically an animated journey through thoughts, events, and other things that all somehow relate to the main character. The content of some of the discussions in certain scenes may bore some people, but will likely interest the target audience that I listed above.The animation is pretty interesting as well. It's mostly pleasant to look at although the style jumps around throughout the movie. The soundtrack works well with the visuals and, though perhaps a secondary aspect of the film, is still very well done.Overall \\"Waking Life\\" is a sporatic and somewhat aimless film, but very much worth seeing for its intellectual content and innovative visuals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waking Life","review":"The first thing I must mention as well as appalud about \\"Waking Life\\" is the animation job done here. Its as if the flimakers here shot everyting on a normal camera and then went back into the sudio and then painted over it. Weather or not they acually did that or not I am not sure. The effect is truly trippy, and very uniqe. I have never seen anything quite like it berfore.Next thing I must mention and appalud is the screenplay. Its a screenplay that asks the complex quastions of life. Like what are we here for? Is there life after death? What are dreams?Warning. If you like to watch movies or you like to watch animated flicks, because you like to zone off, rather than think hard about what your watching. I suggest you avoid this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suitable for late night phone calls in junior high","review":"First of all, the philosophy of this film is juvenile. (...) You know, it is possible to \\"get\\" something and still not like it.On a serious note; do not watch this if you are epileptic. Since the frames are rotoscoped entirely by hand, they do not line up precisely from one frame to the next. This results in a strobing effect that left me with a splitting headache within 2 minutes, and left me nauseous within 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waking life","review":"The dvd you sent was not compatible to European dvd-recorders and therefore worthless to me, although it may be a good film. I did not return it because that would be too much hassle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably the stupidest movie I have ever seen!","review":"I HATE this movie with every fiber of my being. I watched it with some friends that LOVE it and I almost had to disown them. I think the filter they used on this movie and Scanner Darkly is a STUPID GIMMIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you cant make an interesting movie don't try to cover it up with a stupid photoshop filter. For those of you who think it is \\"animation\\", your WRONG! It was filmed with real people then it had a filter applied to it (I work in the industry, trust me). Which makes it NOT animation. If I could give this movie negative stars I would. 1 star is VERY generous.This movie reminds me of when I was in high school and everyone was trying weed for the first time and every thing was just \\"totally blowing their mind, man\\"You want some REAL philosophy? read PlatoIf you think this movie is DEEP, your stupid.

Its all boring theory.Imagine cornering your local philosophy professor, asking him to talk endlessly about what he's teaching this semester, and there you have this film.If you're interested in philosophy, I recommend you enroll yourself in college and take the courses.

Not because it's gross, but because the constantly shifting, floating, warping images were producing the same sensation I used to get on car trips when I was a kid. I've learned from experience (boat rides, airplane flights, etc.) that I am much more susceptible to motion sickness than most people, and Waking Life made me very queasy, very fast. (And from the 10-15 minutes I did see, the dialog is no prize either; kind of like what you'd hear at a university-area coffee house at 2 am.)I realize that many other people think this is a really wonderful movie, but if you have motion-sickness tendencies, stay away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice animation, bad movie","review":"\\"Waking Life\\" is absolutely gorgeous. I loved the animation dripping and flowing as a dreamlike constant. The movie, on the other hand, lacked direction. I found that the connections the dialogues made, while staying on topic, seemed to just dump information and not guide the story in any direction. The dialogues made me think, which other reviewers have claimed is the best part of the movie, but the film didn't allow any time for the ideas to come to life. Instead, I was left frustrated by a lack of flow. There was no resolution or rising or falling action in \\"Waking Life\\": just content. I did not like that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waking Life","review":"This movie offers a nice philospohical view on some trends in human evolution and thought. A nice cross section of various philosophies is investigated and discussed through animated characters. The movie is heady and raises a lot of questions. If you are of the intellectual bent and like to watch films more than once, this one is for you. It could also serve as an atypical date movie - one that leads into conversation.Check out also- I heart huckabees and what the bleep do we know."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good movie, but understand what's coming...","review":"The movie was interesting in relating life and existence, common understanding and accepted ideas, and that was the primary focus of it. I enjoyed the notions that were shared in it, but it was generally without much of a plot, more a string of thoughts. I would enjoy to watch it for the mind-expansion, but it can wear you down in a dark movie theater. I had to go after about an hour of watching it. I can sleep at home. But I will be watching it again, possibly with a purchase in the equation."},{"rating":"1","title":"sophomoric pseudo-philosophical torture","review":"Along with some of the other dissatisfied reviewers, I've enjoyed the style and originality of Linkletter's previous films. Visually, the film is stunning and perhaps even a landmark of sorts. Content wise, it doesn't even merit a B-minus from a college level film making class. This is a tortuous and meandering death march of stoner philosophy and pretentious intellectual hogwash. Even the phenomenal visuals can't remotely resurrect this irritating montage of tired cliches."},{"rating":"1","title":"so disappointed","review":"I heard such fantastic things, but I couldn't even finish it. I felt like I was sitting and listening to one of those guys you knew in college who talked and talked about postmodernism and existentialism, but never actually SAID anything.Further, reviewers keep writing \\"Not for everyone\\" or \\"Not everyone will understand.\\" I get it, just like I can \\"understand\\" the movie Gigli, but that doesn't mean it's smart or sophisticated, or worth watching or that it even has a point!Do not waste two precious hours of your life on this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Endless Torture","review":"One can imagine this film playing well on college campuses, where philoso-babbling is good sport. One can imagine it playing well in art houses, where self-flagellation passes for virtue. For the rest of us, there is only the Chinese water torture of wretched excess and navel-gazing. The good news is, were you to turn off the sound, you could be hypnotized by the absolutely spellbinding animation, thoroughly original and brilliantly executed. The bad news is, if you turn the sound on, you may find yourself asking questions like, \\"Am I writing a review, or am I dreaming about writing a review? Am I a dream a man is having about writing a review? Am I a review of a man dreaming? Am I a man dreaming about writing a review so that he can discover what he thinks?

It helps if you are knowledgeable regarding the references but not necessary and, in fact it might even may better if they serve as an intro.

Alas, as I have been clean and sober for 30 years I didn't succumb but it really was a temptation and that is saying a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was a good effort","review":"This movie takes the risk and gets silly at times. It is a series of monologues (Or an alternative description would be 'ramblings'). There is not, however, anything deep or eye-opening about it. Rather just observations from an 'altered' state of mind. As a whole, it comes off as pretentious. The rotoscoping technique used is different but not terribly inventive or original. I wasn't impressed but it was a good effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want to like it, but can't","review":"I'll admit that there are many amazing qualities of this movie; the animation over live action technique produces brilliant effects that are visually interesting the entire way through. The wealth of ideas presented about dreams, life and the world around us are incredibly vast and thought provoking. The acting (predominantly the voices) is incredibly well done, as is the music. But unfortunately, there is no plot. Not only that, but the ideas keep coming at you. While some of the ideas were interesting, others were not. And the ones that were interesting became lost in the shuffle. I went to see the movie with three friends; whithin half an hour they were all asleep. This movie is a few good ideas and scenes stretched out far too long. That it keeps throwing out more and more ideas at the audience doesn't serve to make it good...and i'm usually very open minded."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most fantastic journey ever.","review":"The movie is without a doubt the most amazing piece of cinema made in period. The insane animation is only matched by the depth of the point the movie trying to portray. Its a story about whats real whats in the mind and everything in between. Not to mention this movies imagery and story matter will make you feel like your on drugs. But don't let that deter you, this movie really is the stuff that dreams are made of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Am I awake...or what...?","review":"As profound and verbose as it is, \\"Waking Life\\" never fails to intrigue me. Linklater enhances his reputation as a maverick and visionary. A lot of the stuff sounded silly, but it ALL made me think. Isn't this what original film is all about? It's episodic (Thank God!), and as such doesn't let any idea get more profound than it is. I was entertained and moved."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing.","review":"A great movie for people who think The Matrix is too simple or are just mesmerized by great animation. Occasionally some of the dialogue went in one ear and out the other, but during those times the animation was particurally insane and I still had my eyes glued to the screen.Not only is the film smart and gorgeous, but it has some really clever creative moments right out of everyone's dreams.I saw Waking Life in September and I still think about things that were brought up. This film is simply amazing in every aspect that a film can be amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for everyone","review":"This is not the kind of movie that you play when you want adventure, fun, deep interest, easy watching, etc. In other words, it is not a movie for the impatient or for those with a short attention span.The visuals on this are spectacular, but I also enjoyed the voices. I like the low-key effect it all had; most of the movie is relaxed and low-key.The plot is simple, and unfolds slowly. If you've read this far, all the other reviewers have no doubt given away the plot, which is a shame. Part of the fun of watching this movie is trying to guess what is really happening to the protagonist.The animation reflects the dreamy pace beautifully. If you get bored with (or lost by) the monologues, you can just lean back and watch the way the pictures unfold in front of you. Artists especially should take note of this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Dinner With Anime","review":"Trippy and incisive or visually irritating and pretentious? Half-empty or half-full? Richard Linklater's unique rotoscoped treatise on the Meaning Of Life seems to polarize its reviewers like night and day. If you like neat little tied-up Hollywood endings prefaced by neon signs flashing plot points along the way, you are likely to find this one a snoozefest. If you go into this one with an open mind and an objective philosophical stance, you'll find it at least mildly engaging, and never boring. The fact that the film suffers from Attention Deficit Disorder is what makes it most interesting to this reviewer. Try this at home: Pop this film in the player while you're watching your favorite commercial TV program. During the spot breaks, instead of hitting 'mute' or surfing channels, watch \\"Waking Life\\" in 3 to 5 minute serialized segments. It all suddenly makes much more sense, doesn't it? It all boils down to perception (and I believe that's the point of the film)."},{"rating":"2","title":"don't take it so seriously","review":"Well, I didn't bother wading through all 126 reviews, but I read a good many of them, and it seems to me that people fall into one of two camps: either they hate \\"Waking Life\\" because it's pretentious, or they love it because it's thought provoking. I think there's something to be said for each of these views. There is a whole lot of philosophizing going on here - some of it is profound, and some of it is BS - just like life. And, also like life, it's up to YOU to decide which is which! I wouldn't assume that any of what comes out of the characters' mouths are Linklater's pet ideas - characters are characters, and the filmaker may or may not agree with what they are saying. As for the animation, I thought it was pretty cool. It's a real mixed bag though - you might like some segments and not like others. But I'm kind of surprised that anyone would find it boring - I would never say that. \\"Waking Life\\" is a fun movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short review","review":"This is the stupidest movie ever.

I can't imagine anyone finding it interesting, but apparently, many do. Maybe Philosophy itself just bores me.

It is definitely not for all tastes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindless Prattle","review":"Don't be fooled by the innovative animation techniques. This movie is filled with unrealistic situations and improbable dialogue. I knwe that when I am with my friends in a sports bar or club, we ignore our surroundings and chat about the complexities of life while sipping our beers and chomping on chicken wings. I get the concept of what the director was attempting to do, but the idea of random people who just happen to all be educated about quantum physics, exhistentialism, and sociology is just plain nonsense (esp. Ethan Hawke. Come on first you see him in Training Day then in a deeply philosophical musing? Come on.)

WAKING LIFE was nothing more then a movie were someone had a great idea for ainteresting concept and that was all. The film would have worked as a 15 minute short film (tops).It was almost comically pretentious and the script writer seemed to being trying to be ultra-philosophical on a subject that is not deep enough to talk about as long as they did. The questionthe film asks is one asked over and over- one that simply makes you go \\"hmm?\\" and nothingmore. It was almost like watching people pretend to be intellectual who were not. This film wasinsulting to intelligent audience members and was one of the very worse movies I have ever seen.The creators cannot fool everyone that they had anything original or interesting to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad - an entertaining little animated flick on philosphy, metaphysics,","review":"Not bad - an entertaining little animated flick on philosphy, metaphysics, objective human perception. if you liked 'what the bleep do we know?\\" you'll probably like this movie. it's only about 85 min long, but the animated main characters encounters various people throughout his day and hears their perspectives on life (philosophers, an evolutionary biologist, young intellectuals etc.). the voices are from real interviews it sounds like and they're just placed in the movie to fit the flow...a unique movie that's worth watching. 4.2 stars. written review from a 34 yr old atheist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fraudulent Item","review":"The image posted is the Tasco Offshore 21 Marine Binocular.

The writing is absolutely wonderful. I have read many books in my life but I have rarely read one so beautifully written and well composed. There were paragraphs and passages that I read over two and three times simply because they were so tasty. The story is broken up into chapters which comprise little subplots of their own. This makes for easy reading because you can read a chapter or two at a time and still enjoy the entire book. Read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Green Shadows, White Whale","review":"So many people think of Ray Bradbury as a Science Fiction writer, but he really is a writer of great dimension. In Green Shadows, White Whale, he shows us a great view of Ireland as seen through his acquired pub friends, as they tell him stories, and through the people he meets. Written almost as a collection of short stories, his use of words is poetic! We also get a glimpse of the strong character of John Huston. Bradbury plays the upper crust, fox hunting, privileged Ireland against the common man with humor and imagination. I thoroughly enjoyed his book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough for a book","review":"It happens that Ray Bradbury spent a few months in Ireland while he was writing the script for a Moby Dick movie and he decided to write a book about his experience in the land of St. Patrick. The problem is that nothing worth of a whole book happened there. Just an eternal rain, some anecdotes with locals and many critics to the Irish."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of both worlds, fact and fiction","review":"Ray Bradbury wrote the screenplay for John Huston's Moby Dick. It is a hysterical account of his exploits in Ireland where he wrote the piece. It is also a work of fiction because he combined some of his previous short story writings about Ireland into the book. Bradubury masterly weaves both fact and fiction into a enjoyable tour-de-force. If you are an avid Bradbury fan, you will remember some of his earlier work and recognize the stories. If not, then I envy you because you will not be able to distinguish fact from fiction. Bradbury does both a wonderfull job of catching Irelands essence and terrible poverty of which he covers lightly. He also hints at the terrible genious of John Huston without going into the gory details. This book is a very fast read and is wonderfull. It is certainly deserving of the national book award it recieved."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst of the FF replicas","review":"Their are several Final Fantasy replica swords on sale here on Amazon.com..

The problem with this book is that its treatment of iconographic history is bad and its theology isn't really much better. Its main redeeming quality is its illustrations, which are really not all that numerous. I would skip this in favor of two others; the first is The History of Icon Painting, written by a panel of distinguished iconography historians, each an expert in one particular period and school of iconography, and edited by Archimandrite Zaccheus; the second is The Meaning of Icons by Leonid Ousspensky (who was himself an outstanding iconographer) and Vladimir Lossky (who was a respected Russian academic theologian). Both are available here on Amazon. Another good source is also by Ousspensky, his Theology of the Icon (2 volumes)."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Unknown Album With Several Gems","review":"Back in the early 90s a friend of mine introduced me to this unique band from South Africa. The only way I can describe their music is African rock. I actually feel like I am in Africa when I listen to some of these songs due to the vivid lyrics and the use of African percussion, tribal-like chants, and jungle cries. The band at this time was comprised of the very talented Robbi Rob on vocals & guitar, Robby Whitelaw on bass, and PK on drums. My favorite songs are Remember (good verse & chorus), Sally (\\"if you can't come, well baby that's your fault\\"), Just For A While (great airy acoustic song), Come To See You Fall (catchy uplifting chorus), The Mode (excellent song with a great chorus and ripping guitar solo!), and White Boys In The Jungle (great percussion). As I write this review the cover for their second album Love Under Will is mistakenly being shown. You probably will not be able to find this album new so buy it used if you don't already have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"this is a show we saw on the london stage a long time ago.

The biggest problem and it is big is that he only hints at the apostasy within the hierarchy of the Church. Nothing for example is mentioned about one of the biggest apparitions of our Lady at LaSalette in France. This apparition is ignored by many and has been because it deals with the very difficult subject of apostasy of the Church and Rome becoming the seat of the AC. This is hard stuff to hear back when the apparition occurred and now but at the dawn of Petrus Romanus, readers deserve to know this information. Just my .02"},{"rating":"2","title":"Scholarly, but still extremely readable. Excellent!","review":"Don't be daunted by its 500-page length. TTT is extremely wellresearched and scholarly, but also eminently readable. The first twochapters, on Tradition and the effect of extreme higher critics,should be manditory reading for all Catholics, even those not interested in eschatology. The remainder of the book is an excellent antidote to end-times hysteria; it restricts itself to approved prophecies only, and beautifully explains what Catholic teaching really is on the subject. My only complaint is that there are quite a few editing glitches; that's easily overlooked, however, in light of the overall high quality of this work."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent reference for the all important proposal!","review":"As someone who works privately with dissertation students, I give this book my highest recommendation. The essence of any dissertation is the proposal. It serves the blueprint for the entire dissertation process and can determine the ultimate success of the dissertation. When students contact me in regard to their dissertation proposal, I recommend that they buy this book and use it as a reference. The information contained in this book is invaluable, and it is one of the most practical guidebooks I have come across in recent years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Helpful","review":"This book has definetely helped me in the area of drawing male characters. I have also been able to draw females with ease, but the males I always found frustrating. The step-by-step intructions really let you in on the main parts of the male and how to draw them correctly. It compares it to the female body as well.Various poses are included in it as well which helped me a lot in my characters. If you struggle with the same problem as I did, then I highly recommend this guide. It also includes a fantastic section on hands, feet, and charaters wearing glasses. Any true artist should own this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful for more than just manga art","review":"This is a great reference book in my opinion, especially if you have no idea how to even pronounce anatomy. If you're looking to be able to draw seriously thoroughly detailed super-muscle men, this might not be the best book, but It definately is great for beginners, and it gives a lot of great examples of how what part of the body looks liek what when a male character does what. For instance theres a whole page on hands, and hand positions, and one for glasses... one shows how the chest moves as the arm moves. Great reference if you don't have a model or a bunch of nude pictures in front of you. I love this guide. Borrowed it to my friend who want's to improve her skills as well, and she's becoming amazing at drawing men!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How to Draw Manga","review":"The entire experience was amazing.

In fact, Before I got this book, the faces and heads were good, but the bodies looked like cilenders with arms attatched. This book covers every aspect of drawing the male form from the basics of figure drawing, to little details like adding age to a characters features. There is so much to learn about art, but this book simplifies things to the extent where an artist with enough familiarity with the style can refine her or his art many times over."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent suplement!","review":"This book, like most in Hayashi's \\"How to Draw Manga\\" series, is a fabulous suplement to his introductory books. It's not meant to show every detail of drawing, as that's what the basic books are for. However, it does help clearly define the differences between the male and female figures, and goes into detail about male body structures, common design styles and builds.Excellent reference material, a must have for the anime/manga artist! I know I've inproved since getting it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Agreed","review":"I agree with the first reviewer. You have to have a basic knowledge of drawing to use this book, but once you do, it will be very helpful.

He was under utilized by Hollywood as a dramatic actor, but as a comic actor he wasn't that bad. The camera had a love affair with his open good looks, a pleasant sense of humor and the ability to laugh at himself. No deep introspective thinking needed with this film. The plot is simple enough, he is retired military and he and his son have restored a Sherman tank. The local sheriff a slightly sadistic 'Boss Hawg' has issues and throws the son in a prision camp. And its Dad to the rescue. A good afternoon romp with a silly plot. You could do worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tank","review":"This is a very good movie.

I just bought it and watched it for the first time since then. It's a typical 80s movie with cheesy lines and some very unrealistic scenes. I'd have to call it a cross between Red Dawn and Over The Top. Some funny parts, stuff gets blown up, run over, and a family grows closer together. The language isn't appropriate for young kids.

Both books would be awesome for any new mom, any seasoned mom or any........one in between as we all count and have tried and true answers, at least they worked on our own children.

Ms. Bisset asked for advice from every day people and, I imagine, just any parent in general for their insight, which I thought was great, but she seemed to gear the entire book of quotes or ideas from her family or celebrities, which I was highly disappointed in as it seemed maybe that's the only way she could get her book published. I was disappointed. I imagine it would make a great gift for someone somewhere, but I won't be the one giving it. I hear she's coming out with another book.

Bill Cosby is hilarious - a comic genius. His reactions to events are so spontaneous and creative. I haven't seen another comic quite like him. Best of all, the show's plots are both family-friendly and funny. Unlike modern sit-coms, the characters don't curse and talk about sex every other scene. Rather the episodes are centered around family dramas that are realistic but always resolved well. The cast includes everybody from Phylicia Rashad as the tough and very intelligent Mrs. Huxtable, to the young and adorable Rudy. This makes the show accessible to a wide range of audiences.

I like to sleep with the TV set on a timer at night. And I'll play an entire TV show disc. You can't do that when they remove the entire option like they did with this season. Lastly, they changed the type of case. It is no longer a fold out gate box. It's 3 mini thin DVD cases in a slip case. Not that that's bad, but I hate it when they do that when earlier seasons were different. Your collection will not be uniform. So despite this being a great show.

Overall, I'm very satisfied not only with this saw, but the other Jet stationary tools I've purchased. In order to really exploit the full potential of this saw, rewire it for 230V operation as there is an appreciable difference in power. I do a lot work with 3/4\\" to 1\\" oak, and wired for 230V operation, this saw can handle it.While the fence works well, I do wish it were just a little taller to make it easier to clamp featherboards and auxilary fences to it.

His overseer is well played by Rod Steiger and his team of agents includes Michael York, Robert Joy, and Laurent Malet. They track the terrorists through Europe defusing bombs, hunting down terrorists (including a femme fatale in Karen Racicot), and Avner has second thoughts about the whole mission.The acting and script is believable if not completely true, gripping and intense.

I can give it no greater endorsement than to admit it has forced me to give up my quick naptime between work and making supper for my family so that I can catch the back-to-back episodes each day. I love the humor, the writing, the pace...but mostly the characters. There is nothing cliche about this show: it's that fresh. My whole family laughs and talks together as we watch it (in re-runs on ABC Family). It's a \\"feel-good\\" show that is almost certain to put you in a good mood.

I put the mattress pad and sheet on thinking maybe it will make it a tighter fit but there was still a gap. We took this mattress back and got the Sealy baby soft classic that seems to have the proper fit in our crib.We have a standard size crib so I have no idea why this mattress was not fitting properly.

Now of course these could be no ordinary rats, they must of course be genetically altered creatures in order for this movie to make any sense.The only way to get rid of these rats is to bring in the rat expert, Jack Carver.

He does this by taking certain musical styles, sounds, whatever and moulding them with his unique, sonic signature. This is what makes his \\"SOUND\\". It is futile to compare one album to another with Vangelis' music. With the \\"City\\" Vangelis conjours up an aural tapestry of urban, city dreamscapes. Remember, this is Vangelis and not the Jam! There are no hard edged political statements here!On a shallow level the music is of a very ambient and sort of a late night jazz pastiche. It is very soundtrack orientated as you would expect but it doesn't carry any of the old, analogue syntheziser passages of old. It has a cold feel, very digital and sampled.

Although change is not always bad, this change in Vangelis's music is unwanted.

The only thing I didnt like was the ending cause it's so real, I think everyone can relate to the ending cause we've all had that friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gritty and unsentimental","review":"A good film ... quite possibly a great one ... understated in tone, somber, and remarkably well-acted. Colin Farrell is as fantastic as the critics have said.The film possesses the look of a documentary and succeeds almost on that level, presenting the seemingly senseless brutality of boot camp without glory or heroics. There is nothing gung-ho here about its presentation of war and the psychological effects of it on men forced into situations who have no inclination for it.As for the DVD's special features, check out Colin Farrell's audition segments.Strongly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"FOX wants to steal from you","review":"I would like to think as the previous reviewer who granted one star that the graphic artist is at fault, but given that FOX does this ALL THE TIME, I can only assume it is deliberate. They want people who already own the title in non-anamorphic to purchase it again. They will lie about it to steal from the public. Take a look at ABYSS and True Lies. Both have been released many times with many claims of being anamorphic but not one DVD actually is. When I see anamorphic or enhanced on a fox DVD, I always question if it is true or just another lie. I once complained directly to their website about this issue and they acknowledged it, sent me an envelope to return the disc, which I did. They then sent me the same disc back. I guess this means they are not only dishonest but stupid as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE TIGER EATING HIS TAIL!!","review":"I kept waiting and waiting and waiting, for a tag line to appear or even a character build up. Something!! Jeeeeezzze, what a flop.The only interest here was the pseudo-homosexual overtones of men at war and that was not developed. No wonder I hated that Bat Man movie this guy Directed.At no time was this movie believable.Colin Farrell, prances around like some 'boot-camp-guru',helping guys get out of the service, and although his acting, along with his friend, Matthew Davis, was good, we have to grasp at straws to bring any sense to it all... I gave it a *. Yes one (*)The ending you've seen a thousand times, but mostly its a man and a woman in the crying scene. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against homosexuality in movies, but this movie left us flat on both fronts.This refers to the theatrical release, not the DVD.ciao yaaah69"},{"rating":"2","title":"not your typical military movie","review":"I hate \\"war\\" movies. They are all the same, feature the same characters in the same settings, with the same plots and objectives--or so I thought. Tigerland was a wonderful surprise. This movie, instead of dealing with the soldiers strategy in war, depicting them scared, alone, and in a foreign land, has done something amazing. It instead depicts the soldiers fears, hopes, and dreams BEFORE they go anywhere. These men know where they are going, and that they have no choice in the matter, and watching to see what makes them all tick, or snap, is what is interesting in this fil. \\"Bozz\\" is just the guy they all admire, (or not), because of his facade of a \\"cool\\" guy amidst all the chaos.

Not even that.","review":"After seeing the movie, I was shocked to discover that it was 'based on' a book written by someone who had been through Tigerland himself and served a tour in Vietnam during the period depicted in the film.It would seem that 'based on' leaves a lot of room for artistic liberty. Perhaps the film makers should have set aside more of what was clearly a small budget for the services of a military consultant ...maybe then they wouldn't have referred to a field phone as a 'radio', have been more accurate with the uniforms, and not relied so heavily on dialogue and mannerisms that could have only been based on what someone who had never spent a day in uniform 'thought' soldiers spoke and acted like.This movie needed the services of Dale Dye ...badly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Take a peek","review":"This is the kind of acting we want to see in movies. Colin Farrell is amazing, and his character is quite likeable. Some may claim that this film isn't accurate, but it's main goal is not to be accurate. This isn't a documentary, this is entertainment. Bozz's defiance, unruely antics, and opposition towards pretty much everyone make for a great watch.The \\"party\\" scenes were really uncalled for, and it was quite childish of the director to ad a few very pointless sexual episodes, but that's Hollywood for ya. Definately not for kids (obviously), but it is an entertaining story worth your attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tigerland is a Waste of Time and Money","review":"This movie is ridiculous and the story falls completely flat. Tigerland is a crappy story, with unrealistic dialogue and a bunch of guys who whine a lot and who no one could like. How does a movie like this even get made and distributed? None of the characters are even likable. I wanted to punch Farrell's character in the face.

He manages to save some guys who are too dumb to notice the US Army is run by evil sadistic murders. Farrell manages to save them by getting them discharges before being sent to Vietnam.It is so touching when his friend thanks him for shooting him in the eye so he can get a medical discharge. I almost threw up.Has a couple scenes for homo guys. Also has a gratuitous sex scene that will appeal to bisexuals. Not a surprise considering the director.So, I guess liberals who went to Canada will regret they didn't join up and save people from the Army. But at least they can watch Farrell's character do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This movie is boring as far as war movies go.

This should have been called \\"WHINERLAND\\"!! This film is filled with so much overacting that actual soldiers would tend to find it truly unbelievable. Actor, Tom Guiry, was the worst of the group, delivering a performance that was nearly unbearable to watch. This film was shot in 16mm (an old, low-budget filming method). Although this format works well for some (more artistic) films, it fails miserably for this cinematic bomb. If you are looking for something to put you to sleep, certainly pop this one in your VCR, sit back, and you'll be out like a light in 5 minutes!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Southern Comfort boot camp","review":"Hard to fault Tigerland, other than the fact its treading on such familiar ground. There have been so many boot camp movies made, but thankfully this is one of the better.strangely resonant of Southern Comfort, but lacking the depth and soundtrack.Acting is first rate throughout particuliarly Boz (Farrell), perhaps Hollywood has got it right with the expectant hype surrounding his talent.Production values are very of the moment with washed out grainy colours and atmosphere throughout, and fast edits and camera shakes which are always required but dont get in the way too much.The story could do with a little more depth and pace in places but it works."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME FILM!!","review":"Colin Farrell should have won an Oscar for his performance in this movie! What an outstanding bit of acting! And it helps that he makes my knees weak when I look at him (WOW!)!! Anyway, I found this movie refreshing in the fact that it never actually shows you any Vietnam war footage or anybody killing the enemy. All the actors do such an amazing job considering the conditions they were under (no make-up people, no cafe lattes, no pampering, no fancy-shmancy directors chairs for everyone). They actually made me cry for them and care for them all and wish that I could just enfold them all in my arms to keep these poor boys safe! I absolutely LOVED this film!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A simple yet intriguing film.","review":"After watching Tigerland, you wonder how did Joel Schumacher manage to direct such a simple yet intriguing film after that horrible Batman & Robin? This film is about the loyalty, integrity, fear and hope of men. I believe that the Vietnam War is simply used as a backdrop. This is an intense, psychological film. The plot isn't that great, but it's what Bozz's character that helps this film a very emotional piece. I'd say Colin Farrell is the next Mel Gibson, if not probably even better. After watching this film, there's something about it that makes you feel good, and you wanna enlist yourself to war. A must-see for all."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD was scratched....","review":"The DVD was scratched...missed the return window because I did not watch it right away.

They are rarely cinematic, and just come across as an extended TV sitcom. The Brothers McMullen is just dull, dull, dull. The film is way too long, mainly because the conversations are just so BORING. Burns is a good actor, but he's not a very good director. He has no sense of composition. Burns is a poor man's Kevin Smith, in that Smith has no sense of composition either, but Smith's dialogue is much more livelier than Burns's ever will be (I'm not a huge Smith fan, either). I really don't understand why people loved this film as much as they did, and why critics acted like it was the Citizen Kane of its era. If you really want to see decent talkfests, watch Clerks or some of Richard Linklater's films. Richard's films do maintain interest because the talk is interesting at least (but not always successful). Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing redeeming whatsoever...","review":"There is absolutely no redeeming quality to any of the characters. Zilch.

Any of a dozen actors could have played this part, and maybe even given a break to some talented up and coming actors for a change--could have been big break for them. Well anyway, one part I enjoyed was seeing the future of advertising (I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it, but let's just say, for those who think they have found every way they can reach us to encourage us to buy, they haven't). I think this method could very well be done in the not too distant future. Spooky. I liked the ending myself, I don't find Spielberg's moralizing offensive. The future of incarceration was also very interesting too. Again, won't spoil it, but I could see this being done too.Worth seeing."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT....If you never read the original story.","review":"Why, why, why??? Why not use the plot from the short story in the movie?? Spielberg was \\"keeping it real\\"....real dumb. I guess we were not supposed to miss the original theme and plot of the book due to all the neat special effects. And the ending? Typical Spielberg - don't believe all the \\"dark atmosphere\\" hype, its a joke.Read the Philip K. Dick short story instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Hell of a movie","review":"Dude this is the coolest movie ever Tom Cruse is great in it and dude this is one dark ass film I mean it doesnt really even have a happy ending but the action and plot is good.

All of the actors do a excellent job and after watching you really think about the plot and its many questions.Trust me SEE THIS FANTASTIC MOVIE!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Disappointing but entertaining","review":"This is another one of those movies where it starts well, and builds up and builds up and builds up only to crash the whole thing in 10-30 seconds at the end.The ending was absolutely stupid and ruined the whole movie for me, but up to that point, it was entertaining so it's worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spielberg's best since A.I.","review":"I liked the visuals of the film. I liked how they managed to use simple glass shields and simply pull up what they want. Using mechanical gloves to pull up what they wnat from glass windows is intiuging as the whole precrime idea in the movie. I liked the pumped up action scenes and visuals it has. The plot gets somewhat hazy but has more than enough visuals and strong acting by its lead characters to compensate. I think thsi is one of Tom Cruise's best roles and one of Spielberg's best films. And car fans like me will love the futuristic cars and highways in the movie especially the lexus that Cruise drives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a good movie","review":"Heard a lot about this movie so I decided to check it out it was pretty good there are some corny bits but not many , overall if your just looking for a good movie to watch look no further dudes this is the one"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful piece of sci-fi artistry","review":"This is undoubtedly one of the best sci-fi movies i've seen. The special effects were outstanding. The plot was twisting and very exciting, keeping me on the edge of my seat through the whole movie. I had heard that this movie wasn't going to be too good, but those people who said that are idiots. The only part of the movie that failed for me was the punching sound effects during the fight scenes. Other then that it was a wonderful must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie but too dark.","review":"This movie is one of Spielberg's great movies and it always has that Spielbergian way with a father and a son. The plot is that Tom Anderson (Tom Cruise) is committed for a crime he \\"will\\" committ in the future. So he starts running to find out who framed him and escape from the Precrime force. It sounds kinda repeated but the future side makes it great. The plot has more twists than 1,000 knots which makes it really cool. I haven't tried the DVD yet but I only count it for story but sometimes the DVD matters. But one big problem is the story is very, very dark in the way things happen inside this world. My grade: B+, Great plot, idea, action, and intellengent dialouge but way, way too dark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not play on any devices I have","review":"Ordered 4 of these and none of them played on my computers or my dvd players. all I got was black screen and then shutdown.Returned for replacement, which was done promptly but same result. will have to get this from another supplier."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ending","review":"***** MAJOR SPOILER *****I, like alot of people I know who have seen this film, was disappointed with the ending. However, on reading several comments on imdb.com, I realise that I interpreted the ending all wrong and while I thought it was contrived and happy, it wasn't. The last 15 minutes is not all that it seems - see it again or at the very least try and remember (or find out some other way ;)) what the warden (Gideon) is saying as he is imprisoning John, it puts a different slant on things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blood, guts, gore warning!","review":"This film is rated PG-13 -> there is no way this film is appropriate for a 13 year old child.

Although I can't pass judgement on this film yet, it looks like a work of striking visuals, startling originality, and rare emotional depth. As I said, I haven't seen it yet, but it must be seen in a theater to feel Spielberg's operatic intentions. Rated PG-13 for some violent images."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Disappointment","review":"The film begins well, as a lean mean tech-noir machine. But then it turns into yet another conspiracy thriller, and a more than usually transparent one, at that. Add a couple of holes in the story that you could push a planet through (Doesn't anyone at the PreCrime Center think of changing their locks?) and the requisite sentimental family affirming stuff, and you have yet another Spielberg film that hasn't the slightest idea of what it really wants to be, and ends up trying to be everything at once, and falls apart in the process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spielberg, With Cruise, Lose Their Minds","review":"Alongside the likes of HARRY POTTER, MOULIN ROUGE, and SPIDER-MAN, the great Steven Spielberg succumbed to pressure and made one of the films that, arguably, is destined for the trash heap of film history. MINORITY REPORT is just plain bad ... unimaginative in every aspect of its presentation. Cruise's acting (or lack thereof) has never been more central to a film's failure as it is here.At best, REPORT serves as what happens when two great minds get together ... and then forget that they have to have a credible story first."},{"rating":"1","title":"All special effects, poor storyline, poor movie","review":"Rent if you must but don't waste your money on buying this one. The story is lame. Special effects are sooo unrealistic.Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHO DIRECTED THIS?","review":"The Goonies was great. I really liked it. I thought that it was one of Speilberg's good ideas. I think that Speilberg should direct more movies. He's really talented, but a lot of people don't know who he is. One of his best films was FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF. It was really good. I hear he's gonna make a great movie about dinosaurs, but I think that's just gossip. I think he should work with George Lucas. It is a rumor that they are going to make a movie together with Harrison Ford. If the movie is liked by reviewers, I also hear that they may make a sequel to it with the little kid from GOONIES. It is supposed to be about some archeologist who saves the world a lot. Hey, maybe Speilberg should work with Tom Cruise, whose recent work includes RISKY BUSINESS and THE MATRIX. By the way, I hear MINORITY REPORT is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"quality is bad","review":"The quality of the film is bad: grainy, blurry; and the color is pale blue (as the image on the cover of the case)!!!

How about an intelligently written plot? You won't find one in this movie.Apparently the special effects (which were already dated when the movie was released), some decent photography and Tom Cruise were all this movie ever had going for it. But that's not enough. Stupidly written movie with major holes in the plot and a depressing story.Bad bad bad movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"A Steven Spielberg sci fi film starring Tom Cruise can create a lot of hype and expectations and unfortunately this film fails to live up to them. The film's first twenty minutes are compelling but once Cruise has to go on the run the film falls apart. The action scenes in this movie are laughable and their is far too much CGI. The process of how the precogs determine the future is not explained well enough either. Spielberg last great film was Jurassic Park and he has been slipping ever since, by focusing too much on effects and not on relatable charachters or compelling story."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Spielberg's best Action flick , no doubt!\\"","review":"This is a great movie , it has wonderful action scenes , and above all it is pure entertainment! Tom Cruise is at his best despite his earlier failures (Far and Away , Mission Imposible 2), and since Vanilla Sky he has made pretty decent films. It has an awesome plot line , however , there is one little thing that makes me mad about this movie. The girl who plays one of the clone people , has an annoying voice. Her screaming sounds like a cow being punched in the nuts! Besides that I think most people will find it quite entertaining. Starring: Tom Cruise ,Max von Sydow and Colin Farrel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom Cruise a robot?!!","review":"It was pretty hard to believe that Tom Cruise plays a robot in Minority Report. He acts so human and normal, (unlike the masterful performance from Haley Joel Osmand in A.I.) Then again, Tom Cruise is one of the greatest actors alive,so, perhaps it's hard for him to act with little emotion...Unlike Jurrasic Park, there are no dinasours, which may confuse people who read the title.However, like Schindler's List,Speilberg makes a great entertainment picture about events and things that only a genius can think of!Speilberg, good for you...although Cruise doesn't look like a mecca, you sure do make another great holocust film."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a weak movie with a few good action scenes...","review":"Somewhere I heard that this is supposed to be as good or better than the Matrix, nothing could be farther from the truth. The good...it has a few cool scenes like the car rides, spiders, computer displays, chase scenes...that is not enough to make a movie good, it needs something else...can Spielberg say \\"good story/plot?\\". Special effects are pretty good, but I have seen better. The bad...the plot is very dull and stupid. It is all about how one man trips out over and over and over and over about his missing/dead son that dissapeared 6 years ago. The other part of the plot is about who killed the mother of a super future seeing psychic. Someone frames him, he runs and that is when you get the good action scenes. It has lots of talking and it leads not to something grand but in the end it is just another \\"who done it\\" movie. Dont waste your money in the theaters like I did, just rent it...if you MUST see it in theaters PLEASE see the matinee..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of Bells and Whistles,","review":"but that's about it. Some of the effects are really cool to look at, but the mixture of mod-tech with a realtively visually unchanged rest of the world looked off to me. Also, the story is pretty pedestrian in spite of it's excellent premise. Underneath all of the fancy gadgets and clever lights is the same old tired mystery that is too easy to figure out. Cruise is neither a great actor nor action hero(although he does display some good pantomime skills)and should start to rethink his carreer choices. Anyway, it's fun to look at for the first 90 of its' 225 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well.....","review":"I am a huge Speilberg fan, and i was very disappointed at this flick, i found my-self struggling to stay interested, the bottom line? It was to long, to long for its own good, i am glad i did not go see this in the movies, cause i would have for sure dozed off. The dvd set has great features on it, i guess if your a fan of Tom, you should get it, but i would recommend renting it first, then see if you want to buy it, cause it's defitnitley not a film you'll watch over and over again.IMO"},{"rating":"2","title":"We Can See You Murder...","review":"Detective John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is working on the pre-crime division that prevents murders by seeing into the future through three pre-cogs, gifted individuals that can see into the future through dreams. John firmly believes in a pre-crimes system, but there are those who have a different opinions such as detective Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell). Shortly after Witwer's arrival, the pre-cogs have dream of John being a murderer, which is shocking to John. A stunned John escapes the pre-crime unit while trying to figure out who is setting him up, after all John has never meet this stranger that he supposedly will kill. Minority Report is an exciting sci-fi film that has many interesting viewpoints that will entertain the audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks....","review":"one of the most stupid movies i have ever seen and i used to work for blockbuster INC....."},{"rating":"1","title":"lousy, boring, and underdone","review":"I was truly disappointed in this movie. I had such hopes, and with Steven doing the directing how could it go wrong? It needed a little more schindlers list, and a little less humor, though. It was distracting to be in the midst of an exciting chase/action scene that would be broken up with a scene aimed at humor. Why did he bother? And the ending? I won't give it away, but it ruined the whole thing. The only ending I am looking forward to is the ending of Tom Cruises career. Many said he acted very well in this movie, but I wasn't moved at all. I tried to watch this lousy waste of time 3 times before sitting through it for a whole performance, and I still can't figure out why I bothered. The biggest mystery in the movie is dispelled too soon, and the only mystery left is why people would tell their friends to spend 8 dollars to see it at the theater. I can't wait for it to come out on DVD--I need a new coaster for my coffee table."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre at best","review":"This movie is mediocre at best. It does have some wonderful elements like the advertising that addresses you by name. It's main problem though is that it's overly ambitious. It just tries to do too many things and doesn't do half of them well. The nods to Blade Runner and Brazil are unmistakable and inferior. On the other hand it's much better than the mess that was A.I."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise are capable of making much better movies than this. It was O.K but I certainly would never watch it ever again it is a little too long and overdone. The color of it for one thing was annoying it was dark blue and tinted looking. Movies like that are terrible once you get out of the theater try driving home in the bright sunshine after watching this movie. I hope the future never gets this annoying. If you are into future type movies that are real space age looking this kind of movie may suit you Spielberg needs to go back to movies like E.T and Back to the future and Cruise should go back to plots similar to stuff earlier in his career. This movie bombed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and Cliched","review":"After reading many great reviews of this movie, I was very disappointed when actually trying to view it. I found it predictable and cliched. The scenes are depicted like all 'future' type scenes where the living environment is done in silver and black. As if no one in the future likes to live in soft, comfortable environments. I just think that's stupid. I found the entire plot weak. It was a little more harsh than it needed to be as well. Cruise was fine, as always, but nothing that stands out. Overall a real bummer. Not worth buying in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"COP OUT..........?","review":"A great deal distracts from this simple story, especially the in your face 2054 commercials ...... all of this could be said in far less time.AND are we still paying homage to Kubrick [the soft, misty focus], or is it a colorized Lang, maybe even Dreyer [especially the Samantha Morton/Falconetti/Maria-Metropolis look]?Ridley Scott said it much better in the earlier and far superior \\"Bladerunner\\".You just don't feel anything for the characters. And what's with the Medusa plants, and that stuff? AND what's also with the \\"Seventh Seal\\" reprise on the balcony at the end - complete with the original Bergman star? [The Hooded 'death-figure'???]Even 'Logan's Run' gave more fun.This one's awfully close to being a prequel to \\"A.I.\\"Granted Colin Farrell and Samatha Morton bring a fresh breath to the screen, but the rest ...... all sound - little fury, emotion or anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Confusing","review":"I hate to go against the majority but the best two words to describe this movie are in my title. I'm just glad I saw my friend's DVD before I wasted any of my money on it. I think Spielburg should stay away from adult science-fiction. Everything looked like it was lifted from another science-fiction movie. I know that that is very common in sci-fi movies but when you mix unoriginal effects with a boring, confusing plot, and actors that probably shouldn't be there, it makes for one stinker of a movie. Sometimes there movies that you don't completely get on the first viewing but you want to watch it again to figure it out, this is not one of those movies. I just don't see why this movie was such a critical hit. I believe if it where done by anyone else but Spielburg and Cruse it would have been panned like it should have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spielberg in decline","review":"Spielberg has obviously bought into the Hollywood mindset that the more gore, the more gross you can be, the better. What happened to his great storytelling ability?! What a disappointing movie. If you like graphic violence, if you enjoy watching snot dripping and people eating rotting food this movie is for you. And if you believe we will be driving cars up and down the sides of buildings in 50 years, you will believe this unbelieveable movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing effects, great plot idea, horrible movie","review":"Of the 2.5 hours of this movie, I would say that 30 minutes are actually enjoyable. The effects are stunning, and the plot seems to have an excellent twist-until the end where we get the standard Hollywood ending of 'happily ever after'. This would not be an issue if the rest of the movie was better. The movie proceeds along slowly with a few excellent action scenes and a few good dramatic scenes-the jet pack chase, the Lexus car chase and the scene in the greenhouse come to mind. However there are many long empty parts of the movie where nothing happens. No suspense, no commentary, no acting-nothing. The characters are a mixed bag: Tom Cruise is better than he was in MI2, but most of the other actors are sub-par.I could go on, but then this review would be just like the movie-too long and not worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"AUDIO TRACK AVAILABLE","review":"MEN WHO SPEAK FRENCH : MINORITY REPORT FROM USA (ZONE 1) HAVE FRENCH AUDIO TRACK AVAILABLE ! and IT's A GOOD QUALITY !VERY GOOD MOVIE, THANKS TOM CRUISE !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Questions","review":"This is a very entertaining movie.

Ever since he 'went serious' he's produced pretentious, bloated and strangely vapid films like this. The plot is ridiculous. There is a simply horrid scene with a Russian doctor and nurse with a giant mole... I mean c'mon why focus on the giant mole? Is this what watching too much Kubrick does to otherwise competent directors??? To think this guy once made Indiana Jones.Spielberg is a one-dimensional and not particularly artistic director, he should not endeavour to make 'edgier' films because the result is stuff like this, neither edgy nor entertaining, just self-involved, overlong and ultimately, boring, which cinematically speaking, is just about the worst crime you could commit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Concept; execution overblown","review":"This was an interesting effort; unfortunately, the movie ran about a half hour (or more) too long.It should have ended when \\"Anderton\\" was captured andand imprisoned in deep freeze -THE END - rather than using every alternate plot twist and ending they had apparently filmed, stitched together."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd need an entire fleet of trucks...","review":"...as many as I could find just to drive through SOME of the many holes in this plot.For the life of me I can't understand why this film has been so well received critically.My wife and I discussed this film's failures for two full days after viewing it.

Generally, when Big Name Directors and Big Name Stars get together to make a Big Money Film, only mediocrity results. Plus, it seems that every time you turn around someone is making a film of a Philip K. Dick story.Fortunately, I was wrong. Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise combine forces to make what is really a substantial thriller with a science-fiction leaning. The story and the characters are what really make this work--particularly Samantha Morton's performance as Agatha the pre-cog.Also fun are the in-joke cameos (Cameron Crowe, Paul Thomas Anderson, Cameron Diaz) and the references to Stanley Kubrick films (particularly A Clockwork Orange) and other films based on Philip K. Dick stories.It's not a classic in any sense, but Minority Report is a fun, fast-paced thriller with a brain and a message."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Thrilling Sci-Fi Ride--Spielberg and Cruise are wonderful!","review":"I can't possibly understand how anyone **couldn't** like this movie. It's just beautiful; the futuristic plot and special effects ought to be enough to suck you in right away. If you like movies that involve plenty of twists and turns, this one is for you. When I saw it last summer, I was at a loss; none of the events in the movie seemed to be helping Cruise solve his mystery. But I should have known to just sit back and trust Steven Spielberg, because it all ties together in a haunting climax. Anyone who doesn't love this doesn't know what they're missing. The DVD was filled with plenty of extras, you get an entire second disk devoted to the futuristic themes of the film, as well as Steven and Tom's take on the future of pre-crime. I bought this DVD the day it came out (December 17th, 2002), and I'm still not tired of watching it. Get it now before you miss out on a masterpiece!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting","review":"This DVD is good enough to see, especially if you like Tom Cruise flicks. Set in futuristic looking Washington, DC, Minority Report takes you on a wild ride of pre-knowledge crime solving. Police, in the future, have developed a way to know how and when crimes are going to take place, so they arrest people before the crimes are committed. This leads to a 0 murder rate in DC, and seemingly the world the way we want it. Tom Cruise is the chief officer in charge of this program and he is a borderline burnout who struggles with drugs. That alone, the fact that Tom Cruise plays a burnout, should make it worth seeing this film. With that said, this movie plays like cops and robbers and the action is intense. Cruise is a great main character and the end will leave you guessing.

It was good, although the sound went out during the intial fight & chase scene. But a lot of stuff still didn't make sense to me, and I hate it when actors whisper so utterly low...I have decent hearing but I can't hear that in a crowded theater. I wanted to watch this again at home, with captions on to make sure I didn't miss any dialog. Which is what I would recommend to a lot of the poeple here who are saying that the plot isn't complete and explained...EVERYTHING IS EXPLAINED, WATCH THE MOVIE AGAIN, THIS TIME PAY CAREFUL ATTENTION.

I actually would not have rated Minority Report as highly the first time I saw it, but it only improved in subsequent viewings. This is really everything a movie should be.

The premise... is fascinating, but ...the ending is so entirely foreseeable that a viewer wonders, \\"Shouldn't I be one of the members serving on the precognition unit?\\"The effects-laden chase sequences are eye candy to behold (it is Spielberg, after all), and Cruise does stretch his acting beyond his usual aplomb (it is Tom Cruise, after all).

And Tom's acting leaves a lot to be desired. Since ol' Steven made this, I thought it was OKAY, but the ending is really GOOD, the first time around. Watching it again made the movie boring since you can see everything that led to the impressionable ending of this movie. All in all, this movie is less than OKAY.

With the exception of Samantha Morton who spends most of the film acting like an epileptic in a see-thru bodysuit. The remainder of the cast cast gives us such bad performances that even Cruise seems lifelike next to them. If you see this film, remember that in the year 2054, there are no computer networks, nobody changes the locks, and even three precognitive kids that can predict murder couldn't predict how terrible this film was going to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"This REPORT is WASTing ur TIME...","review":"If u watch this 136+min report, u are wasting ur time.I totally agree TAO's comment:\\"The theatrical trailer is all that you've seen.\\"and, it's no any new idea...If u like CG/SFX, I recommend:\\"Johnny Mnemonic\\" - the VR Interface of computer.\\"Red Planet\\" ------ the Transparent displayer of computer.\\"Lost in Space\\" --- the Cyber-Spider.Finally, again, this movie is ..., it's a ...

The lighting was too bright or overexposed. I suppose it was supposed to put me in mind of the future, but all it really did was annoy me. I had figured out who the bad guy was about 1 hour before the movie revealed it. And what about a little better attention to the details. How long did Cruise carry that pair of eyeballs with him and they hadn't deteriorated??? Now if he were such a big criminal, wouldn't they have shut down his access?????"},{"rating":"1","title":"really good movie, very lame DVD","review":"For some reason, the lighting on this DVD doesn't match the movie shown in the theatre. All of the light colors are amplified to a very bright white and the darker colors are hidden in black shadows. Everything has an intense aura and anything that light strikes becomes a bright white spot on the screen. Background objects and occasionally even faces are hidden by this effect making the movie almost impossible to watch.It seems unlikely that this was an accident. It might be an attempt at art where the viewer gets to use their imagination to fill in the void of intense whites and shadows that occupy each scene...what an unfortunate loss of an otherwise decent movie. Maybe a cleaned-up, watchable version will surface somewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's cute but,,,,","review":"Tom really has great looks it's just to bad that with each passing film his acting gets worse. I went to see this film knowing of the special effects which i always hate in movies but i did want to see Tom and see how this messures up to some of his other films. To me \\"Top Gun\\" is the only good film he ever made. As far as production value this film doesn't go anywhere and nothing ties it together except for Tom smiling, posing, and trying to look good and not get his hair to messed up.I've never been a big fan of Spielberg. He tries to hard all the time to make a good film and in my eyes doesn't have much success. Of course box office will always prove me wrong. But i don't think the american audience demands good acting pictures anymore and they count on special effects to pull them threw a movie which Spielberg is good at.I wasn't impressed but Tom is still good to look at. I wonder if he could make it on Broadway?"},{"rating":"1","title":"STUPID MOVIE EVER!!","review":"All I can say is: DON'T PAY TOO MUCH ATTENTION TO THE SCREENPLAY!

I found myself looking at my watch every 10 mintues waiting for the ridiculously long, stupid movie to end. I've never walked out of a film before, but my friends and I were seriously considering doing just that. The plot had more holes than a block of swiss cheese. Visually it was a mess, some scenes were very technical and futuristic, and some scenes were set on a farm in the Chesapeake Bay. My friend that had been holding out hope through the first half that the movie would get better finally gave up when on the lawn of a woman who's son had been missing for over 6 years, there was a rusted out tricycle. Give me a break! Avoid this movie at all costs. We even told people in line as we left to go see something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Long","review":"Although the special effects were good I found the film to be long and boring. I kept thinking it was going to end but it seemed to go on forever. Went with a friend and she as well was unimpressed. I realize most people seem to be giving this film a high rating but I guess it was just not for me. Not even the color of the film was impressive as it seemed dark and blue tinted. I would not ever sit through this again. I guess my report fits the title minority report as my views are in the minority of other reviewers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Visuals, Horrible Film","review":"I guess I am in the Minority.I am not a Tom Cruise fan at all. And with such a great story at the core of the film, it should have been used as the sequel to TOTAL RECALL. Personally I would have liked to have seen Arnie, or at the Very Least Paul Verhoeven, do this story in their own way.Visually nice, and Tom Cruise do not a good film make."},{"rating":"1","title":"Minority Retort","review":"Over-hyped, over-budgeted film of an interesting book. Sure, there are intriguing paradoxes thrown up by the idea of future actions being used to guide our present paths - but done in such a ham-fisted way as this, with the ubiquitous \\"can we make another mission impossible please\\" Cruise in the leading role shreds what little credibility the idea had to begin with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Great","review":"What makes Minority Report so great? Is it Cruises 'man on the run' acting? Spielberg's top notch directing? The 'well that could happen...' factor? It's all of these rolled into an enjoyable summer movie package. Not only does it look phenominal, but it provides an extremely great mix of action and food for thought. Some of the comedy seemed a bit silly, the eyeballs..., but it's very easy to overlook them. I must admit it was pushing the PG-13 rating and had a lot of squeemish thrills. Not a great summer movie, a great movie period."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE GENIUS OF SPIELBERG!","review":"What an imagination this guy has!

Plu-eez!! That's why I think it's badly cast. I cared more about Danny in the movie than I did Tom Cruise's character. Great idea, loved the idea of the pre-cogs and would have liked to see more of their work catching pre-criminals etc. and more of the pre-cogs' past. But it was a good story.I figured out who the \\"baddy\\" was very early on in the movie, so that's why I call the movie predictable.

Through all of the scepticisim Anderton believes his program is without flaw, until his fate is put in the program.Without giving away spoilers, I can't say to much more about this film, only that it has great acting in Tom Crusie and great direction from Steven Speilberg."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOR-ING!","review":"Meant to be a copy of The Matrix and similar \\"sci fi\\" movies, i guess. To me, not much is dumber than a special effects movie in which the special effects are totally unconvincing -- like this. Very little plot, just an intro used as an excuse for another chase movie. Everything is blue, for some reason (another irritating affectation). No daylight ever appears, everyone and everything is blue.

Set in the year 2054, the story has scenery very similar to that presented in Blade Runner.Without giving any of the crucial elements away, I will summarize the description of the movie by saying that it is essentially Gattaca meets The Fugitive, in the sense that the protagonist, John Anderton, is involved in several chase scenes, perpetually eluding authorities who are maintaining a conceptually flawed, futuristic, Brave New World society."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dull and predictable","review":"This was a highly anticipated movie for me turned out to be very very dull and very very predictable.

I always like to see how some directors picture the future and Spielberg always delivers.

I enjoyed watching this movie for the third time and will watch it again in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome finish","review":"Movie gets better everytime I watch it! The best part is the first half of the movie is good, but the second half blows you away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic SciFi Thriller","review":"Great movie, destined to be listed as one of the great futuristic thrillers of all time. A must see for avid movie watchers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining adaptation of Dick's classic short story","review":"\\"Minority Report,\\" like \\"Bladerunner,\\" is based on a Philip K. Dick story (although this time a short story). The plot revolves around a future where murders have almost been eliminated, thanks to a technology that allows the protagonist, John Anderton (played by Tom Cruise) to see into the future and stop a murderer before the act has been committed. The plot, which is excellent, is only half of the reason this film makes the list. The film resembles \\"Bladerunner,\\" in more ways than having been based on a Dick story; the world it takes place in is beautifully detailed and believable, one in which scanners on billboards read your identity and then produce a specialized advertisement just for you. The future portrayed is believable, both gritty and sleek, and the ethical questions raised by the film are especially poignant as we increasingly live a world were we are videoed, photographed, and observed on a greater, and greater level."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO much better than expected","review":"I had seen AI shortly before this and thought that movie was boring, I was sorely disappointed. I went in to this thinking it was going to be similar - but it was great! It's about a police officer in the future, working in a unit called \\"Pre-Crime.\\" They have the ability to see crimes of the future due to these three pre-cognitive beings. When the message comes that the main character (Tom Cruise) is the next murderer, he has to rush to clear his name. The story has a lot of suspense and twists, but not too many to make it laughable. I thoroughly enjoyed it - I bought the DVD as soon as it came out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"I have to say i am a huge Speilberg fan, but i was pretty disappointed by this. The premis is brillant, a pre-crime divison, that's a brillant story, but i don't think it was taken to it's full potential. I found myself struggling to stay interested, because it was so long. It's so long it's just boring, some parts of the movie wasn't necessary, it could have been left out to cut time down. If i went to the movies and saw this i would have for sure dozed off. Tom Cruise gives a great performance, as always, but i think this movie was way overated.That's my 2 cents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging, gripping ... some relevance to today","review":"...I found the movie to be quite worthwhile. It held my attention for the full 2 1/2 hours. The future does look pretty grim and the idea of being imprisoned for a 'pre-crime' is quite compelling. It reminds me a bit of the situations some of the 'enemy combatants' our Gov't is currently holding. How about a National ID Card' = an eye scan. After 9/11/01 some of the issues present seem more relevant.Even though some big companies paid [alot of money]for visibility I thought that the use of technology for marketing by eye scan to be not too futuristic at all. Isn't this just a more advanced concept of web personalization ...?"},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie was something else","review":"I don't even know how to explain this film.

I have seen a lot of films, but this was really good."},{"rating":"1","title":"another blunder os Spierlberg","review":"The movie it's very claustrophobic, with all that technology and commercial messages.

This movie does not compare to Blade Runner, it's not Tom Cruise's best performance and if you're a Philip K. Dick fan, you'll be as disappointed as you were by Total Recall( a whole 'nother story, although I usually like Roger Zelazny). About all I brough home from this movie was that they had a big special-effects budget and Lexus has a new car they're promoting. There were only distant, tangental relationships to the short story that this movie took it's name from. Like Total Recall, the protaganist has the same name as the story and there are elements of the original story in the plot line, but they're few and far between. If you feel you have to own it, buy it used, otherwise rent it and then let someone else be plagued by it later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major logical flaw","review":"As other reviewers have noted, this movie has some logical flaws. That alone is not necessarily a show stopper. But the problem for me was that the major logical flaw (Cruise's \\"crime\\" being seen by the precons) was just too big a mistake, and effectively destroyed the movie for me. It's too bad because the movie contains some interesting ideas and compelling visuals, but I felt pretty deflated when I realized that the screenwriters took a major shortcut, which to my mind, means they didn't accord their audience the proper amount of respect. I also generally like Tom Cruise, but I didn't like his performance much in this movie. Part of the reason is probably because Colin Farrell was in this movie and I don't like his energy as an actor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't bear to watch this rubbish for more than 30 minutes","review":"Sure the acting was nice, the effects awesome, but this was one boring movie (that's just from a visceral point of view w/o any specifics). One major gripe of mine is that this movie tried being metaphysical in terms of predestination and intellectual time travel. No matter how carefully you craft your plot and script, there's bound to be gaps too big to fill in a couple hours. So if the metaphysics is a deal breaker and there's no other action elsewhere, there's no point watching this waste of celluloid."},{"rating":"1","title":"I watched it!","review":"I suppose this movie could have been deeper if I was intoxicated but, unfortunately I was not able to get into it as much as I thought I would have.Tom Cruise certainly has a way to catch the audience with his facial expressions and active moments throughout the scenes, but it is not enough to make you sit still throughout the movie. In fact, you would probably want to change to regular TV about 20 minutes into it. There is too much going on for a plot that seems to be so simple... Mystery with drama(extremely exaggerated). I know the director wanted high-tech scenes and special effects...but give me a break. Maybe if the special effects weren't so much, the director could've concentrated more on bringing the authentic storyline out.The conclusion of the movie left me as blank as the emoticon on msn and emotionless. Don't take my word for it, watch the movie. Film is a form of art, but this is definitely a piece that has left a frown on my face and my head cocked to the side.Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Movie","review":"Although some people take to the tv screen just as much as the Movie screen I particularly enjoyed in more for a larger screen. But besides that, the plot is very enticing and the characters very well acted. But unfortunately I wouldn't buy this to own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Though it seems this DVD has been released for ever, I just got it. I was very sorry I did.The plot is okay, somewhat convoluted, with Tom Cruise evading the precrime cops while trying to prove his innocence for a murder he will commit in 36 hours. Odd sounding but that's why I thought I'd like it.However, the filmmaking was horrible. Its either too dark to make much out or its so bright everything has that soap opera glare to it. And the action scenes were also poorly done - at one point you can clearly see a wire on Tom Cruise, and that's without using any DVD features! I was so disappointed with the quality of the movie that I didn't even get to the second disk to see the extras."},{"rating":"2","title":"Minority Report, a sweet dlight","review":"I loved Minority Report,a clever story and amazing special effects made for a great futuristic experience.

This is one of two books that every serious student of business should have in his or her library; the other is \\"You Can Win at Office Politics,\\" by Dr. Robert Bell.

If you are more the intellectual movie type, you probably will like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A failed experiment?","review":"'Heart of Glass' was quite the daring experiment from the extraordinary German filmmaker Werner Herzog. He hypnotized all the actors except one man; a mystic who is trying to save a village from destroying itself. The scenery is stunning and so is the music. The yodeling at the begging of the film is hair-raising and unforgettable. Other than that, 'Heart of Glass' does not make any sense, espicially the last scene. The final scene has nothing to do with the main story. The final scene has nothing to do with anything in general. Also, the hypnotized actors look goofy and silly most of the time rather than being in a trance-like state. It is a good thing when artists try to experiment like this, but in this case, I would consider the experiment a failure. Watch some other Herzog films, especially the ones with Klaus Kinski."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hypnotic","review":"Herzog is a master of the off-beat (though I cannot recommend some of his recent films like 'Cobra Verde and 'Invincible'). His approach in 'Heart of Glass' is experimental and strangely beautiful. It has a sort of contemplative, mystical feel - with some of the greatest imagery put to film since the silent era. Along with Tarkovsky, Herzog is one of the greatest directors at capturing atmosphere and completely absorbing his audience with it - whether or not they are prepared for such a journey. I am not at all surprized by some of the negative reviews of this film - as it is out of the ordinary - but for me it is out of the ordinary in a transcendental way - like all great works of art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Susan Hayward","review":"Susan Hayward is by far one of the greatest actresses that ever worked in film.

I am now in the process of buying Jane Froman CD's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jane Froman story","review":"This has always been my favorite musical,it has everything.

She remains my favorite actress to this day. Let us not forget Thelma Ritter, Hayward's sidekick in the movie, who should have won an Oscar for her superb acting. I've been checking for years to see whether the movie had been released on DVD, and here it is....at long last!!! Enjoy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FINALLY! The Best Musical Bio Is Coming!","review":"Without a doubt, this is the best musical biography ever made! Susan Hayward worked closely with Jane Froman, studying her gestures, delivery, and style. The two became close friends in the course of the project. The result is a seamless lip-synching of songs by Hayward over the most perfect mezzo voice of Ms. Froman. (The voice is an instrument with perfect vibrato.)Thelma Ritter was nominated for an Oscar as Best Supporting Actress and delivers a tremendous performance as Nurse Clancey. She was a very special actress!The combination of songs from a variety of composers is stellar. The dance production for \\"With a Song in My Heart\\" is gorgeous and simply soars! The strings are marvelous, and the male dance lead is brilliant.I thought I was destined to enjoy this classic only on a grainy VHS recording made from a TV broadcast. Thank goodness for a restored DVD! I can hardly wait for my copy to arrive. Then I, too, will have a song in MY heart!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Grand Finale","review":"I watched \\"With a Song in My Heart\\" the other day and I wouldn't have bothered to write a review of it except that I was blown away by the USO-style musical finale. The movie itself was a standard Hollywood inspirational biography and, in this case, I hadn't even heard of the subject. However, I got to hear a lot of Jane Froman because it was her voice that we heard coming out of Susan Hayward's mouth. (Incidently, wasn't that an awesome lip-sincing display Miss Hayward put on!?!) Anyway the movie moved along with the help of David Wayne and a lot of very good songs (but not much else). However, the last major scene was of Miss Froman singing to GI's at a hospital (somewhere in Europe if I'm not mistaken). The resulting assortment of American-themed music and the style it which it was delivered stole the show. I watched it on Veteran's Day and, inasmuch as I didn't do much else to celebrate the day, I came away glad I watched \\"With a Song in My Heart\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another purchase for mom","review":"This was another movie I purchased for my mom as a christmas gift.

After shedding my goosebumps I remembered that it came from an Academy Award movie in my young days. I did an online search and up it came. I didn't even dream it was still available. But Amazon had it. I ordered it because my very musical granddaughter has grown to love movie music and broadway. I would love to hear her sing this song.

In every way Susan Hayward became Jane Froman before the days of the charade called lipsinquing. It is not a trip back into nostalgia but rather gives us a glimpse of another time and place that shaped the characters of those who lived through those years.

It gave a better grip but didn't help with the spring tension."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like a charm!","review":"I carry a G27 as my backup gun and when I qualified with it I was having a hard time keeping a grip after each shot (.40 is a bit snappy) but once I put this on my groups got much better and I feel like I can actually trust this gun with my life now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should have been factory","review":"The grip extension should have come on the Glock 27 straight from the factory. The handgun now fits my hand perfectly, and the low profile curve doesn't make the grip look too long for the short slide of the model 27. If you are not familiar with switching magazine plates then the process can be a little tricky, but the end result is well worth it with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"Bought this for my girls Glock 26. What a difference! Now I don't have to tuck my pinky under the magazine. I did have some trouble taking off the bottom/spring plate on the magazine so I took it to a authorized Glock dealer who took it off with no problem. I must have loosened it for him. Ha! Now I have read other customer's fingers being pinched by this extension. That has not been the case for me or my girl. We have put well over 200 rounds through it without any pinch or discomfort. Very happy with the grip extension."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small for larger hands","review":"Pearce has great products but this one doesn't work the best for my Glock 27. First it was tough to replace the original mag plate to add this one. And then it doesn't really add the surface needed for my pinky. I ordered the larger one which add two more rounds for what should be the right fit. I'd only recommend for someone with smaller hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheaper than getting a bigger gun","review":"I installed these on my Glock 27 magazines. Overall, the flat bases were fine, but I was not completely happy drawing from a concealed carry position. I was looking at going with a Glock 23 or 19. I may do that later, but, for now, these extensions help me with my grip.Please note a couple things: These are not the ones to add round capacity to the magazine; they are just to help those who want help with grip. Also, you should have a Glock tool or something like it. The Glock bases come off easily if you do things right. It is not like those metal magazines you may have disassembled. You can look up videos on YouTube to see how it is done. The Glock tool needed to go in deeper and wedge the spring before I could remove the base. The magazines really do not squeeze in on the sides as the directions seemed to say. The Glock tool actually gave me the leverage to get the original base off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunate...","review":"I hate that this didn't work out, seemed like a great idea for more grip but I found EVERY TIME I fired, there was a little space between the grip and the extension causing it to pinch my pinky finger on absolutely every shot. There was no getting used to it unfortunately so I had to remove it and go back to the regular ol' mag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely necessary","review":"Grip extension is absolutely necessary for Glock 26/27.

I found two things particularly annoying about the movie. First, you end up hating all the people in the beach \\"commune\\" as they reveal themselves to be totally caught up in themselves and having their fun - they even abandon an injured guy in the woods because his cries of agony bring their party down. Second, Leo goes kind of nuts at the end for no real reason (at least that the film provides). Pretty soon you start hoping that he finally jumps off a cliff so that the film can mercifully end.The scenery in the film is magnificent and the actors seem to be well cast. The problem is there doesn't seem to be any point or redeeming qualities to take away from the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"this flicck belondgs somehwre ona abeach far way!","review":"I honestly can;t get why epople have decdiedd to get behind this movie.

There is always an adventure if someone travels outside the normal tourist destinations although maybe not as much as this film indicates. It still shows what can really happen in an isolated culture. I'd love it if adventure were that accessible!Foreign characters are much more forgiving than with real life ex-pats. They seem to want the foreigners living there much more than is the case in real life. Nevertheless, the feeling of being in a place where it is accepted that you can do as you want is conveyed really well. As long as you don't break \\"their rules.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"An Underrated Adventure","review":"I know, I know, it's not the book. Guess what? No movie is. Standing on it's own, I think it's one of the more underrated adventure movies out there. It has some great actors/actresses from around the world (Virginie Ledoyen, Tilda Swinton)-- even Leonardo, who I don't normally like, is the perfect fit for a brash, somewhat phony but adventurous American. Fantastic, beautiful, on location scenery in Thailand: places I had been, that I had seen. It has great narrative from the book. A great haunting soundtrack (UNKLE, Moby, Leftfield, Underworld). It's also got a kind of innocent magic to it-- which, i can tell you from traveling, is true and real-- and then the loss of that magic, which is also part of the story. Give it a chance, forget what other people say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the novel","review":"I think it's interesting how many folks say they preferred the novel to the film. I read the book first, and as a longtime Thailand traveler, I found it very 'fake' feeling. To me, Danny Boyle and his screenwriter came closer to the feel of Thailand's backpacker world.I also thought the film has considerably more dramatic arc to the story. Alex Garland's prose was pathetic in places. While not a five-star film, it was certainly entertaining. (I'd give the novel two stars, by comparison.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"very enjoyable","review":"I don't understand why everyone rags on this movie. I never get sick of it and everytime I watch, I'm hooked from beginning to end. It's a fascinating story and the characters are all likeable in their own ways. I couldn't help but think that this movie was somewhat like an adult version of \\"Lord of the Flies.\\" DiCaprio is a brilliant actor and this a 5-star movie in my mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"PERFECT BEACH. UNEVEN FLICK.","review":"The most beautiful of all movie beaches is probably the one in this unsatisfying film with a tantalizing premise and breathtaking, dreamlike imagery, starring Leonardo Dicaprio as an amoral, cowardly pothead who seeks to live his life as a videogame. Danny Boyle directs with a reserve that is unlike his turn in \\"Transpotting.\\" So turn down the sound, forget the story, and get lost in the beauty of a living Eden."},{"rating":"1","title":"This 'Beach' needs to be washed away","review":"I had the misfortune to view this movie, and it stinks like a rotting seagull. A meandering mess of a flick, with no merits whatsoever, other than some nice scenery. Most ridiculous is the ending when DiCaprio is looking at a pic of him and his fellow beach dwellers after he returns to society, reminiscing about the happy times there. What he seems to have forgotten is that pretty much everyone on the beach hated him, and that he and he alone brought an end to their sandy utopia. Indeed he spends much of his time on the island alone in the woods going a bit loopy. A disappointing release from the director of 'Trainspotting', which is beginning to look more and more like a fluke given that he also made the terrible 'Life Less Ordinary'. Do yourself a favor and watch 'Lord Of The Flies' instead. Piggy's cracked glasses alone are more entertaining than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"Not the best movie he's done, kinda dragged in some parts.

If you took out any 3-minute segment of this film and made a preview out of it, it would look pretty good, but all put together, this movie just sank like an anchor. Save your money and your time. If you want to see Leonardo DiCaprio in a stunning performance, go see \\"What's Eating Gilbert Grape\\" and if you want to see Tilda Swinton, see \\"Orlando.\\" Although their performances are just as good in this film, this movie just isn't worth seeing.

There is no way to explain how bad it was.

It certainly is not a \\"pick me up\\" kind of a film, but there was just something about the idea of this really happening that is very intriguing to me. I like to daydream and what better movie than to watch to stimulate my imagination. The actors and actresses were great. Tilda Swinton was the \\"ringleader\\" if you will, (she also starred as the White Witch in the Chronicles of Narnia) she just has a very believable presence on film that drew me in the movie. Like the White Witch, she had a haunting aura on film. I found it to be like a differnt version of \\"Lord of the Flies\\". There is always evil among people. The movie could have been made a bit better, but over all I would reccommend anyone to give it a shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice movie","review":"After I heard the bad reviews I was surprised by the movie.

If it was the makers idea to show how dull and lifeless hedonism can be then, yes, they succeeded. No humour, no character - how can you enjoy a film when you can't connect with anyone in it? Some have enjoyed the scenery, but the only laugh I got was when Leo and co finally arrive and their eyes widen, they are dumb-struck, the camera tracks back and we see... a beach. Of the title.

But I really didn't like the movie, because it was so not like the book. It had the main area of the plot, but I didn't think the movie had any really suspenseful moments or any great scenes that made the movie better than OK. It could have been really great and even though the actors played their parts well, the movie just seemt thrown together just to release another supposed-to-be-big movie with Leonardo DiCaprio in it. I just expected alot more from such a great book. They made a good \\"Green Mile\\" book to movie. Why wasn't this one better?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty pointless...but the trees looked good!","review":"For the most part, this movie was pretty pointless. The scenery looked very gorgeous, but as for a script...well, there was none! In short, we see three people go to an island that is supposedly hidden from society, and there they find about 50 other people. (Which doesn't make much sense in the first place, because we never really find out how any of the other people got there, since there aren't supposed to be any \\"maps\\" in the outside world.) Anyways, a bunch of non-coherent events happen, including Leonardo DiCaprio going mad. All in all, \\"The Beach\\" is a mess which was not very entertaining.By the way, I read in another review that this movie should not be compared to \\"Lord of the Rings\\". While I think \\"The Beach\\" cannot even compare, the settings and overall subject matter are quite similar."},{"rating":"1","title":"easily the worst movie ever","review":"Obviously, someone came up w/ this great idea and had the capital to hire great actors and pay for great sets... the studio signed off on a huge budget for computer graphics, props and salaries... then they got the screenplay and/or director from the classifieds or something.

Not funny one bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parents: do NOT let your kids see this trash!","review":"This film should have not made it to the theaters, but even still, it should have been rated NC-17. The entire plot revolves around teens traveling by themselves to a foreign country (Thailand) so they can live there forever, smoking natively grown marijuana and have sex non-stop.An EXTREMELY graphic sex scene was totally unnecessary in this film, as was the film itself, which didn't even have a story.

Must have had a boat payment due at the time.Having seen him in \\"This Boy's Life\\" (and no, it's no mistake I laud that film, rather than \\"Titanic\\", I am cognizant of the rare genius he displays when working with a good script.With this piece of tripe, he didn't stand a chance.

Not me, I enjoyed every moment of the film. The plot was the biggest challenge to satisfy the Hollywood audience. However, it's not a surprise that Leo would choose a film with a difficult plot, his previous films have been critically acclaimed but not always praised by the audience. His performance as Richard in this film is quite impressive, probably better than the character he played in Titanic. The deleted scenes is satisfying, with a behind-the-scenes look and the alternate opening sequence."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Unnatural Disaster","review":"First of all, I thought Leonardo DiCaprio was wonderful in \\"Titanic.\\" This is not his fault.

The plot is terrible and after Richard is sent away from the rest as punishment until he can get rid of the newcomers - it only gets worse and confusing.

This seems to be somewhat of a \\"cult\\" movie, in that it deals with the dark sides of people, and how friendships can be broken. I don't like movies such as this, although many of you who see this movie may have a totally different experience than I did.I really liked the scenery. Does anyone know if this movie was actually filmed on location in the Gulf of Thailand?I wanted to share my views with you, even though this movie is not exactly one that I like so much. However, don't let me discourage you from seeing it, necessarily, you might find yourself liking it ;)Take care, as always,--Daniel"},{"rating":"1","title":"should've been called \\"The Cheech\\" instead!","review":"Cheech & Chong were kings of marijuana films. This film set out to more than that and failed miserably. Would have been better to have had Cheech Marin as one of the drug bosses and Chong as the Leonardo's character... then at least it would had the chance to be a comedy instead of the worst drama of the year."},{"rating":"1","title":"the horror, the horror","review":"Near the end, I seriously started to wonder if it was supposed to be a spoof of \\"Apocalypse Now.\\" A pretentiously bad film full of adolescent images and concepts. The acting is not great. Di Caprio's role becomes embarrassing. I suspect he didn't realize just what he'd gotten himself into while they filmed it. As you can see from the other reviews, the premise of Di Caprio's character had potential and a lot of appeal, but the story went completely lame, fast. This film is juvenile fiction that took itself SO seriously. Too bad it wasn't a spoof. Leonardo Di Caprio doing Martin Sheen. That's a pretty funny idea. Yes, it was."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Boring","review":"The concept of this film is great-the movie well,-- IT'S BAD!! The problems with this film are many. First of all, we know NOTHING about the main character Richard or WHY he is in Thailand. Yeah, backpacking but by himself? It would of been interesting to see WHAT made him go there? Then once the three stooges find \\"the beach\\" it just gets way too confusing. How did \\"the community\\" end up there???? And then Richard goes MAD but WHY??? Who would go mad in a beautiful beach like that?? The rest were perfectly fine! I just feel that the characters were too mysterious. In my opinoin it would of been more interesting if only the three of them would find the island on their own instead of using a dumb map left by a crackhead. It would of been more interesting to see more about the Thai culture, after all it was filmed there! It was fast paced, confusing and boring. The only star here are the beaches of Thailand!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie bites","review":"This movie bites. This movie is boring. This movie is stupid.

I've already spent too much time on this imbecilic attempt at a film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Golden Razzie Nominee","review":"The only reason this film will NOT win the Razzie for Worst Film, Worst Actor, and Worst Director is because John Travolta released \\"Battlefield Earth\\" in the same year. This film is without doubt the worst film I have personally seen this year. The book was much better than this (which doesn't say much since I found the book to be derivative and episodic). Director Danny Boyle is capable of much better than this. The one star goes to the Director of Photography for some beautiful scenery."},{"rating":"1","title":"good location, poor story","review":"Here's a movie that got off the ground by the merits of the box-office winning actor and the promise of sexy scenes.

I saw this movie on Satelitte before and that's what made me want to really B-U-Y this movie. I HIGHLY reccomend that you B-U-Y this movie today, if not today then whenever you can!! It's the best!

Lousy movie.","review":"The story is a highly promising. Adventure-prone young man seeks adventure in Thailand, finds it but it all goes pear-shaped on him. He ends up on a paradise island hippie commune made up of other beautiful young people with exotic European accents and simply bulging with street-cred. But there's trouble in paradise as good old human nature, here symbolised by sex, intrigue and corruption rears its ugly head. Sounds great, doesn't it?I'm told the book is a fantastic read. Which may explain why this movie is unforgivably cheesy adaptation, with di Caprio turning in a flat, uninspred performnace. Unsatisfying and disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it","review":"The Beach is a movie full of adventure and pure imagination. It strays from the classic Hollywood romance movie and opens up a controversial theme. We yearn for paradise, but once within our reach, do we start breaking it down, and ultimately destroying everything we touch? Leo's character is so different from the norm you can only be completely fascinated by it. As another person wrote: the critics were unusually harsh on it. It is such a shame that people might choose not to experience it because of this. See it for yourself, go into it with an open mind, and draw your own conclusions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful, beautiful film","review":"I really enjoyed this movie when I saw it in the theater and can't wait to see it again on video.

You're all missing the point. Anyone who has lived in a paradise and seen it infested with tourists you'll understand what the message of this film is about (well that's what it means to me). There is a lot of depth to this film that is hidden under a pretty views and ganja smoke. A dam fine film but the book is a lot better. P.S.

It is a wonderful book and definitely one of the best books of a new generation of younger writers. The movie, however, was disappointing. Many of the best ideas, concepts, and characters from the book were either left out or cheapened by the adaptation to film. However, I felt the locations were fantastic and many of the characters were cast very, very well. My recommendation? Skip the movie and read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless","review":"Really...\\"Earth Ponds A to Z an Illustrated encyclopedia\\" is EXACTLY that,For example: \\"Beaver\\", with a picture and explanation of what a beaver is. \\"Backhoe\\" with a photo of a backhoe and an explanation of what one is.

It goes in the Goodwill pile."},{"rating":"2","title":"For those afraid of dying with unlived lives in their viens","review":"A movie of quiet desperation, of a good woman who makes bad choices. She is a woman who gets a glint of hope, after she had forgotten what her dreams were, or how to dream at all. Who wouldn't clutch at it? I almost felt afraid during this movie because I saw so much of myself, and so much I don't want to become.For those who rated this movie poorly, perhaps Crossroads with Britney Spears is more on your intellectual level."},{"rating":"1","title":"the big yawn","review":"I can see that others raved about this movie, but I found it hard to sit through. I am not criticizing the performances, but my question is: what is the point of this movie? Whose fault IS it that Justine's life is so dull? I can't see how it's anybody's fault but hers. I kept wanting her to DO something: go to school, take classes, become a carpenter, a chef, a real estate agent, a gardener, an artist, ANYTHING. She seems just empty. She's bored with her husband because he smokes pot and watches inane TV, but she isn't any better. Hard to feel sympathetic. And the movie was just as boring. At one point I thought it would turn into a real black comedy, but it retreated to just dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"Jennifer Anniston is one of my favorite actresses. Her portrayal of Justine, a retail clerk, bored with her job, husband, and pretty much every aspect of her life, was typical big screen Anniston, lots of eye movement, not much dialogue, same performance as Rock Star...I thought the movie was also predictable. She has an affair, up until that time was unable to get pregnant, takes a home pregnancy test, comes up pregnant, husband is elated when only prior was tested at the fertility clinic. Surprise, surprise, he gets the phone call saying he cannot have children while surrounded by friendly well-wishers who are now speechless as Anniston looks on...There were no earth-shattering moments, tepid to say the least and I found myself watching the clock waiting for it be over..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Girl....Bad Movie","review":"Saw this recently at the theater with three friends, and we walked out with not much to say about it. It wasn't awful, but it was fairly unremarkable. Seemed more like a Lifetime movie than a theatrical release. Credit to Aniston for taking part in an \\"indie\\" film, but it is fairly boring fare from start to finish. I think this was marketed as a comedy, but it wasn't very funny. It wasn't very dramatic. It just \\"was\\". And the ending was kind of disappointing, in that the character is more or less in the same depressing situation as she is at the beginning of the film. This was not a movie I chose to see on my own...I kind of got dragged into it by a date, so keep that in mind when reading my review. \\"Notorious CHO\\" was playing in the adjacent theater, and I was really wishing we were there instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible DVD Transfer - Good Film","review":"Watched the DVD last night and on my calibrated 50\\" HDTV this was one of the the worst looking DVDs I've ever seen. Most scenes were soft and flat, but the dark indoor scenes were the worst. Black areas glowed blue and all detail was lost/washed out. Really a shame since it's a interesting film with several fine performances. I've checked with several others...and all share my experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Story","review":"I wasn't expecting much when I went to go see The Good Girl. But Jennifer Aniston really surprised me with her outstanding performance. This film shows she is a very versitile actresses. I really felt for her character as she was making important decisions about her life. Also, the story is guaranteed to make you think. It seems many of the characters want more out of their life, but don't know how to get it living in this small town. All in all, this movie really held my interest"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissonant combination of drama and \\"humor\\"","review":"Something just isn't right about this film; I think it's the dissonant way the film combines lightness and humor with drama and tragedy. The film seems to expect us to take the characters and the story seriously at the same time it does not."},{"rating":"1","title":"fell asleep.....","review":"....and i've only fell asleep in two movies in my whole 19 years of life.nuff said......"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Star for Zooey Deschanel.","review":"This is a movie that starts out nowhere, and for 95 minutes takes you further than any nowhere you ever dreamed of. Unimaginative, lacking in humor, and a senseless plot, The Good Girl is definitely a movie for anyone who loves other bad, nonsensical current movies like Crash. Jennifer Aniston plays a new version of Rachel, and the writing is just awful. The only good thing about this movie is Zooey Deschanel, but then, Zooey can sparkle like a diamond in any old trash heep."},{"rating":"1","title":"really...really bad","review":"I was expecting a lot more from this movie. It has no happy ending at all and you end up hating each and every single one of the characters. It's about a 30 year old woman working at a dead end job with a loser, pot smoking, husband who doesn't treat her right and she falls in love with the guy at work. She ends up pregnant and instead of telling her pot smoking husband that it's over she lets him believe he is the father of the baby. Why in the world would she want him to raise her child? She found her true love with the guy at work who worships the ground she walks on. When she dumps him he ends up dead and she couldn't care less. She continues to work at the job she hates, stays married to the drug addicted husband and raises the dead guy's baby with him. That's the ending. What the...?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I think Jennifer Aniston is a great actress but this movie doesn't do her justice.

By the end, I didn't even care what happened to the characters.

What's all the buzz really about? That Jennifer Aniston can play something other than her \\"Friends\\" role? Cmon! Aniston plays Justine, a depressed check out girl at a small town retail store who longs for something more. She meets Holden, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, a much younger, new employee and has an affair with him. The skinny: he falls in love, becomes obsessed, gets her pregnant, robs the retail store and then......I won't blow the ending. Did I mention she was married to John C Reilly? Anyway, she tells him the baby is his and they live happily ever after in Normalsville. The story drags, though there is a very suspenseful pivotal moment for her (at a stoplight), but overall the film falls flat. Good Girl is nothing to run out to so save your pennies for the DVD rental. **1/2"},{"rating":"2","title":"There really are dumb people.","review":"I can find criticisms, but if just looking at the film as a vehicle for Jennifer Aniston, it did show a depth to her acting ability.The whole plot seemed dumb, but I'll go along with the thought that there really are some pretty dumb people, and this is how this collection would live out such slice of life situations.There are real people on the Jerry Springer show, and this film seems to actually capture the mentality of such people. Not the greatest subject material, but who hasn't watched some snippets of Jerry Springer and been entertained?"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The Good Girl\\" lacks integrity","review":"I am sorry to say that I was very disappointed in this movie. Although Jennifer Aniston does a great job of stepping out of her \\"Friends\\" image, she should have done it in a movie with more integrity. A film that should have been about love, loyalty, and desire for something more than the odinary, turned into one completely about sex. With so much potential and honest acting, it is a shame that \\"The Good Girl\\" turned out the way it did. I wish I could recommend this movie, but the crudeness of it outweighs all of its positive aspects.So much sex and drug content is a sign of a weak director, who must rely on sexual content instead of the beauty of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, stupid, boring","review":"This movie made me thinking about how needy Jennifer Aniston and others in this movie should be to participate in something like this.

I love Jennifer Anniston and while she did a great job acting in the movie, I was really let down. This movie had the worst storyline I have ever come across! I truly have no clue as to how this movie got into theatres. Sure it had a few comical parts (especially the lady who gave make-overs, plus a pretty good cast). But I could've wrote this movie myself, I guessed what would happen within the first 20 minutes of this ridiculous time wasting movie, almost in a jokingly way and everything I predicted was right.

Each time she does something to cover up the affair, she creates a bigger and bigger mess. Each time she tries to get out of the affair, it gets a little worse and a little harder to do. The emotions run high, and the characters are ridiculously simple-minded. Though the concept for this movie was good, it was quite unintelligent and weak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't do it for me.","review":"All I heard when this film hit the theatre was how good Aniston's performance was. After viewing this movie, I feel like the odd woman out. Really how hard is it to act depressed? And that accent-Lord help. Gyllenhaal, as always, is astounding. He and his sister are definitely talented and are rising stars. John C. Reilly the underappreciated talent is also good. Aniston-needs to go back to tv with her other friends and stop masquerading as a movie star. I suspect now that Mr. Pitt is gone that will be where she'll get future work. The film isn't a total bust, there are some thought-provoking questions posed but the plot was entirely too transparent. I knew what was going to happen to Holden back when he first started giving her books to read. Overall: It's just not my cup of tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"good actress-bad movie","review":"I am sure this movie was meant to be deep on some level, but it was horrible, I regret buying it. I think Jennifer Aniston is a phenomenal actress, but even she couldn't help this movie.It was way too slow, the main actress brought all of her problems on to herself, which is never addressed. And she walks away scott-free. Completely predictable, you wind up shaking your head the whole time in disbelief/disgust. Plus it is utterly anticlimatic, it is slow through the whole movie!She never even tries to talk to her \\"ho-hum\\" husband in the movie, just goes and messes around, with someone else who wasnt all that great either. I would rather use this DVD as a drink coaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"The other one-star reviewers have pretty well covered this movie, but I will say there were a few amusing scenes (not nearly enough in that hour and a half of wasted time). When a character commits adultery, deserts a friend during an emergency, tries to get rid of a mentally unstable lover by feeding him (she thinks) contaminated grapes, lies to her husband that he's the father of her baby, lies about whom she had an affair with, causing that man to be beaten up, and goes on about her life with the same expression throughout, with no change or growth in herself, her story is shallow, and the movie is pointless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete waste of time!","review":"The Good Girl is a Horror of a film. It imagines itself as an ode to the everyman, trapped in a humdrum existence. What it becomes on film is an insulting example of Hollywood filmmaking at its worst. I use the word insulting because that is what I felt as I watched this movie. Aniston, Nelson, Gyllenhaal, all are trying so hard to be average that they seem on the verge of a \\"Forrest Gump\\" imitation. Gyllenhaal and Aniston in particular seem to be doing a caricature of working folk. The way they slump around and furrow their brows as they trudge thru the tired dialog, it's as though each is fighting to understand what the other is saying.The film itself is grey and dull. The other characters in the film flat and stereotypical (i.e. the coworker who invites her to bible study).Overall this movie isn't worth the time or effort it took to transfer it to DVD. In another era it probably would have never made it to the screen. Oh how I miss that era....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drying Paint","review":"This is one of the worst movies I have seen in some time. Aniston does not succeed in portraying anyone but herself - she talks the same, shuffles her feet, hangs her head all in an attempt to give the image of boredom and dissatisfaction which is exactly what the viewer will get with this performance and movie. I suggest watching paint dry for better entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who cares?","review":"Nothing about any of the characters in this film made me care what happened to any of them or why. Aniston is as flat and two-dimensional as she is in Friends, and her \\"Texas\\" accent was halfhearted at best. The only worthwhile acting job in this boring hour and a half was done by the actor who played Bubba to comic perfection, even though the character's justifications for his actions were a stretch. I sat it out, waiting and waiting for something in this film that lived up to the positive reviews, but came up with nothing. It was nothing about nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad!","review":"this is a depressing movie. if u wanna be depressed, go for it! jennifer anniston is wayyyyyy too good for this film.!!... i wanted to slit my wrists when i was done watching this. it was bad and i dont know how, but as the movie went on, it got worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was very excited to go see this movie, and extremely disappointed with what I saw. The story tells of a girl (Jennifer Aniston) who hates her life and wants freedom from the bonds of matrimony that tie her to her pathetic, pot-head husband. Throughout the entire film you're stuck thinking how dense this character must be, because she never actually does anything to help her situation. At the finish of the film, I found myself sitting in my seat wondering \\"Is that it?\\" I can't believe I wasted ...on the price of admission.Why did I even bother to give the film one star? Despite the flimsy plot, Jennifer Aniston did give a fairly good performance given the script she was working with."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Good Girl-What a flop!","review":"I heard this movie described as \\"one of the best movies of the year!\\" Well, it was by far the worst movie I have EVER seen.

I tried, really, to like this movie, but it is one movie that I truly despise. The story line in itself is unoriginal and also stupid. A woman is having a really bad life, so she starts trying to fix it, no big deal, maybe even intersting. But then her way of \\"fixing\\" it is to be in an affair with a strange pyscotic younger man. Not exactly what I think would qualify as fixing. This movie did not hold my attention and to this day I am sorry for the time that I will never get back that was spent watching that movie.On the plus side, the acting from Jennifer Aniston and Jake Gyllenhaal is very well done. That is the only plus side for the entire movie. Do yourself a favor and watch something you won't regret later, \\"Office Space\\" or \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" if you're stuck on the actors, perhaps. Both of those movies are signicantly better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, nothing exceptional!","review":"Aniston is just about OK, but manages to leave an impression of sorts! However the downside was that she kind of brought the \\"Friends\\" method of acting in this movie too!

Must be why she and that other no-brainer Brad Pitt get along so well!Jennifer Aniston What an idiot!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected","review":"I was pretty sure that this was going to be your typical chick flick and was expecting to nap about half-way through it. However, I was surprised to find that it wasn't anything like I thought it would be.It's not a bubbly romantic comedy. It's quite dark and in a lot of ways reminded me of Donnie Darko (which could only be due to Jake Gyllenhaal starring in both as a mentally ill young man).The pace was perfect. The events unfolded neither too fast or too slow. I didn't find myself getting bored or wondering why all of the action was taking place so soon.It's not for everyone though. If you're looking for your typical Jennifer Aniston flick, skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"very very good","review":"The movie is far better than one might expect. Aniston and especially Gyllenhaal give super performances. Aniston is perfect as a dissatisfied wife, bright but not wise, who takes advantage of a confused teenager to get the sex and attention that is lacking in her marriage. When she finds out that he is immature (to say the least) and emotionally unstable, she decides to dump him. Given the choice between sacrificing herself for a disturbed kid who is hopelessly in love with her, and destroying him she chooses to destroy him (literally since her abandonment causes his suicide). It is hardly a comedy but rather unsettlingly dark and human and tragic. Gyllenhaal has a brilliant moment when he is in the car beside her cracking up emotionally. A bravura performance for him."},{"rating":"2","title":"The horror of inertia","review":"30-year-old Justine is drowning in inertia. Her dead-end job at \\"the Retail Rodeo\\" and her stoner husband make up her humdrum existence, and it's slowly driving her crazy. So when surly 22-year-old Holden (who renamed himself after the main character from \\"Catcher in the Rye\\") becomes Justine's new co-worker, she sees an opportunity to bond with a kindred spirit. \\"You hate the world,\\" she tells him. \\"I hate it, too.\\" The two embark on a passionate affair, but quickly Justine finds herself in over her head.\\"The Good Girl\\" is a terrific drama about a woman at a crossroads in her life. Justine hates the predictability of her uninspired life, but she's also terrified to take a leap into the unknown. I think there are very few people who can't relate to her situation. Jennifer Aniston is remarkable in the role of Justine, shedding all the obvious charm and cuteness of her \\"Friends\\" persona to inhabit a character that is heartbreakingly ordinary."},{"rating":"1","title":"A different review","review":"I bought this dvd after reading all the reviews on this site and on other sites saying that this is such a great movie. i watched this movie and thought it was one of the worst movies i had seen and could not believe that i had wasted so much money on it and so many people gave it such a good review. It was meant to be a comedy and i could not see anything that was close to commical in this movie. The most funny thing about this movie is how crap it was."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real sleeper!!!!","review":"This movie has to be one of the worst I have purchased. The laughs are minimal and the movie just drags. If you want something real laid back to put you to sleep, here is your movie. Very dissapointing!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I can't believe Jennifer Aniston was in this movie. I have really enjoyed all of her previous movies. I guess she was trying to break the good girl persona. It was awful. After watching, I thought to myself, why??? I could have done so much more with my 2 hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your time","review":"Save your time, save your money. This movie is horrible. I got this for my wife, thinking it was a movie she would enjoy more than me, but she didn't like it one bit either. Although the movie was only 90+ minutes, it seemed like 2.5 hours. Where is the Zero star rating, one star is too high."},{"rating":"1","title":"A MUSN'T See","review":"I can't believe Jennifer Aniston agreed to be in this movie - it was far from a comedy as the back of the DVD states. I guess \\"Good Girl\\" is a sarcastic title - and not only saying that it is far fetched that someone like her would be married into the lifestyle portrayed in the movie - but how could she really think of starting a life with Holden and not see that he is a complete wack job who has become obsessed with her.I really must admit that her acting was very good - but the movie was just terrible. It was simply unrealistic with her making ridiculous decisions - either she was desperate for money - desperate to be in a film - or just so out of touch with how \\"little people\\" live that she couldn't see that the movie was a bad choice. Just watch Friends and leave this one alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't like this at all","review":"I didn't like 'the good girl' - it should have been titled, 'i use people for my own good.' Justine makes Tom/Holden think she's in love with him and wants to be with him and then suddenly decides she wants to go back to her husband. She knew up front Holden was disturbed and only pushed him over the edge anyway. She won in the end with the baby and her husband's forgiveness.I only like some of the references and/or similarities to \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" and the movie felt a lot like the Cohen brothers film (which I love), but overall I was disappointed with it. Glad it was on TV for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The Best Movie Of The Year\\" Gone Wrong","review":"I bought this movie expecting to have a great time watching it. The reviews plastered on the front cover rave about it, so I expected a great film. What I got was the complete opposite. This movie appalled me. The fact that it was called \\"The Best Movie Of The Year\\" just goes to show that some of the movie critics have no idea what they are talking about. The accents were insulting and the plot line took unnecessary turns that were, at their best, grotesque. I would not recommend this movie to anyone and if, for some twisted reason, you're looking for a copy of it on DVD, you can have mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is AWFUL!","review":"I watched this movie with 3 other adults, and none of us liked it. We wanted to turn it off after the first 15 minutes, but decided to give it a fair chance. It wasn't worth it! All of us like different kinds of movies, but we could barely keep our eyes open. It wasn't funny, it didn't pull at your heartstrings, but it does make your mind go numb. Plot? What is that? Maybe I'll send this movie to my worst enemy so THEY can be tortured. I usually like Jennifer Aniston, but this script was terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I rented this movie expecting a GOOD movie. I guess the acting was ok and everything, after all, it did raise emotions in me that I haven't felt towards a movie in a long time: Anger. It wasn't the actors fault I don't think. The movie flat out could have been better written. Instead I wound up so angry at just about every turn this movie took, and really disliking pretty much every character in this movie. The thing with Bubba was totally unnecessary and I think was the point I went from thinking this movie might make a possible recovery to just being a waste of my time and those people's talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your typical 'Friends' vehicle","review":"Jennifer Aniston's movie career hasn't amounted to a hill of beans, mostly due to her inability to pick good roles. Here though, whether through the luck of a blind squirrel finding an acorn now and then or better career management, she's honed in on a great anti-'Friends' tonic with Mike White's finely-tuned script. [White also appears as Aniston's bible study-going buddy.]The best thing to say about 'The Good Girl' is that it won't appeal to fans of Aniston's 'Rachel' persona. That's a 'go' signal for all of us fans of smaller, Independent Spirit-sized releases who would otherwise tend to lump an Aniston-led film into the category of \\"Friends vehicle. Won't see.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"You probably have better ways to spend two hours.","review":"A lurking cynicism behind the portrayals of these characters, trapped as they are by their droll and inane lives, almost manifests itself here as comedy. The dubious choices these unsypathetic characters make in their lives result in very little emotional engagement for the audience. Mainly, I was wondering how this movie was made in the first place and why otherwise talented people would dedicate their time to completing it. There are only two good points (one for each star): 1) Aniston shows more of an acting range than expected in her portrayal, and 2) the characters and their situations are all but guaranteed to make everyone else feel better about their own lives, by comparison. I would only recommend this to a friend going through a serious funk in order to show them that as bad as their job, marriage, abuse problems, affairs, etc. might be..."},{"rating":"1","title":"depressing, boring and waste of good cast!","review":"THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST DEPRESSING MOVIES I'VE SEEN LATELY.

DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR YOUR TIME!!!!!THE WRITING/ SCRIPT SHOULD HAVE BEEN FILED IN THE ROUND FILE IN THE BEGINNING!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You either get it....or you don't","review":"The Good Girl speaks to those people who have at one time felt trapped in their lives and couldnt get out. If you have never felt like you were stuck in silent desperation in a stagnant pond,if you have ever felt that adding a little chaos in your life is better than boredom, then you will probably never understand the point of this movie.There are no Oscar winning performances here in this simple story...but all the characters do an excellent job of pretending to move forward with their lives, but actually go nowhere.The story is simple, a bored cashier strikes up an affair with a very young and troubled co-worker.Don't expect much but the underlying point of the film speaks volumes about desperation in a small town."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can Jennifer Aniston really act? Not in this movie, anyway.","review":"The beginning of this film gives you hope that it might turn out interesting and thought-provoking. However, it loses ground about half-way through. Jennifer Aniston proves once again that she is not a serious actress. She fails to engage us in her character, Justine. Even John C. Reilly (usually a very good character actor), who plays Justine's stoner husband, falls flat as he has little to work with. Jake Gyllenhal is alright as Holden, but they take that character too far out. The plot is thin and the filmaker leaves us with unanswered questions that seem rather pointless. The most entertaining parts of this film I found to be the dead-panned announcements over the PA in the discount store where Justine works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dullest Movie Ever","review":"I am a huge Jennifer Aniston fan, however I have seen her in better scripts. Her performance was good for what the film was. I personally did not enjoy the story line. Normally I watch a film to escape and feel good, as you do with a good book. But, this movie bored and depressed me. Anytime someone dies in the end it makes you wonder what was the point of spending two hours of my life to watch a film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comedy?","review":"I was disappointed in the movie. It was billed \\"A Comedy of Winning Delicacy and Heart\\". There was nothing comical about it. I expected something more like Picture Perfect with Jennifer Aniston...that is a comedy.

I watched it to the end but am sorry that I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"the good girl","review":"the good girl is a good movie to watch if you have absolutely nothing else to do.That would also include root canal work.it should have been titled the adultress bored wife.aniston may be in a good movie someday but this isnt it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlikeable Characters","review":"Jennifer Aniston certainly proves she can act in this film, playing the Anti-Rachel. Unfortunately, I found it difficult to like her character, or most of the others. She plays a selfish and amoral woman, who seems to care nothing about the feelings or well-being of others. Other unlikeable characters included her illicit lover, \\"Holden\\", a self-absorbed, whiney twit, who idolizes Salinger, but is himself a rather talentless writer, and Bubba, her husband's sleazy and opportunistic friend. In fact, the only character in the film who comes off at all sympathetic is her dim-witted but well-meaning husband, who seems to actually care about her for some reason. She should have gotten her husband into drug-treatment, and herself into night classes. Instead, she continues to lie to him right up to the end, apparently having learned nothing from her experience. Neither does the audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rather watch grass grow than to see this movie again.","review":"There's 94 minutes of my life I'm never going to get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self Pity Is A Waste Of Time","review":"What a waste of talent...Why is Hollywood so in love with losers?...The acting is top rate which makes this a very well constructed Outhouse!Outside of the talent, this story has one redeeming virtue, it shows the destructive effect Catcher In The Rye has had on our culture...Holden Caulfied is living in a free society, equipped with a healthy body and access to more education and advantages than can be dreamed of in 80% of the world..but the little spoiled brat is unhappy because the world is not perfect....and those who are addicted to Salinger's work are infected with this cowardly approach to life...What a waste of an hour and a half...There ARE happy, contributing, courageous human beings in the world and their stories are truly interesting...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Gift","review":"Very nice dvd, this was purchased for sisters birthday gift and she was very pleased, arrived quickly and she watches it constantly she really enjoys the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful Information","review":"There is a lot of useful information in this book.

It's about time for more earnest music, people who seem to take their craft, and their emotions, seriously. Ms. Martin does just that.

Veggie was does help ease the mind a little knowing that you can wash off the chemicals and wax that sits on the outside. It is not a magic product so don't think you can just spray and rinse. I usually spray my fruit or veggies and rub it for about 20-30 seconds and then rinse it off.

It will only go to a computer and from there you can load it normally to your Ipod.

There is way too much fluff in the lines (too much bantering about nothing), and I preferred the film to concentrate more on the works of Henri Matisse. Yet there are way way too many paintings missing from the film that weren't covered because of the fluffiness in the conversation between the cartoon characters of Matisse and the penguin. The best part of the film is the analysis of the few paintings by Matisse, but like I wrote...way too few of them covered. Another worst part of the film is how little of Matisse's history is covered. All in all, I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Good As The Dropping In On Picasso or Rousseau","review":"Compared to other DVDs in the series, the animation in this is horrible, really amateur. At least SOME effort had gone into \\"Dropping in on Picasso\\" and \\"Dropping in on Rousseau\\" which felt much more like real real cartoons with characters and jokes, but this was a totally different with a much cheaper style of animation, and the transfer was crummy too. Whereas I had shown 15 minutes of the other DVDs in this series, I skipped ahead to the last five minutes of this one, just to show the \\"drawing with scissors\\" part, which was only a bit better than me showing the artwork and talking about it.

However, as incredible as she was live, her CD is even better. I happened to pick up a copy at one of the shows and boy am I glad I did. It's very fluid all the way through with a relaxed yet upbeat sound. Her guitar playing is very smooth and her voice is soothing and soulful. The song writing on this CD is excellent.

IT IS AWESOME. Very comfy interior, stylish detachable visor. I feel like the T2000 riding down the street with this and my sunglasses on. I have yet to test its impact capabilities (and I hope I never will). It does have the DOT sticker on it, so I am trusting they did their job. I would recommend this to anyone shopping for a moped or scooter helmet. I'm also going to hook myself up with some old-school aviator goggles to complete the look."},{"rating":"2","title":"NICE HELMET","review":"If a half-helmet is what you want, this is a nice product. Looks great, fits comfortably. The visor snaps off so you can install a third-party half-face shield if you want to protect the eyes from flying bugs. A half helmet give you the feeling of unobstructed vision but, of course, provides no protection from injury to your face. All things considered, I like it and I'm keeping it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good value","review":"This is a good helmet, nothing negative to say...comfortable, and the zip out feature is nice.

I would purchase it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Helmet but be cautious about the size","review":"I bought this helmet on Amazon. I used the sizing information on the company web site, and that said I should order a medium. So I ordered a medium using the pull down menu on Amazon. The product description says Large, but I assumed that you could order other sizes since that option is given. I was sent a large, which turned out to fit just fine, so I lucked out. I've never had a half helmet before, and it feels snug, which it should for crash protection.I like the helmet, it's comfortable and looks good. I can't use the visor since it won't fit in my under seat storage bin (the whole reason I bought a half helmet). The 4 stars is for the product itself. The sizing information is confusing at best. Raider should fix the listing to accurately reflect what they are selling. My guess is that they ship you a large no matter what the pull down says."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT a 3/4 Helmet","review":"This is a modified 1/2 helmet, but still a great helmet at the price. The visor is a little loose and moves around a bit, but nothing too annoying. Fits well, is sturdy, and not all that uncomfortable (not THAT comfortable either). Great buy for the price, shipped ahead of time. Would buy from vendor again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"Shipping was prompt, and the helmet is very satisfactory. Fits well, not too heavy and reasonably comfortable. Also looks good, and I like the ability to snap off the sun visor and snap on a full face shield if necessary.

The XL was just a bit too loose and I have a pretty good sized noggin. So if you are like me and prefere your helmet a little more snug than loose, order one size smaller than you normally would and you should have a perfect fit. Other than that, love the fit, the look and the feel; an all around comfortable helmet. I would recomend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great. Look. Fantastic price","review":"Great. Look.

Being a half helmet, it has pads for the ears, which are very convenient for long rides or cold rides.Only two CONS:1- it makes you look supersized.

I do wonder about the DOT rating though, looks like a cheezy sticker put on as an advertizement"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Helmet for the Money","review":"If youre looking for a decent, DOT-approved helmet for not a lot of money, then this is it. Its nothing too fancy. It does come with a zip-out neck protector which is nice. The neck protector seems to have a spot for a bike's communication set. The only real problem with the helmet is that it sits really high on your head, so you look kinda funny when you put it on. I guess its a small price to pay for protecting your noggin though.All in all, for the money, you can't beat it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned it....","review":"I Didn't like the way it looked.

It is not very well made, it runs small and the shell feels like it would crack if you dropped it. Didn't give me a whole lot of confidence that it would protect someones head in an accident. But considering the price, I guess you really can't expect to much.I would only recommend you use this helmet if you are riding a scooter or moped that doesn't get up to highway speeds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Larger than expected.","review":"I did not wear this item for actual riding. It was much larger than anticipated, not as in larger head size, but it was \\"taller.\\" As far as function, from what I observed, it should work well, and included fully covered ear-flaps for the chin strap, which I found to be a nice feature.

The text tells about things that the mother and baby elephant do together. Although these activities (like playing with lemurs) aren't things that most children have experienced, many readers will be able to relate to the warmth of the parent/child relationship. The specificity the author uses in description of the elephants' activities makes the story more interesting.There isn't much of a plot to this book, but I don't know how much plot a person can expect of a board book.

They forget to put the book in the context in which it was written. The classics are great historical pieces, regardless of today's relivance. For example, the movie \\"Birth of a Nation\\" is considered today to be one of the most racist and biting movies of all time. It was made around 1910. It is still interesting to view it and see what was going on in the minds of the people who produced it. The same goes for Decline of the West."},{"rating":"2","title":"Abridged, but worthwhile.","review":"Most of the negative comments concerning this most remarkable book are directed at the abridgement, not the book itself. I found nothing in the abridgement offensive or distorting. The introduction is terrible and does, in fact, betray a deep misunderstanding of Spengler. But I was able to read the abridgement with pleasure (in a day, too) and then go out and buy the two-volume hardcover edition later on. Now nearly ten years later I still find Spengler the most insightful historian that has ever written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest book of the 20th century","review":"Quite simply the most important book of the twentieth century for several reasons:1] Spengler offers a morphology of history as an organic conception that can used to understand all historical development with genuine insight.2] Spengler's projection of coming trends (e.g. Militant Islam, environmental crisis, secularization of the elites, \\"second religiousness\\" of the folk, etc.) has enormous predictive value. His understanding of current events (from the perspective of 1917!) is more acute and useful than any present day commentator.3] Without a doubt, Spengler is the most important National Bolshevik thinker.4] \\"Oswald Spengler is the greatest mystic of the twentieth century.\\" - Klemmens von Klemperer"},{"rating":"2","title":"History, and the Future, are not Linear","review":"Spengler is extremely erudite. He is convincing, as far as this reader can understand him, that the West is not on a linear progression of constant improvement---with only a few bumps in the road. Eventually, the West will decline. (In the 1930s, long after publication of \\"Decline\\" he belittled the idea of a Thousand-Year Reich as beyond the capability of any group of humans.

Succintly states the religious significance of the holiday. Would be nice to have a little more detail on that, but it summarizes neatly. Illustrations are pleasing. Some of the wording seems to tend the text more to a girl than a boy (ie. wearing a new Easter \\"dress\\"), but the pictures show both boys and girls (and changing those particular few words during read-aloud will not interfere with the rhyming). Also mentions an Easter parade and choir, which may not be common to all celebrations. On the whole, quite happy to have found this book.

I thought this would be really good because it stars Cameron Diaz and Jennifer Aniston, both of whom I really like. I was wrong. This movie is worse than a really bad soap opera. Both of these actresses have appeared in some abysmal movies, but this one takes the cake. There is rock bottom, but in this case you have rock bottom, 50 feet of crap, and then 'She's the One'!

It is well-written and more engaging than I expected. I did not, however, find it useful for learning actual tax law for my income class tax. It reads more as a free-flowing discourse about tax law than as a treatise or concise explanation of important topics. The organization seems to be based on rhetorical preference rather than any kind of logical order, so I found myself scrutinizing the index for everything.So I guess I can recommend this book if you are deeply interested in the how and the why of tax law.

I would encourage anyone interested in this genre of theatre or even anyone who just enjoys reading something that will really make you think to read these plays. Personally I found Each Day Dies With Sleep slightly disturbing but I believe that's part of the idea and I could definitely see where people would find Marisol to be quite disturbing as well, but if you keep an open mind and try to figure out what Rivera was getting at these plays are fun to read.

The problem with this band was, they released their debut in 1992, when all things melodic rock was disintegrating.Unfairly lumped in with the late 80s' hair metal scene, KOTG didn't really seem to fit that mold. These guys sounded more like Badlands, Tangier and War Babies, but like alot of other forgotten bands, they just became another face in the crowd. Favorite songs from the record are \\"Whatever It takes\\", \\"Take This Old Heart\\", \\"Infactuation\\" and \\"Easy Does It\\".I recommend this album to fans of the melodic rock sounds of the late 80's/early 90's.

If you like those kinds of books don't read on. But if you don't then do read on. This book is just that way because if uses bad words weird sentence's and a bad plot.The characters in this story are Carmelia, the Quagmeirs and the Baudelairs. The worst character is Carmelia because she's mean and cocky. She is like that because she makes fun of kids and she throws stuff at them. The Quagmeirs on the other hand are nice and smart.In conclusion, I don't really like this book because it is boring and confusing. Though other people might think its exciting but I think its boring.

I realize these books are printed for the (children's) story rather than the artwork (unlike Gorey's books), but I believe the author tries to appeal to adult collectors as well as to young readers. As an adult hoping for an amusing and tame but macabre read, I was disappointed in his series. The author enjoys his own sense of humor very much; I can't say the same for the reader. My question is, how many times will he keep rehashing the same plot, with the same unfunny villain? Even the kids are going to catch on and grow tired of the same mediocre story appearing over and over. This is not an author who crosses over into the world of adult reading, much as he tries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop reading this series now!","review":"That's it!

When will the future happen? Is the author going to write these inane and improbable stories forever without any end in sight? In what year (real time) will Violet become of age? I don't know. If the author would let us know when these unfortunate events are going to end, then maybe my students and I will hang in there.

You might want to listen to me , for no matter how harsh I sound I'm just trying to help.Thank you for your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent writer for kids and adults","review":"The author writes in a formulaic style similar to that of Arthur Conan Doyle. All the books follow a similar pattern, but each is interesting and unique. He plays with words in interesting ways, expanding the child reader's vocabulary without them even realizing that they are being taught. But most important in the books, is the message of perseverance through diversity, the love of family, and the importance of true friendship. In a world that portrays the mythical exsistance of an easy world, the author helps to balance that perspective by providing a different view. It also shows how important and dependent the children are on one another, each using his or his special talents to benefit the group as a whole. I recommend these whole series of books for adults and children."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Snicket Book Yet!","review":"In this story I felt like I was really in the book.I am on book 7 and I think this is the best one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Academy","review":"The Baudelaire's are back but are attending to a boarding school,which they get a room with hay and crabs all over the floor or should i say hay.

My favorite part of this story was when Violet, Klaus, and Sunny had to study for their exams, and Sunny had to make staples.I liked this part because I thought it was cool when they all had to get ready, and the method they used was really cool too. I would give this book 5 stars and once you start reading it, you'll want to keep on going."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought this was really good, i liked the suspense.","review":"Coming from a 17 year old,I thought this book was really good. It was suspenseful with a little change in plot because the Baudelaires didn't try to expose Count Olaf right away. They also get friends which I thought was good, and added to the suspense by the end of the book. I was reading one review, and it stated that more than one person could be writing these books, and not just one person with a pen name. I think that is an interesting theory because books 1-3 have the exact same plot, but the plot begins to change in book 4, and continues to change in book 5, so maybe there is more than one writer.

Not only do the Baudelaires have to run S.O.R.E but they also have to listen to a six hour bad violin recital played by their vice principal. Vice principal Nero is a very childish man who is always mimicking the Baudelaires. Then there is also the extra hard final exams and a sectratary test.This middle school story has many twists, and a few surprises. One twist in the story are the lunch ladies true identity.

Their new gardian is Vice Princable Nero, the schools Vice Princable. There is a real nasty girl named Carmeltia Splats that is always mean to the orphans.

It would probably be very hard to understand this book if you hadn't read any of the others. Besides, they're all really good and teach younger kids new vocabulary (like austere!).And, as probably expected, Count Olaf has yet again mastered the art of disguise. It just always disappoints me that the Baudelaires know IMMEDIATELY who the villian is, which is not fair. Well, that's what I have to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great one!","review":"I just love these books. I'm proud to say that I am adult and these books just bring out the kid in me. I laugh out loud when I read them and my husband thinks I'm crazy-but when I read the passage to him, he gets it. I think my favorite thing about these books is the way Lemony Snicket defines words. He doesn't literally define the word, he puts a twist on it and applies it to the situation. I'm a little behind in the series, but I have the other books and will be finishing them up before the latest one is published.

It's hard to chose just one book, but I think this is my favourite. If only because it featured my new heroine, Sunny Baudelaire, working as a secretary, a concept I found oddly hilarious. Like the rest of this glorious series, The Austere Academy is very funny, very nasty, and, in its portrayal of the warm relationship between the unfortunate orphans, strangely heartwarming. Minka!, as Sunny might say. Or rather, shriek."},{"rating":"2","title":"Austere is Awesome!","review":"I loved this book! It took a while for the Unfortunate Events books to truly grow on me but with Book #5 I am thoroughly having a fun time. The story and pace are quick as the Beaudelaire orphans find themselves at the prep school from hell. Count Olaf has some fun and inspired moments. And most importantly Mr. Snicket's writing is sharper than ever.As I am reading the series in order (who wouldn't) I have no clue where things will go but The Austere Academy is the first of the books to do two very important things. One it leaves things hanging perilously on a semi-cliffhanger. Two it's the first book to provide some solid comments connecting Mr. Snicket to Count Olaf (a touch that I especially enjoyed).As a whole the series was enjoyable and the writing unique. I was somewhat disappointed with the 4th book (The Miserable Mill) but with Book The Fifth the author and series are more than back on track, they're solidly in the entertainment lane of good reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Four Stars","review":"This is the fifth book of a new series about the unfortunate kids that go to this private shcool for safty but what they don't know is that there new gym teacher just might be the person there trying to get away from.Read tis book by Lemony Snicket about Violet,Klause,and Sunny and how unfortunate there lives are.I thought this book was creative,suspenseful,and thrilling.The whole series is great.I would recommend tihs book to anyone who likes sad stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious Edition to series","review":"The Austere Academy was a great edition to A Series of Unfortuate Events and it will go down as one of the best in the series.

Although I haven't seen these other places, Kaplan makes me feel like I'm there with him on long bus and train rides observing the people, faces and customs. I enjoyed his historical precis of the situations in every country he travels in. Of course his account is biased because he bases his observations on \\"expert\\" opinions from different countries, many of whom have their own agendas. My only criticism is that sometimes Kaplan has the tendency to overgeneralize or oversimplify.

They also said that since they were in Germany, they could not send a new car but they would send a new transmission that I could change myself. This was 6 weeks ago and still nothing. Very shady.

I wanted this table cloth because we have a square table and it's impossible to find a sqare one at any regualr department store. I do wish it was a little bigger but it fits okay.

Although the album sounds bouncy and punky the lyrics are pretty dark and brutal at times and well sang with an occasional scream to back them up. The guitaring is fast and technical, and full of unusual timing. There is a great variety of tracks from hardcore to acoustic to plain old punk but all made very experimentally great use of synth, and keyboards. The great thing about this album is I find myself singing the words to myself randomly even after not listening to it for several months. This album is power pop at its best, if you are thinking of exploring this band I recommend this album rather than the highly disappointing \\"train wreck\\". Check these guys out but be warned these songs are real, real catchy."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Emo","review":"Emo has a certain number of allstars. Ya know the ones that make the genre.

Make Yourself Sick isnt a bad album, but its not good either. Personally the only song i really enjoyed was \\"I Got Punched in the Nose for Sticking My Face in Other People's Business\\". I download this cd just because i heard that song but in the end it was disappointing and didnt live up to what that one song offered...it was like a really hot hooker with a vinarial disease... dont buy this cd at all costs, unless your like the guy below me... its safer just to get limewire and download it.

Is my experience so unique? My experience being the kind of woman that men ignore. I can't be the only one. And Nancy does resemble a horse in pictures I've seen of her.

Everything on the maps was wrong, embassies had long moved locations, restaurants & shops had closed and inaccurate, and became more of a burden than a help.STRONGLY recommend AGAINST this guide.

So soon that Joss was so freakin' upset he went on a rampage and was unstoppable until Serenity was made. As a Buffy/Angel fan I should have known this would be just as good.I just saw this a month ago, so I'm late to the show and sorry I didn't become a Browncoat years ago when the series was on the air. Nevertheless, I came to LOVE this show and feel such regret that we only got one season--and not even 22 episodes. Such a treasure and so ripped out from under us. If you think it looks grungy, confusing and bleak (which I did originally) just try the first episode and you'll fall in love with the oh so wonderful and engaging characters. Don't let the sci-fi/western surface fool you into turning away, you have to give this a chance and you'll be a fan before you can get the second disc in your DVD player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Television show ever","review":"Joss Whedon, who has done such a brilliant job with 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer', and the spin-off 'Angel', came up with something really new and unique with 'Firefly'.This is the non-Star Trek: a completely new and different kind of Sci-fi, a universe with no aliens, just humans who have NOT learned to feed the hungry or create a perfect government...far from it! There is a huge Military/Government/Corporate power which is trying to stamp out the Independents (the Brown Coats). Our 'heros' are trying to live below the radar, to find a life of personal freedom.I recommend these DVDs to anyone who loves driving trips (or getting out on the road on a bike), people who have always longed to 'ride the rails' or jump a freighter (my own personal secret desire), to live outside of society. These stories will appeal to young and old, men and women, who love freedom and an independent life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best show that never got a chance","review":"LIke most people who watched Firefly I never saw it until it came out on DVD and I wanted to cry because I realized the show was over before it had ever gotten started. The plot, setting and character dialogue is sharp, witty, and way above par for a pilot season series. I honestly don't know why FOX cancelled it, but as a huge fan of Joss Whedon I will mourn the loss of this show. I recommend it it to anyone who enjoys sci-fi and intelligent humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Firefly, the series","review":"Firefly is a wonderful show. If you saw it on network and found it confusing, that's because it was shown out of order. It's rare that a series can bring nine characters together and have it work. They are distinct personalities in a very believable future where horsemen are right at home with faster than light travel. If you're still not sure, rent the series before you buy - or watch Serenity which introduces the characters and environment and see for yourself. Firefly is a definite keeper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FIREFLY ROCKS !","review":"VERY STRONG CARACTER DEVELOPMENT. THE SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE DONE LIKE THEY ARE USING A HAND HELD CAMERA.

It froze a few times but that was because I had paused it for an extended amount of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Firefly-Intrigue/Love/Hilarious/Scary/Adventure/Morality","review":"A wonderfully integrated ensemble cast that is story driven with witty and original dialogue set against a western frontier view of the far regions of space 500 years from present.Serenity , the name of the rugged but versatile freighter of the Firefly class cargo ships, is the home and lifeline of Captain Mal Reynolds his crew and passengers.Only 14 stories were produced before the clueless Fox Studios executives axed the show after much boneheaded TV time slot planning.But Universal Studios bought the rights to produce a movie with all original members present to continue the story after seeing the phenomenal sales of the DVDs and the loyalty of fans around the world, the exciting, loving and talented actors and the persistence of writer and director Josh Wheadon.The movie Serenity is in production now with a release date of 22April2005.The Firefly DVD set is a must own with some of the very best stories Television has ever produced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you Big Bang Theory","review":"Had it not been for a mention on The Big Bang Theory chances are I never would have watched this show. But one night while surfing Netflix I came across Firefly and remembered it was once talked about on Big Bang. It was love at first sight. I write this review with my Jayne Cobb hat on my head. There is only one (in my opinion) bad episode and my only gripe is that on the streaming episodes each started with a voiceover of what Firefly was all about. It's not on the Blu-ray. The shows look great and I look forward to watching each episode over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show!","review":"I have to admit I never watched Firefly on television. In fact I saw Serenity several times and I loved it. So I decided to see how it all started. This pilot was everything I expected and I look forward to the next episode."},{"rating":"2","title":"I only wish","review":"That i had started watching Firefly earlier. I dont think i'll be able to seriously ever understand why this seriously, superb and engaging show ever got cancelled. There is so much going with it in the 14 episodes that were aired. I'm pretty sure it had to do with TV ratings and such. It was a mistake though. I'm only glad that i was able to have the opportunity to check out and enjoy a show that kept me coming back. With its great characters, engaging dialogue and some all around quality action.Having watched this whole series. I can say without a doubt Firefly will go down as one of my top 10 favorite TV series for some time to come. The collection is high quality and has a few extras packed in as well. Its a decent price for a collection that is worth so much. Give Firefly a try and when your done you will see what others like me already know.That sadly quality shows get cancelled well before their time, but this one will continue on for some time to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic show","review":"I only got to see this show in 2005, because when it originally aired I thought, \\"I don't want to see any Westerns.\\" But this show is more science-fiction, action, drama, comedy, and actually everything you would want in good TV, then true Western. I can't believe they aren't making more episodes- they should BRING IT BACK!!!! I saw the whole series in 2 evenings because it was so good, I didn't want to stop watching. It does end in a strange place- so many questions unanswered and relationships just begining to develop. But now there's a movie, so we can find out more about River and hopefully some more characters hook-up(the movie hasn't come out here yet, so I don't know). They really should make more of this show! It is truly great story telling and imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Firefly: Good to have you Back","review":"I Loved this series when it first aired, and was sorry to see it cancelled. But after watching the DVD's, I was reminded of just how good the series was. Firefly, takes place 500 years in Earth's future, and follows the avdentures of the crew of the spaceship, Serenity. The series theme is good Sci-Fi, and the show also has a Great sense of humor, with interesting characters. I think once you watch the first few episodes, you'll be hooked. I know I sure was. Enjoy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Firefly, Will it return?","review":"Wonderful Series which was unfortunately cancelled before it matured. Great cast of characters, including 3 hot ladies. Another great idea and concept from the infamous Joss Wheaton. Too bad the Network didn't see it that way. I predict after the movie makes it's round in the theaters that it will be resurrected again and the series will have a very long run as did Buffy and Angel. I hope so anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truely great series","review":"Still a great show. The networks made a big mistake when they cancelled this one. Would love to see another movie based on this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waiting for the italian version...","review":"I bought this set for two reasons: to be able to finally see at work my (then new) Blu-ray player and because also loving this series, despite the passing of the years, there is not even a whisker of an Italian version, although at the time Firefly was broadcast on pay per view italian channels.For the rest, there is little to say, the events narrated in the series are well known, the quality of the product, as well, and I am grateful that - not being a native English speaker - can I obtain the subtitles that are, as always, of a high standard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome Series","review":"This series was amazing. I'm not a star trek fan nor did i watch this series when it aired, but i decieded to check it out after i watched the movie Serenity. I liked the movie, but i loved the series.

Great for anyone, not just sci-fi watchers."},{"rating":"2","title":"best show ever made","review":"Maybe the title sounds exaggerarated but Id disagree I cant believe fox canceled this.

Also features dolby surround sound and closed captions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserves a return to TV!","review":"This may not be the best ever scifi show on earth, but it was unique in its own right and despite being mistreated by Fox during its original run, it has managed to build and maintain a loyal fan base and spawned a theatrical release (available separately from Amazon).If any TV executives are reading this, they should realize that this would be a great pickup for them. There is a build-in fan-base and the re-emergenence of the genre (from LOTR, other theatrical releases, to BSG, Stargates, Lost, 4400, Invasion, Surface, Triangle, etc) would bode very well for new episodes of Firefly.All in all, this DVD set is very reasonably priced for what you are getting: a quality and rather unique/original sci-fi show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make more episodes and I will buy them!","review":"I suppose Firefly does not need yet another rave review, but I cannot resist adding my comments. (And this is the first time I have posted a review on Amazon.) My wife and I have been watching these episodes on DVD and are frantic because there are only two left to view. Our college-age daughter told us about this show. I went to see Serenity in the theatre with her and her friends and loved it. My wife and I got hooked on Firefly with the very first episode on DVD. This series is so good it could have been on HBO. I plan on buying the Serenity DVD and I would gladly purchase any feature-length sequel or any set of additional TV-style episodes. I fear that the television and motion picture industry is so devoted to producing least common denominator crap that they will not revive Firefly, but if they did, I would buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story, Great Setting, Great Cast!!!","review":"This is one of the most interesting and sci-fi real stories I have ever seen. I like the more realistic future shown; ships do get dirty, food is always an issue, police force is lacking and pirates are all over. These everything is clean and civil is getting very old.The casting was awesome. I could really get into the story, the actors really brought the world to life. If they ever read this I would like to give you a HUGE \\"THANKS!!!!\\"I do want to say at least once, \\"Who ever decided that Firefly was not worth at least three seasons is a bit out of touch with the public.\\"I cannot wait to see this show to DvD.

Yet such is the case with \\"Firefly.\\" What a magnificent work it is...what a \\"shiny\\" gem! There isn't a character with whom you don't connect on some level. The entire mood and feel of the show pulls you in and (thankfully) won't let go. Its unforgiveable and untimely cancellation is yet another case in point that TV executives must be chosen more for what they lack than for what they possess. And what they lack is vision, heart, patience, intelligence, individuality, depth, complexity,humanity,and integrity...everything that can be found in \\"Firefly\\" and its characters in abundance. Maybe that's why they cancelled it...they looked bad by comparison.Buy this series. Buy the movie \\"Serenity.\\" The only thing you'll regret is the fact that the story ends and that it took us this long to 'get it.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Short, but sweet...","review":"Love it, love it, love it! it's a damn shame what happened to this show, but at least there's this DVD collection.

One of the biggest differences between the dvd and blu-ray version, outside of the quality, is the ability to \\"PLAY ALL\\" when it comes to the episodes. That annoyed the crap out of me on the dvd version, only being able to play one episode at a time. On the blu-ray u can play all the episodes at one time, a little feature that makes the purchase almost worth while in itself. The Hi-Def quality is pretty great also, a little grainy at times but still much better than the standard DVD. I got this as a Christmas gift for my Brother as the daily deal at a huge discount. If u love FIREFLY or Buffy The Vampire Slayer, or Angel get it, it's a no-brainer. Funny, witty, great plots and sci-fi all in one!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Joss Whedon had a hit...But FOX SUCKS!","review":"Fox was so unfair to Firefly. They didn't air the episode in order, they played the third episode first...How dumb is that? People were very confused and they did a horrible job of advertising it. Fox really screwed the pooch on this one. It was an awesome show. I'm just sad that it got canned before they showed several of the episodes.

The quality of this tv series is truly amazing...The pilot episode leaves you hooked and the last episode makes you cry in utter anguish as to how this series ever got cancelled. Why oh why you'll ask...and would be perfectly justified in doing so...unfortunately we'll never know. It's a little bit of Star Wars, umm without the jedi, and a little bit of Cowboy Bebop, without Ein..unless Joss Whedon planned a lovable furry creature to join the crew eventually...And a whole lot of western, complete with brothels and of course all that goes with it. It is truly sad that it ended before it was allowed to play out a bit..I have only one thing to say..Does that seem right to you?

I was extremely disappointed when it was cancelled. And that's putting it mildly. The acting was superb and the show was intense, funny, or scary depending on the episode. Anyone who knocks the special effects either didn't watch the show or didn't pay attention.

After seeing the first 3 episodes I was hooked. I enjoyed the episodes so much I immediately went out and bought my own set of this collection.This show never should have been canceled. I'm a fan for life. I hope to see a follow up movie soon. If anyone in the TV industry has half a brain they will get this show back up and running fast.

I think it would have been more enjoyable had I seen the series first, but I didn't think the actors showed as much charisma in the TV show Firefly as they did in the movie Serenity. I like it enough to keep it for when stuck in bed with the flu, and really like the captain, but can see why it was cancelled. For Sci-Fi fans I would not miss it, especially if you are planning on getting Serenity the movie for your DVD collection too."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you don't buy this, you're gay.","review":"You heard me. This show is a brilliant blend of scifi, western, drama, action, and horror. My sixteen-year-old, Dawson's Creek-watching, scifi-hating sister loves this show. So do I. And so do you; you just don't know it yet.Also, if you don't buy this DVD, you sleep with men. Or if you're a woman, than the other thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series","review":"I loved the series on DVD, and the Blu-Ray is a good step up.

Fun characters, good sometimes great stories. Fun times!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Show Ever...well, darn good anyway.","review":"I loved this series, and was extremely dissapointed when it was canceled, just like many others. Excellent humor, complete characters, and a universe that had texture, not just a cardboard set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy","review":"I love this tv series. If you like this, I would also recommend buying the movie in blu ray. It's all good."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars and not over-rated","review":"Someone must have hacked Amazon's rating system. That is what I thought when I saw that this series had 5 stars with over 2000 reviews. But the accolades are well deserved. I am not a TV watcher. I never watched a whole episode of Star Trek and I found Star Wars boring. But I loved this series. It is beautifully acted,witty and irreverent. I have shown it to a half dozen people and they were all enchanted."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Greatest Television Shows of All Time","review":"Firefly is one of the greatest tv shows of all time. It's so cleverly written and well directed that I can't even believe it was ever cancelled. The movie Serenity was amazing as well, but that movie could have provided another season or two since they had to rush the storyline and left so many things unfinished. When I finished watching all the episodes of Firefly and Serenity, I honestly felt like I had an addiction that could no longer be fufilled. Many thanks to Joss Whedon for making such an amazing series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good- but not a classic-too much immorality","review":"I know I'm going to get low scores but here goes. Right off the bat mybiggest complaint is the over the top sexual and violent situations.35 years ago this show would have been rated R which is what I would give it. I bought this set based on the recomendations of others on Amazon.You can have a decent show without all the immorality. Stargate Atlantis blows this show away and doesn't have near the sex and violence of firefly.The idea of a futuristic Western is good but I thought Joss Whedon should of had more \\"Western\\" in the series. I don't consider this a classic like Stargate,the early Star Wars, Dr.Who or Star Trek. The actors were a great choice and they did have the spark of a cast that seemed to bounce off each other well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe these reviews","review":"I bought this series after reading the glowing reviews on this list. This was a serious mistake. This series is flawed to the point of tawdryness. The characters are cardboard stereotypes (the hooker with the heart of gold, etc), the situations hackneyed, the dialogue cliched, the plots boring and predictable, the production values second-rate. In addition, the casting director seems to have chosen a group of actors who are uncharismatic to a degree that one would not conceive was possible except by direct intent. The standard of excellence for such series is the new Battlestar Galactica; this series is not worthy to lace up BG's space boots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misled","review":"5 stars for content, but I ordered this thinking I would be getting the DVDs with 4 different sleeves, like a version I already own. I bought this one as a Christmas gift and when I received it WEEKS later... It was one small case with 4 disks, rather than being in the more box-set style. The pictures on this item is completely different than what I got."},{"rating":"1","title":"Firefly season 1 - blu-ray","review":"I loved Firefly till Joss Whedon kinda ruined it by killing off half of the team in the Serenity movie instead of rebooting the franchise. This said, the blu-ray looks very grainy and all of the space scenes looked out of focus. I don't really think one have to blame the lenses on this one: when you are selling High Definition, you're expected to give High Definition, not low-def rendering of the CGI's and ultra compressed episodes cramped in the smallest set of blu-rays. Not happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"product description not accurate","review":"The DVD was fine but does not contain the three un aired episodes as stated in product description.I bought it solely for the three extra episodes so was very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun show... any recommendations for a better one?","review":"I enjoyed the shows a lot, but I certainly didn't expect \\"Firefly\\" to be real science fiction. It reminded me of some of the humorous episodes of Star Trek. We certainly didn't demand that Star Trek be excellent, just that it be entertaining. \\"Earth II\\" has been the only sci-fi television show that I've seen that really explored possibilities in a mostly intelligent fashion.Speaking of which, I wish there WERE some really GOOD sci-fi TV shows... if anyone can recommend such, I would be grateful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a masterpiece","review":"I first saw Firefly on Sci-Fi Channel UK at the end of last year and liked it so much I ordered the DVDs from the US, even tho' they're Region 1 and more awkward to play in Europe. Without exaggeration this is the most amazing piece of television I have seen in a very long time! Subtle, clever, funny, brilliantly acted by all nine of the prinicipals, beautifully directed and filmed. The cast are amazing, the characterisations fantastic! Artistic and compelling at the same time!I could not recommend these DVDs more highly and if Universal (who apparently now own the rights) have any sense, they will resurrect Firefly as a movie or (even better) a new series with as many of the original actors and actresses as they can round up (hopefully all of them). Everyone I meet over here who has watched it is awed by what these guys accomplished.What were Fox thinking when they cancelled this show?"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a shame....","review":"When Firefly first started on Fox I only watched one episode because it was on the worst night for television: Friday. After seeing that one episode I was hooked. Next thing I know, Fox decided to cancel the brilliant show. It's a shame that shows with complex characters and great writing don't survive on television yet shows like The Bachelor thrive. If you want to see storytelling at it's best, you'll watch Firefly. After watching, you'll be left wanting to hear more stories about the crew on Serenity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just plain great and a must have","review":"Best written and acted science fiction television show ever. That this was allowed to go off the air (while Fox continues to allow all kinds of junk to be renewed) is a shame. Buy this together with the movie \\"Serenity.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Firefly still flying","review":"I didn't discover Firefly until the reruns hit the Sci-Fi Channel - call me a late bloomer. What a find this show is - witty, action-packed and dramatic, a rare combination. The DVD extras are few, but a wonderful interview with cast and crew, who were truly heartbroken when it was cancelled. It also adds another layer knowing the fans rallied to resurrect the show as a movie. Though this is a great collection for those who are just finding the show, I'm leaving off one star for myself, and the fact that I did not buy the newest, expanded DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series","review":"I watched the first couple of episodes on fox when it first came out and I was little more then confused as i watched it but i have just recently watched all 14 episodes and Serenity, and have to say that this is one of the best shows i have ever had the pleasure of watching. Great humor, great lines, just enough action, and a perfect cast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply outstanding","review":"As for me, Firefly/Serenity world is just the best Sci-Fi movie universe for this moment.

Thanks, Carlos, Carlothos@aol.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best TV Series EVER!!!","review":"If you like good TV - or good movies - this is something you NEED. Firefly was created by Joss Whedon of Buffy fame, and this is a fabulous series.Fox decided that they didn't want Joss et al to air the show in the order that it was written, thus people didn't get a true representation of how great it really it. 16 episodes were made (and are on the DVD) but they only aired (I think) 11...Don't let Fox's idiocy keep you from missing out on something truly great!Oh, and don't let the idea of a space western scare you off either - the character development is fabulous, and you will find yourself watching these episodes over & over & over... and wishing for more!and when you wish for more, get Serenity!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What TV series should be!","review":"This is a really wonderful series. It has action, humor, intelligence, swashbuckling, romance, it makes you think, and a really great premise. I can't believe they stopped making it after only 14 episodes--and we still have shows like Dancing with the Stars on TV!The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was that the actor who played Shepherd Book at times seemed a little unbelievable. I can't put my finger on exactly what it was, but he just rubbed me wrong at times. If I could be more specific with my rating, I would have said a 98.5% out of 100%. Really, you need to see this series. Great!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"And So It Goes","review":"Short and sweet: the fate of this series is perfect proof that no TV network has the slightest clue. Fine and shining, Firefly and Serenity were just too good to be properly appreciated. Stars Wars is just so much brainless fluff; if Lucas and Spielberg and the rest were as good as they think, they would have done this. Word."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was hooked BEFORE I ordered it and glad I did!","review":"I would just be repeating all of the wonderful reviews if I went into detail, but I was hooked into this DVD before I ever saw the first episode. I had never heard of Firefly before July, 2004, as I was living in an area without access when it first appeared. I was told about it by an online friend who worked as an extra in the upcoming movie, Serenity. Ordered it sight unseen and have watched it three times already and am showing it to anyone who will sit still! This is entertaining, character-driven sci-fi at it's best. The posibilities are unlimited and we can only hope it's a long and productive franchise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show","review":"Loved it. Great show. Very happy to find on blu ray. Glad to be able to own. Awesome buy. Makes great gift as well"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show...Great DVD Set. Fox is incompetent!!!!","review":"Fox made a big mistake in taking this show off the air. Every episode is great and I was stoked about the 3 unaired shows. I won't get wordy, these are great so buy this DVD set; you won't be disappointed....except in Fox for canceling the show."},{"rating":"2","title":"See this before you see the movie!","review":"Just read in Hollywood Reporter that a feature film version of Firefly has been green-lit by Universal (who acquired the rights from 20th Century Fox)! I'd suggest buying this DVD set and getting acquainted with the characters before seeing the film.Firefly, right off the bat, had compelling, complex characters, extraordinary SFX (which, instead of substituting for good writing, served only to create a realistic, gritty atmosphere), and a nuanced premise that was unique among the space opera genre. It managed to create action and suspense without the usual laser-filled space battles.Buy the DVD, and go see the movie when it hits the theaters. Who knows, if it all sells well, maybe Universal (which may soon be owned by NBC) will revive it as a series in the future for NBC or Sci Fi Channel.If not, at least you'll get to see all the episodes in the correct order, unlike the way they were shown on Fox."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brown coats bible","review":"Yep.

(Totally worth purchasing because you will watch Firefly again and again)","review":"I had heard that Firefly was really good and read the multitude of reviews here on Amazon (most of them 5 stars). And now that I've watched the entire series (including Serentity, the movie) I agree 100%!! In my opinion, Firefly is very nearly the perfect TV series. It's only real flaw is that it ends after 14 episodes. The show is a wonderful blend of dialog, action, humor, mystery, setting, character, science, soundtrack, and visual appeal. Put all together, it's a show to watch again and again. For me, that fact uniquely makes the purchase of this collection the best bargain of all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very fun series","review":"Had not even heard of this series before stumbling on it via a Amazon cross reference.

Its well written, entertaining and so full of wit that you've got to watch it at least twice to catch everything. Cancelling this series was a horrible decision that proves TV networks are not to be trusted with shows of this quality... If you're a fan of space, westerns, Joss Whedon, Nathan Fillion or just like good TV that is well written, buy this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My wife and I went to the movies only to find the film we wanted to see had sold out. Instead of hanging around for the next sho","review":"A few years ago, my wife and I went to the movies--only to find the film we wanted to see had sold out! Instead of hanging around for the next showing, we bought tickets to a movie we had never heard of called SERENITY. As we exited the theater, I said “That might be the best science-fiction action movie I have ever seen!�?(And, as someone who has been reading \\"real\\" SF since the '60s, I don't think much of most movies purporting to be SF.)She not only agreed (and she is not usually a SF fan) but suggested we come back in a week and see it again. We did.Then someone told us about the television series.After renting it three times, we figured it was time to own the damn thing. It now ranks with NORTHERN EXPOSURE, ALLY McBEAL, and SEX AND THE CITY as her favorite series (and the only ones we own for repeated viewing)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why did they cancel this, I ask you?!","review":"I first saw Serenity at the movies and loved it. What a ride. And I have always liked Joss Whedon's other series and friends have continually said...you should see the Firefly series. I know you will like it. So after seeing Serenity....I decided....I want to know what came before. And what a great albeit short series it is. Lots of fun, adventure and drama all at the same time. Whether or not you are a Joss Whedon fan....this is a great series to check out."},{"rating":"2","title":"do yourself a favor- watch this show now","review":"i recomend this show to everyone ever. Joss Weaton is absolutely brilliant, and the show crackles with his special sence of humor. The show was clearly a labor of love for everyone involved, including the directors, writers, scene designers, prop guys, lighting guys, and most especially the actors, who all talk glowingly about what a positive experience it was working on this show. they really form a family, and the lessons the show has to teach us... oh i just can't go on enough. beyond the personal aspects, there's the social comentary laid just below the surface. as joss said, by combining a futuristic sci-fi with an old school 70s western, he's really formed a space where he can talk about the present.watch it now, and you will have to buy it, just for all the fun extras."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a rabid fanatic, BUT..","review":"I have a few star trek dvds and they're ok.. i'd never heard of this series before i bought the set of disks. I'm an engineer and am critical of 'water running uphill' - physically impossible plot and story lines cause they're insulting. I found nothing like that here. For my money (as a novice to the series) - i'd take this series over star trek. It is more plausible (less 'magic') and to me (imho) more entertaining. Despite the one star rating critic lambasting 'fanatics' for packing the reviews - i'd not classify myself as a fanatic - i don't care for \\"Buffy\\" - too much implasible magic and a 'star' who once remarked \\"I can't believe i have to work with these people!!\\" after showing up hours late for an appointment. Non-professional to say the least. Buffy is a 'groopie - teenybopper' show.. I'm over 60, so it doesn't appeal to me. This show isn't in that category for my nickle.. Too bad there's so little of it. CheersRabbit"},{"rating":"2","title":"Got a bad rap, deserved better","review":"This series got off on the wrong foot when the pilot wasn't aired. I had trouble figuring out what was going on when it was on the air. Thank God the whole pilot is on the DVD set. It's a great show, that had serious promise.

If you do not own Firefly you are missing out on some great characters and stories. I cannot say enough about the development of this show and where it was going before FOX canceled it.

To finish up just buy it you will be pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, funny, entertaining show, for the most part","review":"It's sad that this show had such a short life.

So when I do my research I generally look for shows that are raved about by the fans (I just ordered the Farscape complete series last weekend), well this shows cup runneth over with praises. It doesn't disappoint. Buy it, borrow, rent it, etc., you'll be glad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sigh...","review":"Warning, if you start watching this show you may finish the series in a day or two and be left with a sad feeling of what could have been had the show run another 2 or 3 seasons.This is my first review and I'm hoping with the 2k other positive reviews someone at FOX starts noticing the potential cash cow they have locked in the basement before the cast grows too old and heavy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whedon's Greatest Injustice","review":"Firefly depicts the adventures of Captain Malcolm Reynolds and his crew on board the ship, Serenity, after they picked up two fugitives on the run from the totalitarian government known as the Alliance. It really is a show you have to stick with for the first disk or two, but, it more then well pays itself off by the third disk. With its western like hold ups, futuristic setting, and cleverly plotted missions and tasks, this show is almost like a hybrid of Star Treck, Bonanza, and The A Team, except a whole lot better. Cancelling this show might have been Fox's worst mistake. It is funny, clever, exciting, and suspenseful, Firefly is an excellent purchase and a steal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great episode!","review":"Well acted, well written, and with plenty of action this is one hell of an episode.

UK review","review":"For anyone who's seen Firefly before then nuff said. You all know that it's a criminal shame that the show only lasted 13 episodes. A peculair combination of the Western and Sci-Fi genres that really works. Some of the best writing Joss and his crew have ever done, some great acting and characters. Top show.As a UK resident for some reason we don't have Firefly on blu-ray so I took the plunge and ordered it from the US. I was a little concerned as the blu-ray is in NTSC while we watch stuff in PAL over here. However I don't really think it made any difference to picture quality. It looks great, the extras are nice - the cast lunch is entertaining. Basically it's the same great show but in a nicer format and taking up less space on your shelf.It also took a ridiculously short time to come over to the UK and I somehow avoided paying UK customs duty on it (it was just under the value bracket miraculously!)Any yes the blu rays do play on the UK players."},{"rating":"1","title":"Firefly, a word of caution","review":"I enjoyed the series very much, and was surprised to see that there were some episodes that were not aired, and that was the main reason for buying this set. However all of the episodes that are in this collection WERE aired on the Sci-fi channel in the UK. I don't know if this is true in the U.S.A., but this makes the cover statement at the very least misleadind. There is even a reference to 'Objects in Space' in the special features section as having been aired.

The digital remastering was top-notch though there are certain things I would quibble with the digital decision makers.I like the fact both the DVD and Blu-Ray versions included a couple episodes that never aired. I look forward to the day when Whedon can continue lensing a full season's worth of episodes, preferably with the same actors maybe set ten years down the road. Either that or digital technology gets to the point where digital actors could be generated to create a virtual domain of new episodes.

I really enjoyed it. I think those zombie things are freaky but they never really show much gore. I like all the characters each is very different. I thought the westerness of it was a nice suprise.

The entire series, in the proper order (it was shown out of sequence on TV initially). Great background music, good filming, great interaction between characters.

Every crewman on the space ship has a character study done on them for at least an episode, you really get to know them well. The Hospital episode is the best!Joss Whedon did the film movie sequentially with the story off the TV series, so it continues the plot for the characters, but with or without the movie, I highly recommend this show for anyone into SF, anyone who liked Babylon 5, anyone who likes Stargate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Firefly","review":"I knew of the show before Serenity, I love how the movie is so straight forward and the replace all of the mushy scenes with Humor, its great"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"Firefly sets the standard for SciFi.

Baseball games took over when this show was supposed to air and it was never played in the correct order it was designed for so people just couldn't latch onto this well thought out, creative and beautiful show. My family and friends cannot wait until the movie Serenity comes out in Septmeber. Of course, we would've preferred a whole series run for like five to seven years but getting a big screen movie is more than we could've hoped for. Spread the word and give this box set as a gift to anyone who appreciates good, quick witted humor, drama, action, suspense and so much more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show","review":"This is a great series.... My wife and I watched the entire series in about 4 days. I wanted to add this review to the many other '5 star' reviews to let Fox know how much they messed up. Too bad this show didn't air on a real network!Jack"},{"rating":"2","title":"Firefly fan!!","review":"The creativity of Josh Whedon (and the chosen few that worked with him) resulted in something smart, fun, and different. The actors made interesting characters come alive. I'm looking forward to more!I'm not usually a fan of sci-fi and I didn't watch Firefly when it originally aired on TV. But a friend loaned me the DVD collection and now I'm hooked. Had to have my own set to enjoy over again and share with family. The show is somewhat complex and the use of multicultural expressions and dress was at first a little confusing. Being able to listen to the additonal commentaries helped \\"flush out\\" the back story.I've enjoyed Firefly more in DVD format than if I'd watch it when it first aired. The shows were not broadcast in the preferred order, and a couple never made it on at all! I highly recommend watching it in the complete format of this DVD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Episodes please","review":"This is such a excellent series and I am amazed that they canned it after so few episodes. The character are great and the story lines are captivating leaving you wanting more. Let us hope that, like the animated cartoon series Family Guy, the DVD sales generate enough interest that they will resurrect the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"There are few (if any) TV shows better than this!","review":"This is perhaps the best television show that has been made in the past decade. Wonderful characters, captivating stories, and a certain flair that can only come from Joss Whedon. The DVD set is a great collection of all the episodes, and is well worth the price.Looking forward to the movie in 2005!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Sci-Fi Series over the Last 20 Years","review":"The is hands down one of the best Sci-Fi Series ever created.It is a shame it was dropped by Fox.For all fans look for the movie that is to be released in 2005 called Serenity, maybe Firfly will return to primetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Sci-Fi","review":"What can I say...?Didn't get the ratings, but it was fun to watch! Good example of over-analyzing the data and not asking the right questions...:-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooked","review":"bought this Blu-Ray few days ago and got hooked to it. Mix of sci-fi, drama, action and many more. Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sci-Fi plus Western equals a lot of fun!","review":"With my Prime membership, I'm just beginning to dig into the vaults so to speak. Firefly delivers on all levels: action, spaceships, gunslingers, intrigue, suspense, and above all, great acting. With The Avengers coming out next summer, I wanted to see what director Joss Whedon brings to the table outside of Buffy and he does not disappoint here. Tight direction, a perfect balance between character development and whiz bang moments, this show is impressive to say the least. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply put, the best Sci-Fi TV Show ever","review":"It's difficult to add much to the 3,000+ comments already made about this TV series. So I'll just add this: If you haven't seen the series, do yourself a big favor and buy this set. Brilliant is an over used term especially with regard to TV, but this series is truly brilliant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong format?","review":"I love the series and some of the special features on the DVD were great. BUT when I tried to play it on my computer, I got the message that it wasn't formatted for my area, something the buyer failed to mention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's get real here....","review":"Problem with this episode, is that the bad guy didn't die.. Seriously, he should have been so dead. I am retired military, and he would have been dead, dead, dead.... Writer's f/u'd on this one... Makes it a loser....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Firefly, the first and last season :(","review":"I am a late comer to the firefly fan group, but having watched the movie (Serenity) and season one which is the first and last season of the show; I share in the cast and fans sadness that this show did not continue for many seasons. The depth of the characters and back stories was exceptional and the \\"moral\\" of the story, if you will, rivaled the star trek series. That should make you a fan as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally see it as it was meant to be seen...","review":"For anyone who missed the amazing opportunity to see this show for the limited time it was on TV, I strenuously recommend this boxed set, you will not be disappointed. For those of us lucky enough to have seen it during its short run, this DVD set is all that remains, and we relish finally being able to see it as it was meant to be seen. In its original order, in widescreen format as originally shot, and with original content, before Firefly had to go back and change things in an effort to make it work for Fox. The commentary itself is a reason to buy this set, never before have I seen and heard more passion from a cast and crew than those who had the pleasure to work on this show and who wholeheartedly believe that it is the most fulfilling work they will ever do. And to Joss Whedon, who created this beautiful masterpiece and continues to work everyday to see that it finds a way to continue, all Firefly fans are greatly appreciative."},{"rating":"2","title":"No power in the 'verse can stop Firefly!","review":"Except visionless network executives, that is. Never have I been as drawn to a TV series as I am to this one. Firefly is a still largely undiscovered gem that needs to be seen to be believed. The entire production is better than most motion pictures and leagues better than anything I have ever seen in a television show. If you haven't seen it, you should."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Quite possibly the best science fiction show on television. The science was subtly understated in that it doesn't hit you in the face but you catch a glimpse of something really high-tech and cool every once in a while. The fiction was top-notch with real human emotions and stories that actually dealt with the characters (instead of mostly external entities and aliens in that other unnammed sci-fi franchise) If firefly were playing today, it would be my favorite show since Buffy is now gone. I am very unhappy that it was cancelled even after all this time. In fact, Firefly was quite possibly the best television show on television. If I can't have you I can at least have your DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Babylon 5 with a western touch","review":"I didn't think I would like it when it first started. The theme music was catchy and then the stories started to develop into a watchable and interesting time line. Trust Fox not to give it a chance, like all the other good shows they have dropped maybe someday these will come back to haunt them especially if Fox has to rerun the shows to retain viewers. This is a watchable, interesting, Space Opera exactly how the star wars series started. WATCH IT! YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show, cancelled too early","review":"It's hard to say what Firefly would have become had it not been cancelled after it's first season, but it had the makings of the best show I've seen in quite a while. It's just one of those gems that all too seldom make it to you TV screen, a well-written series in a well-crafted world full of interesting characters who you actually care about and enough material in their histories alone to have kept the series running for years without getting old. It's a shame that a combination of expensive sets and high production values combined with poor ratings doomed it, but I would highly recommend to anyone who is a fan on the sci-fi genre (and many who are not) to pick up what few episodes were made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series","review":"Belongs in any science fiction fan's library. If you have the DVD's it's not worth upgrading to the BluRay, but if not, this is the way to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Firefly-something new that will not go away","review":"One of my sons friends brought \\"Firefly the Complete Series\\"over on Christmas, and suggested we might like it. 4 of the 5 of us like good science fiction. Notice i said \\"good\\". Afterseeing the just two of the first disk episodes, i thought\\"This got cancelled?\\" ( I bought the disk on saturday and watched all the episodes by Sunday evening)Josh must have made some executive mad cause he is so talented. To cancel a series that a year later, when out on DVD, has Amazon sell out the preorder in 24 hours is remarkable. I know that you will enjoy this series if you like Sci-Fi like Stargate SG-1, Enterprise, Star Trek the Next Generation, etc.. I give Josh's series two thumbs up. I can't wait to see the Movie next year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful show!","review":"I wasn't able to watch this show when it aired... but I bought the DVD set and I completely hooked. My wife and mother love it and we've stayed up late these past few nights to watch another episode.The only shame here is that Fox dropped the ball... Even though I've always been a trekkie, I'd much rather watch this. Heck, I'd even say that this is the ebst sci-fi series I've ever seen, and that is saying a lot.Buy it, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't believe they canceled this series","review":"Firefly has been one of the few shows I've sat through and watched the entire series in a few days. I'd get up every day excited because I knew I'd be able to watch a few episodes that day. When I'd finished the series I actually felt sad that it was over and then decided to start at the beginning again! They were so idiotic to cancel this series. If it would have been marketed properly I believe a lot more sci-fi fans would have joined the ranks and gotten behind it. It's a great show that I believe should still be on the air. I hope someone will pick it up and give it another chance!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not sure how this concept works so well...but it does.","review":"I'll openly admit that I'm in the group of people who had never even heard of Firefly until recently. My sister, who's a few years older than myself left me borrow it.The first episode was a bit of an odd...futuristic space ships mixed with cowboys is a bit odd, but the series keeps getting better and better. My wife and I could not get enough of this series. We watched the entire series in a span of 3 days. Wonderful series, I'd highly recommend it. And if you've only watched the first two or three episodes and can't get into it give it a shot, it really takes off around disk 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Firefly","review":"This is what you saw on Fox and some that were not aired. This was a very good show. Outer space meets western . It was a real shame that Fox didn't give this show more of a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alone in the house laughing outloud","review":"I'm not here to convince anyone to buy this, but just to join in on the collective praise. Nearly every episode had something so funny that I just had to laugh out loud even though I was alone. I think besides the terrific characters, the cinematography is owed a thanks for this. Whether enjoying the witty dialogue or the action, the camera always moves fluidly like you're there. I think its what brought me in and made me the 10th crew member aboard this amazing ship (which has been deemed by a DVD extra feature as the 9th crew member) you can't help but love. In fact, I enjoyed it and laughed more the second time, and plan on going through it again before the dvd comes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best television series ever--don't miss this!!!","review":"It doesn't matter if you don't like sci-fi: this one has it all. Action, drama, romance, humor, and lots and lots of guns. The writing, casting, and acting are brilliant, but more importantly all the elements come together. At first I was upset that I missed this when it originally aired, but then I learned that Fox showed them out of order anyway. The DVD set presents the episodes in the right order, commercial-free, including three never-aired shows. You get a total of 14 episodes including the 2-hour pilot, and nice extras. Also it's presented in widescreen. The feature film, Serenity, is coming next april. For as cheap as this box set is, you just can't go wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as what I'd heard","review":"Like many who have written reviews here, I'd never seen Firefly during its TV run and decided to buy the DVD set based on my faith in Joss Whedon and on word of mouth. I'm halfway through the set and am enjoying the series more with each episode. The pilot, in particular, I thought was truly fine -- I would happily have to gone to see it more than once as a first-run film release. I found the second episode to be a slight let-down, but since then they've only gotten better and better. I can't believe Fox cancelled a program this good. (Wait a minute, we're talking about Fox -- Simpsons aside, I can believe they cancelled a program this good.)Great writing, great acting, great special effects -- an exceptional, kickass series. Hope Joss W. does it justice in the big-screen version now filming.Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Show Ever!","review":"My husband and I actually watched this show from the beginning and we were so disappointed when it was cancelled. This is, by far, our favorite tv show in years. I just bought this dvd set, and I have to say, it makes so much more sense when you see the episodes in order! I will never understand what is going on in the minds of the fox execs...I think they must have had a collective lobotomy on the day they decided to cancel. Buy this set...you will not be sorry. My only complaint is the lack of a \\"play all\\" choice for the episodes. It's not like you're going to turn it off after just watching one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome","review":"Finished watching the DVD from Net-Flix, almost heartbroken when i got to the end knowing that there are no more seasons. The show really pulls you in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible series that ended too soon.","review":"This series was incredible.

So much so that they decided to purchase their own copy on Amazon. However the cover arrived broken, and the DVD doesnt play on our player in Australia so they were pretty disappointed. I have bought DVDs from Amazon before and there wasnt any description about which regions it would or wouldnt play in."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST!","review":"What a great series, fun to watch, humorous, thought provoking, touching. Superb. And once again, Corporate Suits step in to destroy a gem. Idiots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic series","review":"Absolutely phenomenal TV series, too bad it was cut short. The series itself deserves five stars, but not only was the case not the one pictured, it had a piece that had broken off when I got it. Not a big deal, it is just nice to know what you are buying, and a bummer when it arrives a little bit broken when purchased new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try Again","review":"I'm sure it didn't help that the premiere episode of Firefly was preempted, at least on the west coast (by a baseball game, if I recall correctly). Those of us who set our VCR's to record it missed it. That said, I did try to watch the subsequent episodes, but I just couldn't get into it. By about the third installment, I realized that every single character in the show could be killed off, and I wouldn't care. So much for Firefly. Please try again with something else, Joss."},{"rating":"1","title":"FOR THE SIMPLE MINDED","review":"There was a good reason this show was cancelled...it sucks! If you are highly intelligent you will not like this mess of a production. The sound track is ridiculous, the dialogue is lame, and the fight scenes are amateur hour intense. I viewed all the great reviews and was misled. If you haven't had an original idea in years you may find some comfort, but basically I would stay away if you really thirst for something new and intense, something well written, which this is not. All the small town barn dances or country whatevers almost drove me mad with boredom. If I wanted a western with dancing I would have rented something from the 1950's. This is somewhere below science fiction, somewhere way below. A total waste of money unless you are simple minded or have a red stain on your neck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow . . . this was bad!","review":"I had high expectations. I had heard from several Battlestar Galactica fans that this was an \\"awesome\\" series, almost as good as Battlestar, so I bought the DVDs . . . uh, No, this is not great science fiction. It is a silly, over-the-top melodrama set in an improbable future with some really bad acting. It's a comic Western (they even talk in campy 19th-century cowboy-speak) set on a space-barge whose crew flies from one ill-concieved scheme to escape-the-law, get-rich-quick, save-the-girl, save-the-universe to another and somehow gets out alive before the end credits. I'm trying to think of another show with a similar flavor, and for some reason, I have to say \\"Desperate Housewives\\" meets \\"Brett Maverick\\" in space -- very campy and contrived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously lame","review":"I don't understand why anybody thinks this is at all good. I'm a sci-fi geek through and through, from all the Star Treks, both BSG's, all the Stargates, Babylon 5 (and it's ill-fated spinoff Crusade), I'm usually cool with anything in space. But my god. Ridiculous? Awful? Cause of severe eye-bleeding? I'm not sure how I can really describe this show. I probably even managed to make it through half the episodes without knowing or caring who was doing what before I gave up and sold it on here to some poor misguided soul. The acting is bad. So is the writing. And the western style is absurd. Why in the H would people redevelop western accents? Is the medieval British accent making a comeback? The whole thing is just a complete waste of a show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"I can not bring myself to sit through an entire episode of this show, although I have tried to watch nearly half of them! The program bores me to such a point I can not even keep myself awake. What I espeacially can not understand is how out of the nine or so characters only Simon interests me at all. I can never tolerate how Joss Whedon's shows swap good dialogue for semi-witty wisecracks. Now I have heard a feature film will be made. Just goes to show one how the world of the cinema has run out of ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"simply awful","review":"If I could give negative stars I would. I remember reading once that startrek was at the time it was created thought of as a western in space. Well the guy who created this series decided just to basically pick up a western series and put in space. Its a stupid series- you can get more entertainment watching old westerns on tv land. IF you into true sci-fi spend your money on Stargate or Babylon 5 or just about anything else because this will dissapoint you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look at the Used....

There is nothing currently running on television that can compare to the creative, interesting, memorable stories of the Firefly crew. Great ensemble cast, fantastic plots, imaginative in every way--you can't say enough good things about this DVD set.

The characters are all incredibly well created, acted, and given the chance to grow and be flushed out by outstanding writing and diversity in the episodes. The graphics are also great and do not hinder the story, as can sometimes happen with TV Sci-Fi. Simply put, this is one of the most unique shows with its mash-up of the wild west and space and it should not be missed. Its a shame it was only on for such a short time."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a most excellent Series","review":"I am so upset that they cancelled this show. Fox is losing alot of money on this.

Not a typical space shoot-em-up (but there is some of that) or a droll dragged out trek through space. It's unique, funny and catchy.

This is a must for Joss Whedon fans or anyone who likes Sci Fi."},{"rating":"2","title":"Instantly Hooked!","review":"I was shown the pilot episode(s) by a friend and went immediately to the store to buy the DVD collection for myself. I found it hard to understand how this show could have been cancelled before it's first season was up. Witty dialog, rich characters, and superb acting make this a gem of a show. Furthermore, Whedon's decision to build the Serenity interior as a continuous interconnected series of sets is genius, and adds so much to the flow of the ship environment. I am an avid sci-fi /fantasy fan, but I do not mindlessly support a show just because it has a space ship and a few laser pistols... This is just good writing. This show could have been set in any venue and it would have still been great. (but then, Asimov once said that good science fiction has a great human story at it's core).The only thing wrong with this show is that it died too soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best. Series.EVER!","review":"Subject says it all. Joss Whedon is an amazing writer. This series has a great cast, is extremely funny and great plot lines. The movie Serenity was amazing and I hope they bring this series back because of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just another glowing review....","review":"I just wanted to add my praise to the huge list already assembled. This show is possibly the best tv ever, and I will never understand why it was cancelled. When my husband and I watched it through for the first time, that's what we kept asking each other. \\"Why in the heck was this cancelled?\\" Although I think I might have an answer. Fear. This show is smart, funny and tragic at the same time, and full of subtleties of detail that could be missed in a single watching. And as we all know, television executives assume we are all stupid, dull, and don't want comedy mixed in with our drama. Well, guess what. Some of us do. A great many of us, if these reviews are any indication. The acting is superior for television, the writing is witty and full of character-specific detail, and the effects are jaw dropping.So, if you love science fiction, love action, love good characters, or just plain love to be entertained, you can't go wrong here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Series","review":"I finally watched this series after hearing so many good things about it for so long. It was too addicting. I couldn't stop until I finished the series and watched the Serenity movie a second time. I hope they bring the series back at some point."},{"rating":"2","title":"FOX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"In my opinion, this is Joss Whedon's best television series. The cast has fantastic chemistry and the writing is terrific. Joss has created an entire sci-fi universe which is easily on par with Star Trek and Star Wars. It's one of the most beloved science fiction television shows of all time. I have yet to meet anyone who has not watched the first two episodes and didn't fall in love with the show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great content, crappy production values on the DVDs","review":"I can't say enough good thing about the actual content of this set. The series is fantastic, and unfortunately way too short. (Thanks a lot FOX). The only reason this isn't a five star review is because the production values on the dvds themselves are really terrible. The menus are simpler than something a three year old can make with iDVD, and the cases are like the cheap ones they put the discs in for the dollar DVD bargain bin at most discount stores. I hope the upcoming bluray release gets more attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shiny","review":"That's one of things you'll learn the meaning of from this enjoyable Joss Whedon ( Buffy, Angel) production. Throw out your concept of a Science Fiction series, because it isn't about the alien of the week or big space battles, heck it only has one episode with a laser gun. It's a well written, character driven, thought provoking tv show about people who are just trying to make ends meet, not rule the galaxy, nor explore strange new worlds...even though there's nothing wrong with that. Bottom line is you'll love this series and wonder what momentary lapse of judgement occured at Fox to let this gem of a series go down the tubes."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a gem!","review":"We saw 'Serenity' over the holidays, and promptly bought the 'Firefly' dvd boxed set. What joy - to discover such a wonderful series now. What heartbreak - to know that only these few episodes exist. We tried to ration them out to make them last longer, but couldn't stop ourselves from watching another and then another, and another. We just finished watching the last episode and are devastated - there is no more! It went way too fast. Yes, it could be classified as science fiction; and yes, there is occasionally, sexual content, but give it a try. The characters are diverse, yet each engaging in their own way, and the cast is superb. It is a series that is so enjoyable as to almost be addicting. We are certainly going through severe withdrawal. It is a gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"How Did I Miss This?","review":"I just learned about Firefly recently and purchased the DVD. How did I miss this when it first aired and why would a TV network cancel such an original series? Didn't the network know what they had? Firefly should have received the opportunity to build an audience based on the quality of the material. Firefly is the best written hour of TV I've seen in some time. It ranks with Deadwood and I'm amazed at how Josh Whedon has brought a western to space, with all the fun, snappy dialouge, and wit that is missing in the recent plodding Star Wars efforts. I'm in my forties and my girlfriend, who is no fan of science fiction, loves this show. I see that the series and the recent film, Serenity, are #2 an #3 on Amazon's DVD Best Sellers list. Hopefully, this will spur some network to resurect the series so more episodes can be made. This really is a gem of a series and deserves a better fate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family hooked two years later","review":"This series continues to pop up on various SCI-FI lists with other respected series' like BSG and STNG, so I watched a couple on SCI-Fi and was hooked. Like the new BSG, this series provides most of its entertainment through the interaction of its widely varied characters, not special effects. I am in that long list of fans willing to pay Joss Whedon now for more internet/DVD releases later ;-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite sci-fi tv series","review":"This is my favorite sci-fi series, though it's admittedly a space western if you're judging strictly. Excellent writing, direction, and cast. It's a shame it was cancelled so early in it's run. When I get depressed on seeing yet another reality show popping up on cable, Firefly still often gets a spin in the PS3."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this Series~Sad they never made more","review":"I bought this on a Gold Box deal for $ 9.99 ... I have watched this series numerous times and will watch it over again. Initially I bought it because Netflix kept timing out and wanted my BF to get caught up with the goodness that is Firefly ... but am happy that I now have this to watch any time I desire. Will likely buy the movie as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Awesomeness!","review":"Best investment ever to any fans DVD collection. 1 Word says it all about this series and owning it on Blu-ray.... SHINY!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Firefly","review":"Absolutly a great DVD collection for the si-fi fan. I purchased two copies, one for my grandson and one for me. I have watched it twice and expect to watch is many more times. Always seem to see something new each time. Great series, too bad they only made one season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Series....This is a must own.......","review":"I loved Firefly and when I saw that this was available on Amazon.......I had to buy it and it was a great price too...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why cancel a brilliant show?","review":"This show was fantastic. I don't understand why it wasn't continued. A tiny consolation is the movie, 'Serenity' which wraps up the TV series and demonstrates that the Firefly universe was as broad and deep and rich as any other series... and we missed out because - for some incomprehendible reason - the networks cancelled the show!It had all the promise of Buffy but with wider appeal. Adventure, humour, thriller, mystery, romance and horror set in the future, with all the grit and grim of today's world. Brilliant acting, fun characters with depth and credibility, stimulating story lines, evocative sets and a horribly catchy introduction tune."},{"rating":"2","title":"Firefly & Farscape....why do they cancel great shows","review":"This series is very Farscape \\"ish\\". If you like Farscape and westerns, you'll love this series. There's humor, drama, love connections and great acting. The show resembles FC because of too many similarities, criminals running from bad guys, living on a ship, being chased by bad guys, hot chicks with guns..There's no character for River in Farscape though, she's way out there......The only thing that is missing is Scorpius and \\"Buckwheat\\" The first few episodes are questionable as the characters evolve, but as soon as you pop in the second disk, you're hooked. Pick this box set up along with the first season of Farscape and you'll never watch that Star Gate show again, except for the current season. Bring back these two great shows!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Space western. Who ever canceled should be fired!","review":"I usualy can only tolerate to see a movie/show 2 or 3 times. I watched this series 4 times back to back and plan to watch many times more. It baffels my why this was canceld. There are series with 4 seasons that aren't half as good. Maybe the sifi channel will pick it up :("},{"rating":"2","title":"What more needs to be said?","review":"700 people, well 699 minus the troll, is loud enough. This series is great tv, and great sci fi. Unless you work at FOX where if its not reality, its not fit to broadcast. Imagine if one of the craptastic reality shows was given this same poor treatment of being shown out of order.Didnt notice if it was FOX that officially released this set, but if they did, and this show wasnt worth every penny, I would wish not a single copy would sell just to give FOX the finger. But what can you do? Its the best show you have never seen. So buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required viewing","review":"Wow! Bought this as a gift - I'd never heard of the show before, and I've long been tired of the horrible excuse for science fiction that's on TV. I was lucky enough that to borrow the DVDs after the recipient watched them - I WILL be buying this for myself.This is an excellent show. The actors, the scripts, even the plots are outstanding. This is a prime example of what's wrong with television - shows like this get butchered by the networks and replaced with mindless drivel.I can't hope to compete with the long time viewers who have already reviewed this set, but as someone who had never heard of the show before, I can assure you that this one is worth the money.Occasionally a little too violent for my young children, but not regularly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best gorram Dvd ever!","review":"This is something everyone should have in their collection..Firefly is not just a tv series that was pulled from the airways WAAAY too soon, but it is also an experience!

It is the best show Fox ever aired. Good thing they were able to make a movie version, maybe they'll be able to bring back the series if it does well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Television Worth Watching - What a Concept!","review":"I too missed this one in the few weeks Fox aired it, but caught it later in re-release on the SciFi channel and was hooked. The cast is delightful, the writing sharp and witty, and the premise interesting. What truly impressed me was how well Whedon created his universe - the juxtaposition of futuristic high tech and retro Old West was not only plausible, but made sense. Whedon re-invented the wagon trains of the push westward on a galactic scale, and set a bunch of characters you could genuinely care about loose in it. This show rings more \\"real\\" in a human sense than any modern reality show - do your intellect and sense of humor a favor and check this out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Whip Me With A Wet Noodle","review":"Honestly, I don't know what my state of mind was during the fall of 2002, but I didn't watch \\"Firefly\\" when it aired on Fox. I must have been out of my freakin mind because this was one of the best television shows ever made.This revelation only recently occurred when I rented \\"Serenity\\" and immediately fell in love with the Firefly universe. The next day, \\"Serenity\\" AND \\"Firefly\\" joined my DVD library and I devoured the entire series in about a day and a half (then promptly re-watched Serenity for the inevitable re-appreciation of the movie).Great characters, hilarious dialogue, and a realistic & well thought-out \\"future\\" are just some of the elements that make this show really work.Buy it, buy the movie, and spread the word! This show needs to be back on the air!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you buy only one box set this year...","review":"Yes I'm a fan, or browncoat as they're called. I can't help it. This really was a brilliant series. Quite possibly the best television series of 2002. When you watch this show enough times, you begin to realize how icredibly well written and directed the show is. Little things pop up that you never noticed before. If you're a film buff, you'll love this tv show. Joss Whedon treats each episode as if it were a small film. Episodes like \\"Objects in space\\" and \\"Out of gas\\" exemplify what a huge error Fox made in canceling this show. But what can I say? It figures. I could go on and on, but I won't.Buy this box set! I guarantee you will not regret it. In fact you'll thank me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Firefly","review":"A wonderfully mixed crew of nine, and raw space adventureI am so sorry ended too soon. Terrific set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need more Firefly","review":"I did not hear of Firefly until after the series was canceled. If I had seen it during its run, I would have been an avid fan. This is a fantastic show and I am very sorry that it was canceled.I highly recommend it. This is one of the best series I have seen. Believable characters and great plots.A must have for the collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the genre so far","review":"It was a good series. I found it at Episode 8 and was really disappointed when FOX cancelled it. Made phone calls and wrote letters. Enjoy it when the Science Channel airs it.I liked the characters. I liked the dialogue - especially the turns of phrases and the interspersed Mandarin (who doesn't think it will all come down to English and Mandarin) reminiscent of Bladerunner.I especially like it when a show is consistent. Nothing drives me out of the room faster than even an inconsistency that breaks the illusion. Firefly managed to maintain perfect consistency and maintain the illusion.COMPLAINT * COMPLAINT * COMPLAINTHow hard would it be to give me a checkbox saying \\"I don't want TV Series in my list of titles\\"? When I'm hunting for new titles for MOVIES I want movies, not television. It just can't be that hard to filter these mostly-pieces-of-crap out of the lists..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great sci-fi series that ended too soon","review":"This was a short-lived but well written and acted series that I enjoyed as much as Farscape. The characters are believable, displaying their flaws as well as their strengths. The stories are a nice twist of genres that gives a new take on the space theme. The only negative is that it is only 14 episodes when I would have liked about 60 or more. They do kind of make up for it with the movie Serenity (also highly recommended), which is a nice conclusion to the story. Your time and money will be well spent on this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whats wrong with Fox??","review":"It seems every time they get these great witty series they go off the air in a blink. Firefly captured me from the very first episode... The caracters, the themes. They should really bring it back!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Art as Entertainment","review":"I only managed to catch a couple of episodes of this show on Fox...by the time I realized that it was something truly worth watching, it was off the air. I had actually managed to forget about this show since then, untill a couple of weeks ago when I noticed the DVD on Amazon while doing some Christmas shaopping. I ordered a copy and promptly forgot about it again. On Christmas Eve, I noticed it in a stack of books and DVD's and thought that it might be fun to watch while wrapping presents. I watched the first DVD Christmas Eve, and finished watching the last one tonight. I will never forget this show again. From the first disc to the last, this is one of the very few nearly flawless television series that I have had the fortune to watch. This show is one of the best examples that I have seen of entertainment becoming art, and art becoming entertainment. The only criticism that I have to offer about this series is that there isn't more of it, and that there isn't more like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Show, Horrible Copy","review":"The low score is reflective of the copy provided on blu-ray, not the show itself. This is one of my favorite shows, ever, so of course I jumped on the great price for a blu-ray copy. But my old DVD box set looks better.

This was a FANTASTIC series and the fact that it's not on any longer speaks to something inherently wrong with modern television(probably television from its inception). My partner, who likes sci-fi, but doesn't begin to even want to watch one episode of Buffy, loved this series. It's just about the best thing ever put on TV - EVER!This is 3rd and 5th season of Buffy good. This is 1-2nd season of West Wing good. If you don't watch this and appreciate it, you belong in a hell watching Paris Hilton reality shows for eternity."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD first experience... how could I have missed it on tv?","review":"Most of everyone has said this is great, so I had to purchase the DVD to see for myself... and saw it all in one sitting, which I have never done for any other show. How could this show have been cancelled?!? I want more of the series! One reviewer compared this show to the crew of the Betty on Alien Resurrection. You know, that's what I thought... but my thought was that it reminded me of the first crew from Alien. And that's not a bad thing! It's good, it's really good. I would have liked to know more about the Alien crew except that wasn't the point of Alien (where the crew existed to get killed off). Firefly also reminds me of the Miles Vorkosigan book series by Lois McMaster Bujold... Space Opera at it's finest. Humor, clever, soap, lots of action. I want more Firefly!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"YES!! It's finally here!!","review":"I can't remember ever being so unhappy about a cancelled TV show before. And it wasn't just me. It was my husband and everyone I knew, including my mother, who is not a big sci-fi fan, but she knows great when she sees it. This was the best character driven show in years, with elements of drama, comedy, horror, thriller, as well as that edge that you usually only get with something done independently of the big networks. But it had enough of a big network budget that the special effects were done flawlessly. It was a killer sci-fi movie, but it was never going to end, you were going to get to watch an hour of it every week! And then, knife through the heart, it was cancelled. I cannot recommend more highly that you buy this DVD collection. See the episodes IN ORDER! See the ones they NEVER SHOWED! And prepare yourself for THE MOVIE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Give Us More!","review":"The last show in the series has just been aired over here in England - it leaves me feeling sad that there are no more episodes and happy that I got the chance to see all the existing ones in the CORRECT order ( I see that in America you were unlucky enough to have a disjointed story line and 3 unaired shows!). I can truly say that I have never seen a series to match Firefly's unique feel. A brilliant mix of cutting edge technology, good ol' back to basic Western magic and superb characters who make you want to get to know each one personally! With so many twists and sub-plots the show always leaves you guessing and looking forward to the next. It is therefore sad and frustrating that no second series is yet planned for there are many unaswered questions and great potential for many more exciting plots.When the Complete Series is released on DVD be sure to buy it and see for yourself that this is possibly one of the best shows every to be aired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a Buffy fan...","review":"Never liked Buffy or Angel.HATE Westerns.Don't even watch TV anymore.But some friends nagged and nagged me to watch Firefly. Whatever. Finally I sat down and watched an episode. And another. And another.Oh no, what do you mean there are only fourteen?No, I'm not one of those petition-signing Firefly zealots. But I really, really like this show.They sucked me in and now I'm addicted. You have been warned. Firefly can be addictive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best SciFi series ever.","review":"I can't say enough good stuff about Firefly. It's part science fiction; part western; and all heart. The characters are what makes this tale come to life. They are all complex and multidimensional, and they all complement each other. Fox's mishandling of this series will go down in history as one of the biggest bungles of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for fun","review":"I had forgot how much I like this show. Until the 10th year reunion on syfy watched all of them again and had to buy them on blu-ray. Once to received it I watched them all again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably the definitive version","review":"Every episode (of course) in Blu-Ray Hi Def - apparently the original SFX were rendered for normal SD TV, so this is as sharp as they'll ever get. Loads of extras, outtakes, interviews - top item!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique, breathtaking, a must buy.","review":"FOX marketed this as a western. I hate westerns. I LOVED Firefly. The final (original?) two-hour episode \\"Serenity\\" is still lovingly saved on my TIVO because we can't bear to part with it. The writers of Firefly created characters that are human - not an idealized or perfect one in the bunch, all have their secrets and flaws. In spite of that (because of it?) the viewer is left with a deep connection and a desire to know them better. This isn't all CGI flash. It isn't just schmaltzy character development and human interest either. Firefly is one of the best shows I've seen on TV in a very long time, and it is a tragedy that FOX didn't realize the gem they had and promote it properly. Buy the DVD set and watch it - you'll see fantastic acting, action, adventure, suspense, science fiction, frontier justice, and yes, great special effects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Buffy!","review":"I didn't see this series during its limited run on tv, but I've been a long-time viewer and fan of both Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel so when a friend recommended I watch this series I ordered the DVD set. What a brilliant series! A true western set in outer space with well-written and beautifully acted characters, a fascinating plot that brings them all together, and buckets of humor, pathos, and adventure. I can't wait until the feature film comes out this month!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Firefly Is the Answer to Star Trek","review":"Gritty, humorous, stretching the imagination... Firefly is the best new SciFi series to be canceled since the original Star Trek, back in the 1960s. These episodes are fun to watch, and with the release of the movie SERENITY at the end of this month of September 2005, I can only hope another few seasons of Firefly and its wonderful characters will again commence in Spring '06 or Fall '06 series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely awesome","review":"I purchased Firefly after seeing a preview for Serenity, the movie based off of the series.

If you like wry humor, westerns, and spaceships, this is the discset for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure magic","review":"This television series got lost somehow among potential viewers as it was short lived. Maybe the gratification factor wasn't quick enough to grab a large viewership. Maybe it was poorly or under promoted. Maybe the television executives long ago traded in their sense of pride in craftsmanship for the almighty buck. Nevertheless, the writing and directing produced a synergy of characters and storytelling unlike anything I've seen on television since Twin Peaks and Babylon 5, not that there are any parallels to be made. Firefly enveloped you with every second of storytelling. In Firefly, character development and synergy are unmatched, and I couldn't help but feel like the crew should be in my own family; when the series ended I felt left behind. The new movie, Serenity, will, I hope, revive the television series, or at least spawn a series of cinematic sequels, that will hopefully fill the coffers of the moguls to keep it going but will unquestionably satisfy the fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're here, you know...","review":"Look, if you're reading this review, chances are you are someone you love really knows what the deal is about this show.

The show is excellent and should have gone on longer.When watching I also thought that it never looked or felt like a fox show. To me it looked more WB then Fox.

Hell Maybe WB can buy the rights from Fox."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outrageously pleasing.","review":"I was aghast to learn that the show that I absorbed on DVD over the course of two days had been cancelled by Fox.

I haven't seen anything like it on TV and fear I may never again.If there's one joy that resulted from the sadness of not seeing the show every week, it's the fantastic DVD set they've put together. The show's magnificent writing, brilliant acting, and visual effects that seem SO REAL are preserved forever!The set offers the show in letterbox format (something US viewers were denied) and allows new viewers to see the show in the original order (not the scrambled order originally aired by the network).I bought 3 sets the day I found out it was available and I'm back to order a couple more for gifts!If you like Science Fiction, Fantasy, Adventure... scratch that! If you want to see a show that will surprise you at every turn and have you laughing, crying, and cheering, buy this DVD set today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally ON","review":"After I finished the last episode of Firefly, I felt the way I do after I've seen a great movie: I wished I could see the whole thing again for the first time!

I am a scifi fan and there is nothing much I can add to the 700+ positive reviews at current, but I will say this...compared to the first 14 episodes of any scifi series, Firefly blows it out of the water. Some series take 2-3 seasons before they start to get really good....Firefly is great from the very begining....buy NOW and watch and watch and watch many many times. Oh and Fox I hate you people for what you did to this wonderfull series."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the few shows actually worth buying.","review":"Firefly is the most plausible depiction of the future I have seen on a science fiction television show. It is incredibly well rounded, with rich and unique characters. The thing I like most about it is its ability to cater to all manner of tastes. For the lowbrow, there are plenty of blatant, up front jokes and then you have the more subtle background gags, some of which you may not notice until your third viewing. Point is, the show never gets old, I'm on my 6th runthrough."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all-time favs","review":"There's not much I can say that hasn't already been said about this show. The writing is excellent and the characters are memorable and real. I own this on Blu Ray and both the audio and video are outstanding.

At the next party you attend, slip in a comment about \\"Browncoats\\" and see what kind of a reaction you get. Expect a blank stare from the uninitiated. However, be prepared for the wildly enthusiastic response from those who have experienced life in Joss Whedon's future. There could be several spin-off conversations about the Alliance with their \\"hands of blue\\" or cursing in Chinese or rooting for the underdog or Companions or any of a hundred other topics about this incredibly rich universe created by Joss. It's a good way to meet interesting people."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great TV-show on an unfair network","review":"Firefly is one of those things you either fall completely in love with or you can't stand.

No warp drive, no beaming, no shields or phasers. Just people on a ship, trying to stay free from government control.At first I didn't get the series completely, but the more I watched it, the more I began to understand all the different plots and levels of the characters. (Personally, I want to know Shepard Book's story.)This series has a lot of leg room to continue.

The worse BR i have looked at, so far. It has an insane amount of film-grain effect added to it. I am sure they thought it made it look grittier, but c'mon! This extra noise makes the compression look poor (because image noise kills compression algorithms.) Using an Oppo player on the original DVD's gives me a better viewing experience and only a bit less detail. If you want to squeeze every bit of detail out of the image, get them; if not, stick to the DVD set and use a good DVD player with HD scaler (like the amazing Oppo!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick and reliable","review":"The product was in good shape and arrived quickly.

I understand that we all need to be environmentally responsible in preserving the planet's resources by not wasting or over indulging however, a product of inferior quality is more wasteful as it does not stand the test of time. Unfortunately, it seems that the aforementioned \\"business\\" tactics are rampant on a planetary scale thereby creating even greater waste by marketing inferior products that must be replaced multiple times.

The actors stay fateful to their characters. But the characters are odd and not well developed or integrated. In particular the characters of the happy-hooker promoting pay-for-sex and homosexuality, and the mental-case playing the professional victim.

All the characters show their flaws and their antics put them not only in great peril but in temporary conflict with each other but the jobs get done, the relationships are strengthened, and you root for the crew of the Firefly.

Somehow this series manages to take the outrageous idea of combining science fiction with the western genre and pulls together something both deeply interesting and incredibly entertaining. The characters are well-developed and, in some cases, very mysterious, and the universe is well-imagined.Of course, everyone knows this series ended well before its time. Many loose ends are left hanging at the end of this series, but, as I understand, the 2005 Universal Studios film \\"Serenity,\\" based on this series, ties up some of those loose ends.

The story-lines were predictable--if not recycled. The action was sparse. The characters were trying so hard to be mysterious that they were uninteresting. What did impress me was how slow paced this show was. It was boring. Very little happened and when something did, it was not pulled off in an exciting way.This show wasn't canceled out-of-hand. It was canceled because it couldn't generate interest.I did like the cast though, and the production values, so I'm giving it two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smart, but did not appreciate the values","review":"Smart writing indeed.

Then another reviewer gives this big long explanation on why it was cancelled. Let me tell you something KAD, Dark Angel could have lasted at least 5 seasons. If FOX was serious about Firefly they should have aired the episodes in the correct order. FOX should have known Firefly wouldn't last if the story arch was out of order. So basically they took off a show that would have lasted to put a shown on that would be aired out of order. I think maybe if FOX aired Firefly in order it might have lasted 3 seasons, but since they didn't the world will never know. I'm sorry that I'm a hard core Dark Angel fan, but I don't know hy Firefly wasn't aired on SCIFI in the first place. It would have saved DARK ANGEL fan a loss of a great show.The only reason why I gave this show 2 stars is because it was very creative of Joss to think of a Space Western"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow","review":"This is probably the best science fiction series ever produced even though there are only 14 Episodes.I have bought one copy of the DVD for myself and another for my Dad and we have both been blown away.

Seriously, I like to think of the show as a long movie because it didn't last. They did that to 'Rome' too, except that was because of other things not related to George Lucas or 'Firefly'. If you were a Han Solo kid, you'll like this show and I'm probably not telling you anything you don't already know. My wife is not a sci fi type. She watches Lifetime movies. I was offended when she laughed at the country-western music accompanying the space ship in the titles. \\"They're mixing genres,\\" I said, it's cool. Trust me.\\" Let me tell you, cousin, she was hooked. She just loves that Nathan Fillion. \\"He was on 'Sex and the City'.

All of the characters on Serenity turn out to be interesting and a lot of fun to watch. The episodes just got better and better for me as it rocketed towards its premature demise. As everyone's said before, it really is a shame that it didn't get a chance to go any further in this format, because finding out about the true story over the course of several seasons would have been a joy to watch. I just hope somebody like SciFi will pony up and bring it back. If Battlestar can be so good on SciFi, why can't Firefly?

Thankfully, the author(s) don't try to dwell on the technical explanations of space travel or other developments of the future. Instead they've woven a plot and story line that develops over many episodes, and focuses on character development. Although seeing a single episode is fun, the real fun is making the connections between the details that are slowly revealed over many episodes; why did Shepherd Book get such sudden and unexpected help from the Alliance? Considering he's a preacher, how come he knows so much about crime and weapons? And what's the story with River, anyway? Two by two, hands of blue?Lots of buzz about this one.

Firefly is an odd mixture of traditional spaceship show and a western all mixed in with bits of asian culture. (which was actually a nice touch I think).That this show was put on air out of order, without even the pilot episode being shown till the *end* of the series was a tragedy. When viewed in the right sequence, as shown in the box set, we have a wonderful and quite unique TV series with some great special effects thrown in.I got to the last episode and swore at the TV because there was no more to watch and cursed the stupidity of TV executives.

Suffering from poor marketing and a poor timeslot, Fox decided to cancel Firefly after only 11 episodes, but this is one series that you shouldn't miss. I have shown the pilot to several friends who were unaware that this jewel existed, and each of them has rushed out to purchase the set.

Joss Whedon's show had vivacity and promise, from its concept to its production, and especially in Whedon's harmonic cast. Hopefully, the DVD will spark new life and interest into Serenity and her travels from one of the few bright producers or Network execs, and we'll see the show fly again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best TV \\"series\\", ever. Period.","review":"When it comes to Firefly, I sometimes find it hard to recommend it. Sure, I've described it as the best TV \\"series\\" ever, but the problem is it's not a series -- just a single season. For that reason, I've dubbed it as \\"the best TV series you'll wish you didn't watch\\" because it's such a tragedy that it was cancelled. I watched the entire season in one sitting and was left wanting more. Much, much more.This show seamlessly meshes numerous different locales, cultures, times and genres into a single story. It's got spaceships and cowboys; humor, horror and drama; American and Chinese culture. Josh Whedon and the cast did such an amazing job that I can't even describe it to you; you'll need to watch it. Sooner or later, you may wish you didn't though. Then again, who knows, if it gets a few thousand more 5-star reviews here at Amazon, maybe we'll see the Brown Coats return some day..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great short-lived series","review":"If you are reading this, you probably already know that you want this! Firefly was an excellent series, and was cancelled wrongly. If you like science fiction involving the edges of civilization, space pirates, and spaceship battle, you'll love this series! There's a definite 'Wild West' feel to this excellent show, and that aspect shows up in some places that will leave you rolling on the floor laughing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Firefly!!!","review":"I love this series... anyone who enjoys sly wit humor, sci-fi, and action will love it!

Once I got the series on DVD I was hooked, with the interesting plots and funny, yet deep characters. I watched practically one of the four discs a night until I finished it. It is a real shame that Fox had to axe this great show after not even a whole season, but this set is nonetheless a great collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirky sci-fi that is more than just special effects","review":"When Fire-Fly was on FOX I recorded most of the episodes (which was hard to do given the erratic schedule). When I watched this set, I enjoyed seeing the shows in order including the never aired episodes; seeing the shows in order allowed me to enjoy more of the arch that Whedon was building for the show's first season.The combination of western/futuristic scenery and clothing was new for me because it was done so blatantly, but it was a creative combination and fitting for a future where humanity is expanding similar to settlers in the old west. What really drew me to this series was the depth that the characters displayed, especially the captain Malcolm Reynolds; in my opinion, the characters show much more depth than the ones on Buffy or Angel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!","review":"Truly a great show, watched it all in one weekend.

The behind the scenes stuff, the 3 unaired episodes, and the acting is fantastic. That Fox cancelled this show only goes to show you that they have no idea of what they had (but were smart enough to market it as a DVD collection- go figure). The director commentary on \\"Out of Gas\\" is particularly outstanding - listen for the comment on the Red Button.The DVD \\"fades\\" between selections are a bit slow and the tech breaks down (streaks on the screen freezes between selections), but the show comes through clearly. This is a must-buy for anyone who liked the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best SciFi Series in a Long Time","review":"I bought the Firefly DVD on the reco of friends. Quite simply this is the best TV science fiction series I've ever seen. It presents a realistic and interesting vision of the far future. The special effects are very good for a television series and the stories are well designed and written. As a big science fiction fan I strongly recommend this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Firefly review","review":"When I watched the first episode of Firefly, I was not too excited about the tv series, but I continued to watch subsequent episodes for awhile, skipped the middle few episodes, and watched what turned out to be the last episode. Then came \\"Serenity\\" movie, which I enjoyed and prompted me to buy the DVD set, which, now, I thoroughly enjoy. I like some of the humor that is interspersed throughout each episode and the idea that Firefly seems to be a futuristic sci-fi western, sort of. Now that I have watched the complete DVD set, I wish that the series was not cancelled. I would recommend Firefly to anyone who enjoys a different type of sci-fi series to the usual \\"let's kill all the aliens in our fancy shape/star ships\\" movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"this show...","review":"Is one of the best shows ive seen in a LONG time.Watch the movie, Serenity, if you like it, buy this series.You'll love it.

I only wish there was more!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't get it...Fox, that is.","review":"Considering the standard of 'prime-time' TV we get, i.e. endless reality, sub-standard comedy (barring 30-Rock) and junk drama, how come this gem was allowed to die? Come on BBC or even Channel 4, there are millions of fans out there and it's your chance to pick this up, create a second season, and show the rest of the world that in the UK at least we still take chances and in doing so, create great TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good acting despite horrible writing","review":"I'm a huge sci-fi fan in general, but this series suffers from a nonsense implementation of an otherwise sound premise. It's basically \\"Johnny Reb in outer space\\". It could be interesting to follow the losers of a futuristic conflict while they struggle to cope after a war. Unfortunately, Whedon phones it in, giving the characters hick accents, pump-action repeater rifles, six-shooters, leather belts and boots, and having them ride horses and rob freight trains, all set to country-western background music. This would have been great if it had been \\"rebels as they would be in the future,\\" but instead we get \\"rebels from the 1850s artificially pasted into the future.\\"The only reason I give this series 2 stars: every actor here does a good job, and the production, visuals and staging are great. If these same actors and engineers had been given a decent story world and decent writing, I would have been a devoted fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why was it cancelled after 14 episodes? It sucks!","review":"I can't believe all the hype about this show. My husband and I started watching the series on DVD right after finishing the Six Feet Under series, which we loved. Maybe we needed more time between shows to lower our standards, because by comparison, Firefly plays out like a high school production. The dialogue is poorly written, the jokes are predictable, the characters are one-dimensional, and the acting is VERY average. (Nathan Fillion does a respectable job, but the rest of the ensemble I expect to be unemployed for a long time.) We are simply stunned at the response to this show. One reviewer hailed it as the \\"next Star Wars\\". What the ??!!? Not even close. Not even a light year away."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 of 4 DVDs would not play","review":"DVDs have some kind of problem as only 1 would play. Would love to watch as I enjoyed the series when on TV.

The DVD sales have been nothing short of miraculous and the feature film looks like it is going to be great. Fox has made some pretty bad decisions when canning shows. Here's hoping they'll pull a \\"Family Guy\\" and give the show another chance... if only to make the REAL money in DVD sales."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series...why did it have to go!?","review":"My wife and I both loved this series.

SHAME on Fox for cancelling the show after one season.The characters are what makes the show tick. They are typical of Joss Whedon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer). Very imperfect, flawed with a streak of humour that, as far as the characters in the story are concerned is not intended.If you get Firefly, follow it up later with the movie Sernity. It pulls together all the story threads left hanging at the end of Firefly.AUS"},{"rating":"2","title":"Firefly flies again!","review":"I've seen this series so many times, it feels like I know it by heart. Still, I bought Blu-Ray for simple convenience of having everything in one spot and in high-def.Short short desc of the show: Future. A band of mercenaries flies around in a ship that has a glowing b*tt (thus Firefly) and does stuff for money. Not always nice stuff, and that's your 1st clue that this series is different than usual good vs. bad kind of stuff we get on regular TV.Characters are beautifully created, with stories behind them that you can relate to (well, some of 'em). Story is always interesting and rarely you will look at the first few minutes and say \\"I know how this is going to end.\\". Main character is balancing between goody-goody and ne'er-do-well personality.Somebody already did a great job by doing a review of the series, so I'll keep it short and sweet: if you like UNIQUE and HUMOROUS stuff, here's the best deal you're going to get anytime soon! BUY IT! :D"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh!","review":"After seeing Serenity, realizing how incredibly fresh and original it was and then buying the season of episodes on which it was based was a good move...no, make that a great one. I never really got into Firefly while it was on TV; I just don't usually watch television due to the mind-numbing stupor today's shows tend to put me in. This blew me away. The series (and movie) is full of unknowns doing a very good job of acting, the script is...again...refreshingly original (both funny and somewhat intelligent...imagine that) and the special effects aren't too shabby...even accurate (e.g., no sound in space)! I highly recommend this product and the movie Serenity to anyone; being a Sci-Fi and/or Western fan need not be a requirement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not surprised it was cancelled after the first season","review":"I'm sure I will be flamed by raving fanboys, but this series is nothing special for me. Like others I bought this pack because of all the 5 star reviews making it out to be the best show ever made. Personally I think people are like that because it was cancelled early and they needed something to fill their voided nerd lives. (I'm a geek, so I understand) This was not a horrible show, some of the acting was good, but overall I found it boring and dragged out. Don't buy it unless you have seen some episodes already, and keep in mind the movie \\"Serenity\\" was the highlight of this story, the show was not as good. It would have been better to make a trilogy movie with a complete close to this story, there was no way this could have been kept interesting as a multi-year show. Sorry people, but that's the truth. Check out Babylon 5 for a good long series. ;-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Firefly, the series","review":"Started streaming this about 8 months ago, loved it. When I started watching it there wasn't any CC. Surprised to find that Amazon actually went back and encoded it with CC. Much better now, when you are almost deaf it's frustrating not knowing what the dialogue is. I bought the series DVDs, and they are great, but still stream now that CC has been enabled. Easier than messing with the DVD.Great series, superb acting.

The reviews seemed to be 50/50, half the reviews saying the Blu-Ray images blew the DVD out of the water, and the other half saying it didn't look any better. I took the plunge, sold the DVD's to relatives and bought the Blu-Ray discs. I have now watched the first four episodes on disc 1, and I can confidently say... I'm not sure.I was not really blown away by the difference in quality between the Blu-Ray version and watching the DVD's up-converted on my Blu-Ray player. I believe there are places, certain scenes, (maybe the outer space shots) where the Blu-Ray shines a bit more, but I am not overwhelmed. I am now wondering if the movie (Serenity) will be different. That will be next on my agenda.I still give the review 5 stars because this is an amazing fun show. Its premature cancellation was a tragedy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great syfy","review":"Fantastic movie. Watch Firefly series first as the movie will make more sense but is still great on it's own.

It is sad that there isn't more because I have developed an interest in the characters. You can tell that the director had a lot planned as so many ideas were set in motion. I can't give it 5 starts for two reasons: Firstly, The Blu-ray transfer wasn't that good. Lot's of noise. The opening battle scene in the first episode was terrible in terms of video noise. It made me feel that the whole series might be like that. Fortunately, it wasn't as bad but still not a clean transfer. Secondly, it's not appropriate for younger aged children due to adult themes (sexuality, violence and brief nudity). I realize that this was intended but I find this unfortunate because I believe this series could have had a broader reach which may have helped it to survive (or not - no one really knows)."},{"rating":"2","title":"I got the series on Bit Torrent","review":"I missed it originally, but like so many others, I am hooked.

This series has already become a cult classic and this box set is great for anyone who enjoys this sci-fi classic. The set isn't cluttered with large boxes and doesn't take up half my shelf. The show itself is just plain out fun with a fantastic cast.The show isn't about a totally optimistic future where everything turns out great. Instead the show tries to stick closer to what the future may very likely be.

It's not really a sci-fi series. It's a deep character focused drama/comedy. The setting just happens to be in the future where space travel is common.

You'll love all the characters differently, but you will love them."},{"rating":"2","title":"It could have been great...","review":"Finally being able to watch the pilot and episodes in order gives a tantalizing taste of what could have been a great show.

It's rare that mainstream networks have a clue what to do with good sci-fi or space opera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent, witty sci fi series","review":"This is only the second time I have taken time to review a product here, this series is that good. Well developed charachters, witty dialogue, good sets and many unexpected twists. This is not a show of epic battles but stories of a crew trying to survive within and outside the law. The stories are good if for no other reason then you do not know how things will turn out. By no means is it always the typical hollywood plot where the good guys always come out on top or your hero always does the right thing. If a little bit of western flare doesent hurt your sci fi experience you are doing yourself a disservice passing this up."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest Sci-Fi series EVER on TV","review":"Love this show.

The executives at Fox that cancelled this show obviously have no taste whatsoever and as Preacher once said a \\"special\\" afterlife location is waiting for them. The worst part about this set is the sadness that will come over you when you watch the last one knowing there are no more.This truly was the best science fiction series ever to grace television and not only had spectacular special effects (accurate no sound in space part), but splendid writing (injected with very real and witty humor) and fantastic acting (so comfortable in their characters it could have been season three) as well.

To my dismay, the show was cancelled 5 episodes later. Since purchasing the DVD set and watching the series in its entirety, I have concluded it is one of the most original, witty and intelligent shows produced. Many reviews will detail plots, characters, etc., so I will not try to copy what has already been said. What I will say is that every character is well written, well played and someone who will remain in your mind long after you have finished watching the show. There is not a bad episode in the bunch.

Buy the set - you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show","review":"I cannot fathom why Fox would have canceled this show, perhaps it was a bit ahead of it's time.

No. What I saw was an extremely clever take on technology; how some can afford it and some cannot. Look at our own world, you'll find some countries with high tech while other parts of the globe rely on much older technology. That was the Firefly vision, we're not one homogenous collective, all living at the same state of technology, we span a broad range.

I missed it when it was on but watched after seeing Serenity in the theatres. I don't watch many shows more than once but after multiple viewings this series consistently can put a lump in my throat and tears in my eyes or make me laugh out loud. Everyone that I have recommended this show to has thanked me after they watched it.

I am enjoying it to the fullest"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love. <3","review":"I have nothing to say that's not already been said, but I feel the need to shout my love for this series on the internet! I first picked this series up at the local library when I was in high school. I needed something to watch, and I had just finished Babylon 5. I was hooked on this series from the very first episode and quickly devoured all of them. I was so disappointed to learn that the series was no longer on the air. Firefly had the perfect blend of action, suspense, and perfectly-timed comedy. It's just a shame that most of my favorite series are short-lived sci-fi shows like Firefly, BSG, Dollhouse, SGU, etc.This world does not like forward-thinking or morally-ambiguous shows, which is why I think most of them don't last very long. At least we managed to coax a movie out of them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best show in a long time...","review":"I'm a huge fan of stories that are told right and told well. Firefly sets the standard for both and more. The show captivated me and it is a terrible shame that Fox decided it was better off without Firefly. I don't have time for TV, but I make time for Firefly. I am thrilled this show is on DVD and I hope, that by using my amazing powers of purchasing, I can help bring the show back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live fast, die young, leave a beautiful corpse. . .","review":"This is probably one of the best-done television shows I've ever seen. If you are a fan of science fiction, or if you are a fan of Wheedon's work (Buffy, Angel), you must buy and watch this series. Just be prepared for the heartbreak; this is all there is, the show was cancelled prematurely. Take heart that rumors of a movie currently abound.Even if you aren't normally a fan of science fiction, or westerns, or Joss Wheedon, you too will likely fall in love with this strange alchemy of compact writing, deft casting, and superb acting that has captured the attention of so many viewers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Firefly","review":"I just got the DVD box set for Christmas.What I like most about the series is it turns stereotypes on its head. One episode in particular made me start wincing and laughing. Mal was being tortured after several horrible scenes he somehow got loose. At the same time Serenity's crew was coming in for an impressive rescue. By the time Zoe and two others came in the torture chamber Mal was fighting with one of his torturers. Jayne was getting ready to shoot the person punching Mal when Zoe said this is something Mal should handle by himself. Mal hearing this puts Zoe straight by a simple \\"No, it isn't.\\"I love the way the show was serious and funny at the same time. As well as showing the more positive attributes of family and friendship. Since watching the show back to back for several hours I notice great many episodes show them at the table eating and enjoying one another's company (like family)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Firefly cancelled & Enterprise lives? No justice, No Taste!","review":"This was the best series to hit television in years, only to be cancelled by the bean counters at Fox who didn't even give it a chance (the same with Keen Eddie). The overwhelming praise here is testament to the idiocy of the networks. What is Fox up to now? THE SIMPLE LIFE!? If Paris Hilton in the new version of beauty, I envy the blind! If Universal indeed picked up the option for a movie, perhaps one of the networks will cancel ENTERPRISE and replace it with this jewel! NBC cancelled JAG and CBS picked it up and ran with it. It's happened before, it can happen again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best SiFi the world missed out on","review":"Much more than a western in space. The 9 characters on this show build relationships that are rarely seen in other sifi shows. After the 14th episode, you'll looking for more. Bonus features and comentary helps give you more details on the series, plot points, and fun of developing this series. You'll want to go see Serenity after this series. I found this series better than Enterprise and most of voyager. It's right up there with Farscape from my point of view."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's a bad review","review":"A few slots down, some guy gave this show 1 star. He said a scifi geek gave it to him. Notice that he then proceedes to recommend Star Trek!! Damn, what a geek that guy is. Star Trek has interesting plot lines? Yeah right! \\"Captain, the internal primary drive thrusters seem to be malfunctioning\\" \\"Hmm...I know! Convert the secondary power regulaters *through* the drive inversion cool, and run them into the drive thrusters!!\\" \\"Brilliant!!\\" Interesting my arse. Firefly actually show has charctors. What? A scifi show with charactors? Yes. Deep, flawed, interesting charactors, who interact with one another. The relationships between crew members are by far the most compelling aspect of Firefly.Anyways, buy it. Seriously. If you don't like it, I'll buy your DVD set off you. No joke.

The shows are great, good sound, widescreen (Fox never showed'm that way) and lots of the plot arc of makes sense (since Fox showed them out of order so things were very strange). The only complaint is the quality of the DVD Menus and such. The graphics just have a cheap feel and the selection 'bug' disapears into the background from time to time. Not a fatal flaw, but glaring compared to the quality of the shows.The missing espisodes explain alot too - why Irna was leaving at the begining of 'Objects in Space' (my fav) and more of Mal and Zoe's history.

This Blu-Ray package is the most complete collection of the series yet. The episodes are formatted in their original widescreen to play on modern TVs, and the menus look very slick in HD.My only small complaint is that there was no indicator of what episodes or features were present on what disk of the multi-disk set. This makes tracking down specific features a bit of a pain, but it's a small issue.If you want to own the best and most complete Firefly collection, this is the one. I also recommend purchasing Serenity on Blu-Ray of course."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This series was entirely too short lived.

But personally, I don't understand it. The story is mediocre, the camera work leaves a lot to be desired, and the acting was nowhere near the actors' ability.The first episode is available on Hulu right now. I would suggest watching it before buying to decide whether you'll actually like it.I don't expect many people who are actually looking for good information to actually see this, though... I'm sure tons of Firefly fans will have ranked this as unhelpful first..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another defective DVD from Amazon","review":"All three DVD's in this package have major defects.

There is no improvement in repurchasing Blu-rays.Of course, if you really want to see the horrible camera and lighting up close and personal, by all means, buy the Blu-rays.Not really the Blu-ray's fault.

It's a shame the show was cancelled.About the show itself, not only are the FX good - especially for a cable TV production - more importantly the characters are engaging and 'real'.

Watching the \\"extras\\" on the last disc reveals even more. Just imagine how good this would be without the constant tweaking demanded by the network pinheads at Fox! Joss Whedon tells about the changes the network was always pushing for with the show and despite his efforts to appease them, they cancel it anyway. How come all the good shows die young? About a decade ago, about the only show I would watch on TV was the wonderfully entertaining Brisco County, Jr. (also quickly cancelled by Fox). Like Firefly, it had stand alone episodes, but a steadily advancing plot with reoccurring characters, and was marvelous. So much of television, even with 500 channels, is assembly-line [...] So, what would you call 500 network executives at the bottom of the ocean? A good start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Firefly","review":"Currently deployed, and as many can guess entertainment on the little down time we get is highly prized.

After having been a fan of both other series' for many years, I should have trusted in Joss all along! ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series","review":"This is a great SF series. Basically it is a western (set in the far future in space), about down and outers, on the edge of society, just trying to survive with their honour intact.

It centers around the Firefly-class ship, Serenity. Most of the show has a sepia-tone filter to make it look aged and dusty. If you missed this one when it was first run, you have a second chance, and its worth it. There are three unaired episodes for those who did.

Go to Fox.com and look for an email drop-box.At LEAST they may finally realize that airing them out-of-order, and NOT airing the three BEST episodes was in fact, asinine. The pilot is actually pretty terrible (as most can be), but the evolution of the others is impeccable and even becomes a sheer masterpiece (as one might gather from these reviews).

This review is not about that. This review is about the absolutely terrible experience you will have with these Blurays. Not only are they slow to load but they don't remember your progress through episodes or allow you to access the disc menu while you are watching an episode. Seriously, there is no way to return to the menu without stopping playback. On a PS3 this forces you out of Bluray playback entirely and you must reload the disc, which is quite slow, to get back to the menu. Absurd. That there is no additional commentary and only a single 20 minute retrospective added to the Bluray beyond what came on the DVD set just adds insult to injury."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie is great, but Unbox is uncooked","review":"Movie got 2/3 through and just quit.

I had watched it since day 1, and thought it the best television show out there, and still do today. This is Joss at his best. The plot was a recreation of the \\"Wild West\\" and cowboy themes, yet with an original twist. I still wonder what the Alliance was doing, after it has been cancel for more than a year. For anyone who watched it during its short lifetime, loves its creators other show's (that's how i got hooked), or is just looking for a unique series, Firefly is that. The best part are the unaired episodes, which might be better than those showed and the special features, which give me a bit extra of the show I never stopped missing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never watched it on TV","review":"I never watched it when it was on TV since it was bounced around so much. I only just now started watching it when a friend lent me one of the DVDs. I am a big fan of Deep Space 9 and it has taken a long time to find a new show that has drawn me in as much as DS9 did.This show is a refreshing change to SciFi TV. Everytime I anticipate a Star Trek ending, I don't receive one- which is good. It makes the show harder to predict.Reasons I like the show so much:1. It has great character development, the actors seem to really synch well with each other, and their backstory is actually interesting.2. I have always enjoyed video games from the space privateer genre. This show depicts that just right. I wish more modern video games like Freelancer had more of this feel.3. I like the off-world sets. THey feel like something out of blade runner. Every environment seems to make you want to go out and explore it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best television series ever","review":"Firefly is a beautifully written show that I feel everyone should see. It has all the aspects of a great show and more. The main characters are played by great actors and are full of depth. I have never seen a better show, and after rewatching this on DVD I know that I never will. If only they would bring firefly back to television I would be the happiest girl alive."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing show","review":"I didn't discover Joss Whedon's TV work until last fall. I had seen the Buffy the Vampire Salyer movie a long time ago when it first came out, and while amusing, I didn't think it was very good at all. I started seeing Buffy every now and then on the f/x channel, and I became hooked. I have since seen all of the Buffy and Angel shows, and needing a fix, decided to throw $40 at the Firefly DVD set on the off-chance it might be good.Wow! What an amazing show. I watched the whole series and special features in two evenings (I would've watched it in one, but I had to go to work the next day). All I can say is that if you are looking for an entertaining and moving story with compelling characters, interesting stories, and Joss Whedon's trademark experimental perspectives, then you should buy this DVD set. You won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A real gem... shame they canceled it so prematurely !","review":"Also I have been a Amazon costumer for more than 5 years, this is the first time I'm reviewing a DVD bought here. Firefly itself was good enough as a reason.Thanks a lot to all the positive reviews that made me buy it!!:-)Being a fan of high quality scifi I have been looking for a touching, inspiring and at the same time action packed new concept for a pretty long time.Firefly is a real gem in this genre. It would a true waste not to develop this fascinating and genuine story concept any further.It's worth watching and buying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I HATE SCI-FI","review":"I hate sci-fi. I hate westerns. I hate \\"shoot-em-ups.\\" I love Firefly. I can't explain how the blending of all those things made up this show that i can't get enough of. Firefly gets under your skin. Wonderful cast, clever writers, and awesome special effects. Anyone who agrees with my first three statements will still agree with my fourth after viewing Firefly. Buy it, you won't be sorry.Go see the movie too. Serenity 9-30-2005"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great T.V. series.......Even better on DVD!!!","review":"I loved this program when it was on T.V. even though it was undeservedly short-lived. This DVD series is even better (no commercials) especially with the upcoming \\"Serenity\\" movie. Buying the complete series gave me a chance to re-fresh my memory. This is a must buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful","review":"Five hundred years from now, we have a crew of a star ship. They are not out to explore strange new worlds, not contact new civilizations. They are out to make a fast buck and are not finicky about legalities in doing so. Firefly was a kind of space western with situations and dialogue that were top notch. (Example: The Captain of the star ship retorts to one of his crew, \\"I'm pissed off and heavily armed, so why are we having this conversation?\\"(...)It was too bad that the network put the series in a bad time slot, showed the episodes out of order, and then cancelled the series before it could find an audience. It may turn out to be the biggest programming blunder since NBC cancelled the first Star Trek.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"Though I am not an avid fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and have not seen a minute of Angel, I do appreciate Joss Whedon's creative prowess. I must say that Firefly is by far the best TV show I have yet to see. I rarely watch TV and only found this DVD box set through message boards about the upcoming movie Serenity. In any case, this DVD set is definitely a must-have. Worth more than five stars, in my personal opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I am a Star Trek TNG, Babylon, DS9, Voyager, BSG diehard. Firefly is amazing. It's taken me this long to see the series and I wish that I had seen it back when it was actually relevant to try and save the series. Even though a lot of questions are left unanswered, the series is well worth watching especially the 'making of' clips at the end.Sometimes you watch a series or movie and you can see that the actors are having fun and enjoying working with each other and in the scene. Firefly is one of those shows and is absolutely awesome to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Set","review":"I upgraded from my DVD set to this one. Other reviewers have gone into the details, so I won't repeat anything here, suffice to say it's a great series. I would have liked to have seen more special features for the BD release, but you can't hope for much with a defunct series 10 years after the fact. The one thing that was missing, and it's a small thing, is just an episode list somewhere. One thing I liked about the DVD release was they had the episodes listed in series order and also the dates they were aired (totally out of order). That way you could clearly see how poorly handled this series was from FOX. It also let you know which episodes were on which disc. As it is with the BD release, know where does it say on any of the packaging or disc labels, which episodes are on which disc. It's a little thing, but I think it's important."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Favorite","review":"The Blu-ray itself plays well, and we have had no issues with it. As for the series, we love it. It's a quirky space western that combines the best parts of sci-fi with some great elements of old westerns. The story is engaging, funny, and exciting. I would recommend Firefly to people who like sci-fi standards like Star Trek. This series will keep you interested and laughing with the banter that occurs between characters. The banter is somewhat reminiscent of the the Whedon classic Buffy. Overall, a really fun series to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect experience","review":"The product was delivered in record time and in great condition. I am very pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best sci-fi ever!","review":"Get this dvd set. The plot, ship, locations, and characters are beyond wondeful. Anyone who enjoys sci-fi will love this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The brightest flames always burn out the fastest","review":"Firefly was one of the pinnacles of television for me. It was the product of group of people who truly believed in what they were doing. Great Writing, Great Directing, Great Acting...I look forward to any other avenues that this franchise might take... be it movies, books or anything. And I know that something will come becuse there is just to much unfinished.You can't take the sky from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series that ended too early.","review":"This was a great series with good personalities and a great storyline. It was unfortunate that it ended so soon. The quality of this Blu ray set is very good with great audio and picture and a good amount of extras. I would recomend this for any sci-fi fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"this land","review":"Awesome show, too bad it was canceled. But what I bought I got a for a great price and it is a very good show that will make you think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series, but I can't read.","review":"Good deal, was able to get this series for 25$ on sale. I had read that it comes with the serenity movie in addition to the episodes of the season, it doesn't appear to be the case. Again, I could be missing something and haven't looked much into it.either way, awesome series and you should check it out"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the best","review":"WHY did Fox cancel this show? It had SO MUCH potential! I watched the \\"Making of Firefly\\" on the DVD last night, and I could tell that Joss was frustrated with the Fox upper brass from the start.Fair warning for anyone who purchases this DVD: It will leave you wanting more. I've also seen the movie (was lucky enough to get into a sneak preview) and, while the movie was great, it was different from the series. The series was all about character development and making you fall in love with the crew (which Fox so irresponsibly denied us the chance of fulfillment). The movie is more plot-driven. So, while I loved the movie, I sincerely hope that the result is MORE EPISODES!Enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show","review":"The network sure missed it when they canceled this show.It is original, great acting, great script.I wonder sometimes who exactly is running things on TV, they cancel great shows at a drop of a hat and keep crap on that is not worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Firefly and Serenity","review":"If you like clever, thoughtful and (a little) campy Sci-Fi; this is a great series for you. Science fiction with a Western flavor. I would not recommend it for children. You should review yourself because of some themes and off-screen actions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent show","review":"I wish they had not cancelled this show. The first season was excellent and showed a lot of promise for the future. Oh well...."},{"rating":"2","title":"FIREFLY- THE COMPLETE SERIES","review":"Loved the show and was mad as all get out when they took it off the air. Nathan Fillion, is one of my favorite actors. I would like to see him back on the tv again and I would also like to see this complete set available on VHS also."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was too late:(","review":"This is one of the best series I have ever seen, but I feel like too many people got on the boat too late. Of course, FOX made a big mistake when it put Firefly on Friday nights and a worse mistake when it stopped airing the series. I wish there was another season or two where they show the independence war or at least more about it. Great show, great concept, and a great ship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Battlestar Galactica meets Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid","review":"During its brief stint on broadcast TV, I managed to catch only a few episodes of Firefly, but I never really got into it. Probably because, like many of the best TV dramas, Firefly is a highly linear show. If you skip episodes or watch them out of order, you just don't get it. But I had heard from friends that the show was good, so I decided to buy it, and it did not disappoint. Once you start watching, it's hard to put the discs down. And make sure to watch Serenity when you're done with the season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorram Perfect!","review":"\\"Firefly\\" is nothing short of incredible! Great cast, great dialog, and amazing stories. There is not a single bad episode in the entire series; in fact, I can not think of a show in recent memory that has had this much charm.What amazes me more than anything else is the chemistry that this cast has with one another! I can not recommend this box set more highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the DVDs","review":"It does not differ appreciably from watching the DVDs with decent upscaling (say, a PS3). If anything it looked a bit worse, because the graininess is now \\"sharper\\". Buy the DVDs, they're equivalent, and much cheaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift was received","review":"Sent to my son as a gift. He did receive it and I haven't heard anything else, so I imagine that it was good to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic series","review":"Firefly is an amazing and beautiful series, my boyfriend wanted the blu-ray version for his HD tv, but I'd recommend just getting the regular dvds since I didn't notice a difference in quality at all. It's a tv show, not shot in HD, so it's not really worth the extra money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peerless Television","review":"Many shows are humorous, many shows are sad, many shows have action, and a few look really really good. Firefly was all of these things. This DVD set includes all 12 aired episodes plus 3 unaired, along with commentary, a gag reel, and more. Having seen most of the material involved I can safely give the source material 5 stars. For the presentation and implementation of menus and effects, I remain hopeful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Thing to Hit Television. Ever.","review":"When it was first aired, I stumbled across an episode of Firefly. Within seconds I was mesmerized. I kept wondering, \\"What is this show? Why have I never heard of it?\\" Since then, I've seen every episode on the DVD set at least twice. They're phenomenal. They feel more like short movies than t.v. episodes. They stand up to many viewings. Every time I watch, I notice something clever that I hadn't seen before. The DVDs are a wonderful way to have these shows at my fingertips. The commentaries are funny and enlightening. The special features are a delight. What a bargain!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Firefly Rocks!","review":"Firefly was an awesome TV Show! I love my collection :)We watch it over & over! Hate that it was cancelled :(But with the movie and the complete collection, we canenjoy the laughter & action forever! Classic in Sci-Fi!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Firefly - damn good!","review":"I watched the movie first and honestly didn't know anything about Firefly other than I would occasionally here about Janes Hat or someone being a Brown Coat. Not that I had a clue what it was all about.After the movie I decided I had to see what the series was about and I have to say that it is really saying something when I sit in front of the TV, as I'm notoriously picky and more to the point, busy - I might manage about 4 hours of television a month if I'm lucky. That said, I sat down over the course of a week and watched all of these, and feel that this is possibly one of the best series that was ever on television and I can't possibly understand why they would cancel it.Serious oversight on someones part and hopefully they lost their job over that decision!It's a good series, my wife and kids liked it, safe for the family, plenty of humor and action and it was killed way before its time.Buy it, get it, love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show, FOX didn't know what they had","review":"I love this show and it's a damn shame FOX canceled it. I do, however, think I know why many people couldn't get into it.This show came out close to year after 9/11. Overall the show was about \\"Fighting the Establishment\\", unfortunately it came out during a time where people needed the \\"Establishment\\" for comfort and most importantly, some answers.I guarantee you that if this show was to premiere today, it would have an unbelievable fan base the likes of \\"Lost\\" or \\"American Idol\\".I give this show a 10/10 hands down."},{"rating":"2","title":"How did I miss this completely in 2003?","review":"How did I miss this completely in 2003?If the movie hadn't come to cable, and I hadn't been surfing channels one day, I would have never found this gem. At first I wasn't sure it was going to work... guns... space... western... however, it did. I found myself wanting more. I bought the box set and watched the whole thing in three days. Now, I'm still left wanting more.... Definately worth the purchase in my book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another brilliant but canceled series.","review":"This is an awesome show. I watched 2 episodes at a friends house, and the very next day I ordered both the series and movie. It has great writing, intriguing characters who actually develop depth and personality as the show goes on. If you like Sci-Fi but your looking for a bit of a twist on the same old thing, this you should definetly consider. If you saw the movie \\"Serenity\\", you cannot judge this show by the movie spin off...the show is 10x better and if you give it a chance, you will definetly see that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Great packing. Great movie. We love it so much. Thanks for the hard work put in to packing the time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series is an understatement!","review":"I for one do not watch any tv. When I saw the movie Serenity, I immediately loved the well developed characters, the settings, the story. Its been years where an ensemble cast is so likable literally. A friend actually informed me that this was based on a tv series. I immediately bought this dvd set and watched the whole thing incidentally in a matter of three days. It was excellant. I also learned that that this show was cancelled. I would say this is almost a tragedy because there is so much utter crap on tv that to have a show of this caliber cancelled is tragedy. I wish Sci-Fi or for that matter any company would pick up and restart this show. Please!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Firefly - My Heart of Gold","review":"I watched this on Fridays when FOX first aired it. I rented the whole series from NETFLIX. I have asked for the DVD box set for Christmas. FOX should of shown them in the order that the DVD's are in it would have made more sense. The unaired episodes are some of the best. \\"Heart of Gold\\" is my favorite. Please buy these. Go see the movie \\"Serenity\\" and buy the DVD on December 20, 2005. Can't Take my sky from me...I found Serenity"},{"rating":"2","title":"Short lived glory","review":"I got into Firefly when it came on TV. I was eager every week for the episodes, but with all of FOX's \\"other priorities,\\" I ended up being more confused than anything. I didn't even know that it was pulled off the air until I read it somewhere, a month after the fact.This DVD is everything I expected. It's great to see all the episodes without commercial breaks, and in order! The story is great, with many undercurrents and character developments. The DVD with all the extras was fun to watch also. I would definetly recommend this DVD series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New Firefly Fan","review":"Firefly was recommend to us as a great series. When we saw the whole year on sale at a great price, we purchased it. Firefly didn't disappoint and when we saw the movie \\"Serenity\\", now we can't wait for it to come out on DVD!It is dissapointing that the FOX network didn't take this show more seriously when it first aired. According to the DVD, the shows were aired all out of order. BUT then who takes us SCI-FI fans seriously?If you are a SCI-FI/Western fan, you will love Firefly and Serenity!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Hardly Knew Ya","review":"I never watched Firefly during its short TV run, but after watching the movie I got the bug for the series and lo and behold, Firefly is/was flat out good! The comaraderie is there, the Whedon witty reparte, and timing, are carried over from Buffy and (especially) Angel, and I am left wishing for more. The DVDs give me a chance to watch them as they should have been broadcast (makes much more sense by the way) and I again marvel that the guys making broadcast decisions at the networks can make it to work with their pants on. In one word -- MORONS - thats right cancel Firefly but make sure you leave Elimidate on, don't want to lose that trailer park, sometimes sober, always in-bred segment of the audience!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent series and movie","review":"We greatly enjoyed this series! After seeing the movie in the theatre, my husband and I decided to check out the series on DVD. This is top-rate entertainment, and as far as we are concerned, this should never have been cancelled. We pray for the day that this series is brought back or a sequel to the movie made. Till then we will watch our Serenity movie and Firefly series DVD over and over. Fabulous!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sadly short lived","review":"Combining classic sci-fi elements with a touch of the western, Joss Whedon's Firefly was a sadly short lived show which Fox had the brilliant idea of cancelling before the season was even over. Firefly's story revolves around the crew of the Serenity five hundred years into the future as they partake different mercenary jobs while on the run from the Alliance and other deadly forces. Just like Whedon's other hit shows Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel, Firefly contained plenty of smarts and humor but also managed to keep the viewer riveted from beginning to end. Rumor has it that Whedon is busy at making a Firefly film, which will be a must see for the show's surprising amount of dedicated followers. All in all, if you missed out on Firefly when it was on TV, check out this series now that it's on DVD; you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It also comes in spanish.

I've seen it 100 times but still I miss lines and see new things in the background. I don't know were Joss Whedon came up with some of the lines but they are hilarious and very rememorable.Great show and worth 5 stars no doubt. I don't use the Blu Ray stuff but looks great in HD.If you haven't seen this yet and can pick up the season for 20 bucks or less like I did you'll get your money's worth.You know what else is funny is this is one of the few Sci-Fi shows I can get my wife to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Show, Pretty Good Blu-Ray","review":"You already know that this is one of the most awesome, unique shows ever made. The blu-ray picture quality is far superior to DVD, but not as razor-sharp as other blu-ray releases, like, say Serenity. There is a noticeable distinction between shots without special effects and those with. All of the CGI seem to be created in standard definition. The sound quality, featuring DTS, is superb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Firefly the Great","review":"This a great series especially for scifi buffs.

This is a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still not tired of it.","review":"When this show was first aired I was there, every night. I watched and taped every airing. I wore out those tapes due to Firefly's untimely demise, but was thrilled, in a bittersweet way, to learn of it's coming to DVD. I've watched the series countless times, and I enjoy it more and more with each viewing. The acting is phenomenal. The direction is on par with, and often better than, full length feature films. The writing is peerless. I love this DVD set and I would trade it for nothing except a machine that can transport me to an alternate reality where poo flinging FOX executives didn't cancel this brilliant, BRILLIANT show."},{"rating":"1","title":"did not receive","review":"the company was out of stock and was going to be delayed further and I needed to cancel the item and will repurchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as I expected - good quality","review":"The jersey came right on time for Christmas and my son loved it.

Ponderous was very comical yet stimulating to the mind as well, and She was just an all out great story. I then a few years later went looking for the full album, which I finally found the cassette in about 1995. The entire tape was great, with a ecclectic mix of story and instrumentation that not only sounded good, it was stimulating as well. I am now searching for the CD version as well as anything else they produced.I have since this review purchased the CD of Ponderous, but have also found their second CD entitled \\"2Nu2\\" and it is as equally amazing as the first.

I've read at least 30 of them over the years. They all contain information on subjects I care nothing about, including this one.

A good quarter of the facts presented are debatable, apocryphal, or just plain wrong. Many are tired old chestnuts that have been repeatedly documented and debunked on web sites such as [...] or Wikipedia. And there is the crux of it: if this book were published in 1996 the authors could be excused for presenting tall tales and urban legends as facts. But it was published in 2006, by which time anyone with a brain, a web browser, and a modicum of initiative could and should do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the point?","review":"A lot of what is cited in this book as fact is little more than idiocy.

That makes me feel less bad about burning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What good is a book of facts if the \\"facts\\" are false.","review":"I stopped reading when I came across the story that says the word \\"newspaper\\" comes from when the telegraph was invented; newspapers added a section with stories from the North, East, West, and South (N.E.W.S.). Oh really? Shakespeare used the word \\"news\\" 316 times in his plays and the telegraph wasn't invented yet.

There are other strange things, such as Mongols being wiped out by a \\"hurricane\\" while invading Japan. Really? What were they doing on the Atlantic Ocean?The problem, of course, is all of the interesting things become less interesting when they only \\"might\\" be true."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow does this have a lot of mistakes!","review":"Just like other reviewers here - I was really enjoying this book until I started coming across blatant errors. I was just skimming through the book and saw that Popeye was created in 1919 - me being a huge fan and somewhat of an historian on cartoons knew right off the bat he was created in 1929. Also on the subject of cartoons - the voice of Bugs Bunny, Mel Blanc, was NOT allergic to carrots. These are 2 facts just a few paragraphs from each other that I recognized as false. Upon further reading I began to realize this book should not make the claim that it contains useless knowledge, but rather that it contains stories the author once heard that might be partially true. If this is a best seller then I should have a crack at writing one of these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy and Superficial","review":"There were numerous outright errors in this book, and much of the rest was unimpressive.

The format of this book is basically just several one or two sentence \\"facts\\" per page with no sources to back it up. It's fine for entertainment value, but I wouldn't necessarily believe it all. I wonder how much of it is just \\"urban legend\\" repeated. For example, the origin of the \\"F-word\\" is explained as an abbreviation of \\"Found Under Carnal Knowledge.\\" After doing an internet search, I found that this is just one version of several abbreviations that are considered to be urban legends by entymologists.If you're looking for \\"useless\\" trivia, I would recommend the Imponderables books by David Feldman. He takes questions from readers and researches them thoroughly, using and quoting multiple sources, so you can discuss it with your friends later without looking like an idiot.

I mean, five disks ought to contain something of some interest, right? Forget it. Buying this set was a major mistake. The interviews (apart from those with Mick Taylor and Anita Pallenburg) were amateurish; the footage was nothing to write home about; and, there was no Stones music whatsoever -just this irritating, bush-league, Keef-like riff (actually, there were two riffs, designed to sound like Honky Tonk Women and Brown Sugar) inserted at \\"opportune\\" moments (like when the band was playing). Forty clams down the drain. Hopefully, a used CD store will take it off my hands at a 75% haircut."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO MUSIC ???? Terrible, Terrible release","review":"I can't believe how bad this set is. The entire 5 disc set doesn't contain a single note played or sung by the Rolling Stones. The set also claims to be seven hours and it is less than five.Interviews with the Rolling Stones are few and far between and all come from secondary sources.Most of the footage is reused in every disc and the most annoying thing is the CONSTANT STONES IMITATION BACKGROUND MUSIC THAT PLAYS THE ENTIRE TIME.Many extremely boring and unessential interviews the only one of ANY consequence (barely) is Mick Taylor and he quit the band thrity years ago. All the others are former engineers, back up singers and LOTS and LOTS (and LOTS!) of interviews with biographers, and writers NO ONE HAS EVER HEARD OF!I hate this kind of release, A complete waste of my time and money.

I thought even though it was unathorized there would be some revelations - gossip even. But this is ... in the extreme. Nothing new here or original, and guess what - NO STONES MUSIC PERIOD. Who thought of producing a set on the greatest band in the world without the kick ... music included?? To make matters worse, some jerk thought it would be cool to get a guitar player to mimic Keef's classic riffs throughout - BAD IDEA. This box must have taken a day to throw together. Okay, so maybe getting hold of the guys would be tough, but why not get together some of the bands who have fallen under the spell of the Stones - GnR's, Aerosmith, Nugent, to name a few. Save your money and buy the recent remasters . If my friend hadn't warned be off, I'd be real ... now - nearly 50 bucks!!! GIVE ME A BREAK. There should be a law aginst putting stuff like this out ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good!","review":"This collection is truly an amateur effort at putting together a retrospective look at the entire Stones history.

Don't bother with this one unless you collect everything Stones."},{"rating":"1","title":"No music at all","review":"This is not a music video - it is everything but ... As a documentary film which misses the product of the people whose life it is documenting, it is acceptable. If you want their music, don't buy it.The authors had no rights to the music and had no cooperation from the Rolling Stones and it shows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stones left unturned","review":"Don't know why other Stones fans have given this shoddy history five stars. There's not a note of Stones music in the entire unauthorised documentary, a pretty essential ingredient that's entirely missing. Clearly the makers couldn't afford or weren't granted the rights to the Jagger/Richards catalogue. Some of the footage looks interesting (e.g. from Keith's basement during the \\"Exile\\" sessions), but the fact that it's silent kills it. Some okay interviews, mostly with peripheral people but a few with central players (Mick Taylor, Billy Preston, Anita Pallenberg), but it's not enough to make up for the cliche-ridden narration and lack of Keef riffs! The Stones deserve their own Anthology series, not this kind of lacklustre effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rolling Stones...","review":"Hey- Don't Know if this DVD Set rates One Star.

The author is a bit more sympathetic towards Marshal Bazaine than some other writers, without in any way minimising his responsibility for the catastrophe that France suffered in 1870, and more critical than many on von Moltke. After reading this book one begins to see just why the French were so aggressive in their battle tactics in 1914, with the tragic results that shaped much of 20th century French history. This book should be read alongside the excellent books by Howard and Wawro on the Franco-Prussian War."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate Bratz","review":"In the past few months my little 6-year-old sister has enjoyed playing with bratz dolls.

(Not interested in the \\"cute\\" M&D; figures, likes the plastic models mentioned by others) And, while most of his \\"guys\\" don't fit in the dungeon, this was an immediate hit.

This castle and about half a dozen of the knight and princess sets from playmobil have been hours of entertainment for them. So far the castle has held up well and I hope that it will make it through my children to save for my grand children.I would have to say that the only cons I can think are: there is only 1 hiding place, and the wood is unfinished.

Velcro still holds well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough elbow support","review":"I assumed this at first but thought I'd try them anyway. Because they are adjustable, they provide little support at the elbow. I purchased them to support my elbows during workouts. No matter how tight you make them, the elbow elastic does not support the elbow. The opening at the antecubital space (you can't see it in the picture because her elbow is not extended) causes pinching in that same area."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Item.

I would get the soreness in the elbow area, some clicking and pain with lateral types of movement. This brace is not very effective. What I found helped a lot was braces / supports which are specifically for tennis elbow versus something like this product which had generic support claims."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good brace","review":"I bought this to help recover from tendonitis in my elbow. I play a lot of sand volleyball and I must have hyper extended it at some point. I was having a hard time recovering because I use it so much that I kept inflaming it. I bought this brace which I used only when playing volleyball. It helped my elbow feel a lot more stable. It didn't correct the issue completely, but I felt that when I wore this, my elbow didn't get worse. I began doing rehab with weights to strengthen the ligaments and over time, the issue went away. My only negative issue with the brace was that the gap at the elbow joint along the seams is abrasive and after playing a few matches, my inner elbow region would be pretty raw where the brace was rubbing. The Velcro is very strong and the brace stays in place. I just threw it in the washer after each use and it has held up really well. Overall it is a quality product that I would buy again or recommend to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good product","review":"I have been wearing this product on both elbows for weight lifting and MMA practices. I has decreased my symptoms and allowed me to perform better substantially. I also have less pain after the practices.I am 43 y/o, and I have had problems with my elbows since I was 16, so I have had many other elbow supports.

After a month off, and with the assistance of this brace, I'm back to taking classes, albeit on a limited basis. A great start though! This brace was so helpful - really took pressure off the tendons by providing support. It's easy to put on, independently. It does get a bit warm during a workout though - after about 45 minutes I had to take it off to air out a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grammar in spoonfuls","review":"Being an English teacher, grammar is not easy to convince most students to accept.

Before seeing them, the only song I had heard from them was \\"Resurrection\\" from this album, and I really liked it. Once I heard them play their set I was blown away and immediately went to the booths to pick up this CD (and a shirt).After my first listen through of the album, I am eager to play it again and again. Aside from the self-titled track I am already addicted to, my next favorite would possibly be \\"Pleasure In Pain\\" for the dynamic range of vocals and brilliant guitar work.Buy the CD and wear it OUT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Work","review":"Chimaira has yet written another great album. I think this is their most diverse album yet. It doesn't have the epic 5 minute tracks that their self-titled had (even though it has the 9 minute long \\"Six\\"), but it's satisfying enough. Mark Hunter still stands out as a vocalist, and Andols has some great drumming. Oh, and the keyboards are used more, creating more of an atmosphere. Opener track \\"Resurrection\\" has a wicked guitar solo thrown in, and tracks like \\"Pleasure In Pain\\" and \\"The Flame\\" have some mad riffs.This is yet another solid and original release from a band that stands out well amongst its peers. This CD has diversity, intensity, and wicked talent.

The album \\"Chimaira\\" was pretty good had a few songs I liked but nothing really stuck out to me like how the other cds did.

The dvd is worth getting I wont say to much s**t about it but it's worth it. This cd is just amazing I love it. If you are a Chimaira fan then check this out and if you didn't like there last album \\"Chimaira\\" still check this out. I didn't care for that album but this album is great.I give the cd a 4/5and the dvd 5/5 so i just made it 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"underrated","review":"I think this is one of the cult classic shows thats underrated and only known to those people who are old enough to remember it. As for the reasons this is why....there are probably too many from the fact that it ran for only a season to William Shatner retaining rights or whatever. I'm glad this came out, but unfortunately i'm not buying it and i'll tell you why. This series is only worth watching if you've seen the TV movies that aired before the series got picked up. Like the Kevin Sorbo Hercules TV movies that came first THEN the series. They should include EVERYTHING! otherwise It would be unfair to the fans. Hearing a backstory during a series especially like this one is NOT good enough.

First: did Glen get an answer? How can you call a release complete series if the first 4 episodes are missing? Second is there absolutely no truth in advertising? As much as I was looking forward to this release and enjoyed the show WTF? I give the DVD makers and the Networks a one star for a half a**ed effort at a good program. Oh Bill and Greg and you others, the writers, Tech peeps; I give you folks 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHERE ARE THE TV MOVES!!","review":"When I picked up the Canadian release years Age I was so happy that it came out,And now with this release i really thought they where going to include the TV Moves with it. I was wrong! The Only way to get the movies right now is to find the VHS taps (SUPPER! hard to find). If you have A VHS and can get your hands on the tapes I recommend waching them before you buy this release. The Series builds so much on the movies that it is A required prerequisite. So If you want to buy it go ahead but i recommend waching the movies first."},{"rating":"2","title":"TekWar series -- 2nd year","review":"I loved this series when it first aired.

He moved out of that idiom after his star was somewhat faded, and he then recorded his best music. These are not included in his \\"Greatest Hits\\" material, which is reissued ad nauseum. Like most of Campbell's recordings, there is a range to please a variety of tastes, but in this case my favorites are Old Home Town (with is non-hick Country, non-saccharine nostalgia) and Mull of Kintyre (which isn't on \\"Greatest Hits\\" but should be on \\"best of\\" list, at least if I drew up the list). For those tired of repackaging of the same top 12 over and over, his best stuff is elsewhere, and here are at least a couple of them.

But I wouldn't go out of my way to hear them. On several tracks, Bokar uses this plucking, popping sound like the pizzicato on a violin (I can't tell whether he does it on the strings or with the electronics). This effect is fine for a few bars but used for a whole track it sounds like one of those cloying coffee percolating commercials from the 60s. The vocals, again, would be OK in the relaxed expectations of a lounge, but on the CD they sound like the lungless singing of Chet Baker (though not that morbid). There are a few tracks that actually swing, but not enough to redeem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost classic?","review":"Great mixtape from Ras Kass.. all words have been said. so im'a just put in order what i thouhgt:Production: 8/10Lyrics: 10/10Flow: 9/10Overall: 9 / 10"},{"rating":"2","title":"re - up","review":"this is a great mix - tape cd , good beats and production . only thing i did'nt like was a comment by ras kass on it saying kill the white people ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its dope!","review":"Ras lyrically represents (like usual) but you have to see this for what it is-- a compilation record.

They installed it at the entryway to the burrow along with mothballs and dirt to cover the entry. After just three days, guess what happened? The groundhog actually moved the repeller about a foot away from his burrow's entrance, spewed the mothballs around and moved the dirt away. The groundhog is now happily going about his life as usual with the repeller beeping incessantly a foot from his burrow's entry. Perhaps this groundhog has hearing problems? Perhaps this repeller doesn't work for this particular species of burrowing rodent?

This is one of those that will stick with you, long after the credits have passed.Marquis de Sade is locked away in an insane asylum, run by a well intentioned, but somewhat insecure priest, who allows Marquis to \\"expel the demons in his head\\" through his writings. Things then become interesting, as his writings are smuggled out of the asylum, and spread throughout France. These sexually graphic writings fall into Napolean's hands, and he is outraged, and sends in \\"the doctor\\" to attempt to silence the Marquis.I will say no more, other than that this is a powerful tale, with heavy emphasis on the characters, the clashing of their ideals, hypocricy, censorship and SEX.The acting is phenomonal, the scenery, directing...it all adds up to a real treat of a film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quills, The Movie","review":"Quills is an excellent movie about the marquis de sade.

Got your attention Geoffrey Rush should have won an Oscar for his portrayal of the Marquee. This movie is not for the squeemish. It is Raw and to the point. For a fun drinking game take a drink everytime there is a sexual enuendo. This movie deals heavily with freedom of speech, and sexual expression. No it's not porn. This has plot and little sex. Except for the dead body thing. Winslet and Phoenix also do well as a handmaiden and preacher in the asylum. Michael Caine also plays a pivotal role and also deserves and oscar worthy performance. The clothing, backgrounds, and scenery is just wonderful. the imagery is overpowering. The movie is just brilliance, you would think it was a foreign film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quill Me","review":"This was an interesting view, and I was fascinated by the story line, but it's a downer, so \\"warning.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Utterly Lucious","review":"This movie is wonderful! The acting, the script, the story, the drama, the tension and resolution are all perfect. Great humor and horror mixed fantastically together. Plus Kate Winslet is gorgeous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the faint of heart (or kids)","review":"Quite a tale. It's based on the imprisonment of the Marquis de Sade. I have no idea how much of this is based in fact. But from what little I know of the Marquis, none of it would surprise me. The acting is excellent. The scenery and costumes are spectacular. Well worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where do your darkest fantasies lie?","review":"This is a remarkably good movie around the historical charactor Marquis De Sade. Unknown to many people this is no fictional charactor. Rush does an amazing job protraying the keeness of the deep charactoristics invovled in such a role. The disturbingly erotic senses invoked in this chilling production really make you think if you don't get deep into the movie you may just get disgusted instead of intreagued. I would recommend this movie to a select group who may truely appriciate this masterpiece, but it's something everyone should see someday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good!","review":"This is the worst movie I've seen in a long time. Motivations behind the characters' actions were lacking (dare I say nonexistent?). The plot line really didn't make any sense. I can only imagine that the actors were embarrassed after seeing the final version. Good points: scenery, costumes, backdrops (or whatever they're called); acting (Winslet, even though she wasn't given any reason to do the things she was doing, and Joachim (sp?), wow; I think Michael Caine was laughing through his lines). Gotta go, I have kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick of Quills","review":"Beginning with the French Revolution and bloody beheadings, this movie sickens the viewer from start to finish. Kate Winslet shines as the virginal laundress who DIES for Sade's scandalous prose. Geoffrey Rush is brilliant as Marquis de Sade who is imprisoned in France's Charenton asylum- and begins a vile descent into madness --deprived of quill and ink, writing with wine, blood and even poop! His sexual fantasies make today's smuttiest romance novels look like fairy tales. His work is in defense against the repression and hypocrisy of his society, but can we feel sorry for a writer who embraces freedom of expression with his own hypocrisy? It makes one relieved that this movie was adapted by Doug Wright from his own stage play and is a work of fiction. Beware: Too much blood and nudity!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Quills\\" just doesn't hit the target","review":"Oh my. \\"Quills\\" is one of those movies you buy on a leap of faith because of all the Academy Award nominations and great actors. Then, (and you know how fickle the Academy Awards nominations can be) you ask yourself \\"Why?\\" The cast is terrific! Geoffrey Rush (Shine, Shakespear in Love and Mystery Men), Kate Winslet (Titanic), Joaquin Phoenix (Gladiator) and the great Michael Caine (The Cider House Rules) do their best to get the viewer interested but even they can only do so much. There is nothing in Quills. It's banal, boring, not credible and a general disappointment. If you want to find out about the Marquis de Sade watch the A & E Channel's Biography on him and pick up one of his works. They are still printed. Chances are you'll start to rewind the movie before it's halfway through like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perversely interesting and little plot, thats about it.","review":"I won't explain the entire plot, since it has been done in enough reviews. I will say that I thought this movie was original, well acted, and perversely interesting. That is all I can say that is good.Watching this movie, makes the viewer feel like a voyeur. Watching things you feel you shouldn't. Wanting to turn it off, and do something else, but not able to. Even that is not bad.My problem was, there was little to no plot. I felt like the director put the actors in front of the cameras, with a few pages of lines and told them to improvise the rest. There wasn't anything to follow. The scripting was terrible.For such an interesting historical topic, it should have been done much better.Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quills = disgusting scenes to turn your stomach.","review":"Yes, it is another well crafted, well acted and well done movie, but with such sadistic scenes to leave one thoroughly disturbed, upset and utterly sad. Yuck! It is so easy to use scenes of torture and the degrading of the human spirit (in this case of the Marquis de Sade) so as to make a movie seem profound. The film begins with a bloody beheading and I personally left near the end when a mentally deficient inmate was put in a small cage to be tortured. You know, folks, it takes greater skill and creativity to make a point with out the viewers all having to go through hell to \\"get it\\". This movie, in its savoring of revolting violence, is in itself a sadistic act."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kaufman should have studied history first","review":"Not only this movie is absolutely inaccurate about historical facts, Sade's real life and date of death, life in asylums in Napoleon's time, but also the plot vanishes, it seems quite lost, almost unbelievable. In brief, it's the second movie of this year (Quills and Unbreakable), where the chance to tell an excellent story is lost due to this kinf of problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This is the kind of movie that stays with you long after its' been viewed. The acting is so incredible, (with my favorite being Joaquin Phoenix as the well-meaning but tortured young priest). The set design is so detailed and perfect. The screenplay is funny and sexy and disturbing all at once.Don't expect a documentary. It's meant for entertainment, while still getting the message (several, in fact) across.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a great period piece.","review":"I gave this movie 4 stars for the simple fact that the costuming, dialogue, and plot were maginificent. Kate Winslet and Geoffrey Rush were fabulous, but Joaquin Phoenix stole the show. His intense portrayal of the Abbe was so moving and so heartfelt. His love for Madeleine was so powerful. Rush, as the Marquis de Sade, was often funny at times. All in all, this is a must see for fans of this historical period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasing","review":"This movie was very good. A bit odd and very sexual. The characters were fantastic however. The story was good and it's wierdness kept you intriguedj. If you do not mind oddities and are open minded you will probably love this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABYSMAL, FRAUDULENT","review":"I'm not a stickler for historical accuracy in movies, but Quills is outrageous in its misrepresentation of its subject, the Marquis DeSade; for a movie that is ostensibly about the limits of free expression, director/writer Phil kaufmann commits the unpardonable crime of substituting his own words for DeSades when the author's works are quoted on screen. When bits of \\"Justine\\" or \\"Juliette\\" are read, we hear innocuous, harmless erotica reminiscent of Jon Lovitz's \\"Tales of Ribaldry\\" skit from Saturday Night Live. DeSade's works are like the diaries of a serial killer -- designed to test limits and make us uncomfortable. Read aloud in a movie, the MPAA would slap the film with a NC-17. Kaufmann turns DeSade into an 18th century Russ Meyer -- harmless. The movie is utterly pointless, the work of a coward unwilling to face up to the true implications of his subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Subject matter too narrow","review":"Sadly disappointed, I hoped to learn about the society which cultivated the Marquis's writings. Instead, I watched a justification of why it's OK to like porn (because you can be a better person once you purge yourself). The worst part: I actually was so grossed out by the gore and blood, that Speed and Die Hard actually constitute a more romantic, hotter date flick. A waste of the brilliant talent that graced each frame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quills Ryhmes with Swill","review":"When I read the Amazon review I did not get any idea of what this movie was really about. It is the absolute worst movie I have ever seen. The narrative was poor, the dialogue tasteless, the setting grim, and the characters unbelievable. Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AAAAAAAAH!!!!!!!!!","review":"We rented this movie one Friday night... We had decided to look for something amusing, but not something scary or disturbing... Walking past Schindler's List and other favorites of ours, we picked up Quills and settled down with our bag of cookies for what we had expected to be a serious, yet farcical drama.NO SUCH LUCK.We ended up spending our night hiding behind each other wimpering.If your prepared for rape, torture, violence, blood, horrifying psychology, and traumatic sights, this could be a very good film for you.If you're not prepared for that, RUN AWAY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and sexy.","review":"A sexy period piece. I'm not a big fan of Shakespearean artsy movies with guys in tights, but this was very funny and sexy. The Marquis De sade, what a great idea for a film. Kate Winslet was delicious as was Geoffrey Rush. He was perfectly cast to play the Marquis de Sade. I Was pleasantly surprised to see Michael Cane as the good doctor. The surprise performance was from Joaquin Phoenix. He is turning in to a real actor.

Well acted by Rush, Winslet, Phoenix, and Caine. Some parts are really twisted and sick, but the desperation comes out in DeSade, as his obsession to write eroticism and also in Phoenix, trying to keep a hold on his status as a \\"Man of God\\". You'll enjoy the writings of the Marquis DeSade and be interested in the history of how they were published at that time and be in utter awe of the contents. Don't let the kiddies watch this! Lock the movie up if you buy it or rent it. Keep it for yourself and watch it with a loved one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie","review":"This was an incredibly enjoyable movie. It had a developed, yet easy to follow storyline, and the characters all had depth. The 18th century insane asluym setting was both haunting, and sureal.

No stranger to writing, she also wrote American Indian Arts, Rythm of the Redman, Pulse of the Pueblo, and other books. The Setons lived in New Mexico at the time, and Mr.Seton was well known for his participation in outdoor woodcraft and youth groups like scouts. The stories are very much of the period, and much more sophisticated than the stories told today. This would make a really nice gift for an adult scouter or youth leader, especially one that has an appreciation for the way the old timers used to do it.

The story comes to us in three acts, three parts, which seem to be linked by the same main character. But with the switching of memories and, at one point, of bodies it makes it hard to truly understand what is going on. Maybe it is because this is a book set in a setting developed by an earlier book? Maybe if I read the earlier books or book, I will most likely understand what is going on? But in the end all I can say is I won't be reading anything else set in this world."},{"rating":"1","title":"unreadable","review":"The plot was so contorted I couldn't follow it.

This is raw, loud, and one smoke n' live performance. I can't help but think ACDC. I hear it, and I like it....There is also something strange about JET's lead singer's voice. Call me crazy, but when I close my eyes and listen I can't help but think this is Nirvana gone Rock. Maybe it's just me, but JET's lead singer sounds alot like the late legend K. Cobain....All in all, this is an excellent show. The way a Rock show was meant to be done. I'm very impressed with JET as a live act, they sound much better live than they do on CD. This is a live band I certainly wont miss seeing next time around. They have earned my respect after seeing this.

The problem with the movie is that it's only 37 minutes long and still padded with footage of Ann talking to her mom on the phone and things like that, and it doesn't provide much actual information. It does provide proof of one thing we could already guess about Ann Coulter: She loves to be provocative. She says she loves to get hate mail. It seems like she exaggerates her hatred for liberals in order to be provocative because she's addicted to arguing and debating. And not debating with the intent of reaching any conclusions but debating just for the sake of debating.So, the film was only mildly interesting, but not worth the price of the DVD. Ann Coulter fans may like the extra material consisting of footage of some of Ann's speeches. This footage runs for about three times as long as the film itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get this!","review":"Any fan of Ann Coulter should have this dvd in their library.

The magic for me and the others in my family ended when \\"dark elves\\" appeared in the story to kidnap one of the children and take her to their evil queen.This just wasn't a good Christmas theme for a picture book. William Joyce's unique style went WAY over the top in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bizarre and full of hard words","review":"Yes, the pictures are skillful, the story is inventive, and the moral is laudable. But neither my daughter (6 yo) nor I particularly enjoyed it. The vocabulary choices are overly challenging for young children, and I found it tedious to stop and explain words every minute or so. Right in the first paragraph, I had to explain the words \\"singular,\\" \\"desperadoes,\\" and the phrase \\"he had applied himself wholeheartedly to the making of inventions...\\" Huh? What kind of young children are accustomed to expressions like these? Also, I thought the inclusion of dark elves and an evil queen to be a strange vision and unwelcome imagining of the North Pole. Definitely not a keeper for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story and Lesson","review":"I love this book. I guess I am a sentimental guy since I usually cry at the end of this book. I do not know why people are so worked up about the elves. The surprise ending of the story is wonderful. One of my favorite Christmas books."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this guy!","review":"I have several of Kendell Hogans workouts and I enjoy every one of them.

I have to day this one is very good on all levels.For a good, compact and effective sculpting workout, all the bases are covered efficiently for both the upper and lower body workout. The dvd is divided into separate sections so that the workout can be broken down into two parts. Both are clear and concise, easy to follow, fun and a decent workout for beginners and intermediates. For advanced exercisers, it offers a nice \\"easy-day\\" workout for a day you just can't make it to the gym. The dvd quality is good and the music is pretty good as well"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Basic Workout","review":"I thought this was a great intermediate workout. Kendall is energetic and cues well. Both sections have a short warm-up and very short cool down. The lower body section is all standing exercises. You'll hold dumbells while you do lunges, squats and leg lifts. Kendall makes it interesting by changing the tempo and doing different variations so it's not just boring squats and lunges. The upper body section starts with standing exercises for the back, shoulders and arms. Then you'll do a few push ups and hit the floor for chest flies. Even though it's only 20 min., Kendall covers all areas well. You move back and forth between muscle groups to keep it interesting. Kendall moves fast enough to keep you from getting bored; but doesn't move too fast. You can change weights if you need to. I felt challenged using 5 and 8lb. weights. Advanced exercisers could use this for light days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suits me fine","review":"I like this workout because it is chaptered by arms/legs. The instructor is very upbeat.

Mike Zampi's music complements Diane Kovanda's scenic footage beautifully. After a tough day at the office or a little spat with the wife-just pop in the dvd- and all will be forgotten. I thoroughly enjoyed the entire package. One particular highlight was the whale segment. Mike's musical interpretation of the playfulness of the whales was perfect.

Though I appreciated the soundtrack I was left wanting something a little more unique. I know the Cape well, so maybe I'm a bit biased however, and those new to the Cape would be more impressed. Some of the reviews here seem to be from people directly involved in production so I took them with a grain of salt.Connecticut Public Television did a great scenic program of the Cape that was similar to this but unfortunately it's not available here. This is an ok stand-in but I'm still waiting for someone to do a great visual tour of the Cape that captures it's truly breathtaking beauty, like a video version of Joel Meyerowitz photographic classic \\"Cape Light.\\" You know, those moments when the light makes you wonder weather it's even able to be documented by a photographic lens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Good","review":"Pretty Good I thought, though I wonder if the footage would look better in HD.

Why are they ripping us off for a single extension? It is better value to just replace your entire system with one that offers inexpensive extension handsets at a fraction of the price.

You won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"okay, but....","review":"This is a great box set, with a few flaws. For one, it doesn't include full albums. There are only parts of it. I usually like to buy full and complete albums because there might be songs that aren't in box sets like these. Now I can't buy the full albums because I already have 1/2 of it, it just wouldn't be worth it. If you like the \\"greatest hits\\" idea for albums, you will like this box set.

I'm 15 and I've used this guitar for about a year now nothing bad happened. Great guitar. The kit has problames mainly one thing the tuner is a fail.

However, those things aside, I love this film.It's a hilarious mockumentary detailing the making of a Bible movie by two Jewish filmmakers. This minor detail is never mentioned in the movie, but it informs a lot of what happens, such as no one knowing how many disciples Jesus had.Basically, it goes like this: if you like satire and witty dialogue, you'll like this film. I'd reccomend it to fans of movies as diverse as the Player and Dogma. If you like big slapstick comedies, avoid this like plague.Personally I like both.

It became almost impossible to draw with these sticks and my children were very disappointed with them.

I am resolved to never get another flash drive with a plastic casing again.. Maybe I am too cheap.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective and dreadful customer service","review":"Anything could be better!!. I live abroad and bought one in USA but it was defective. When I asked PNY for the warranty, they said I had to pay the shipping costs (international, BTW) to get it fixed, it was about US$34, and when they send it back they didn't made it properly and I had to pay custom fees (US$15). They said they would refund the money back but they didn't. At the end, I ended paying about US$170 dlls for an 8gb flash memory.

It didn't work on my home PC or my work PC. I had the IT staff at work take a look at each of the PNY flash drives and they had the same results as me. I spent over thirty minutes trying to find a customer service number on the PNY website. They don't have one. The only telephone number is buried in the warranty section. There is no e-mail support.

The outer shell of my last flash drive fell apart at the seams, so I am pleased I have not had a similar experience here. This drive has always been a little bulkier than I would have liked, and the removable cap is less convenient than the flip out kind. Plus the cap cannot be placed on the rear of the drive when the drive is on a key chain. The major selling point of this drive is sturdiness, the case is thick and resists crushing, and the cap actually protects the USB terminals, unlike many models.Buy this drive if you want a drive that will reliably store your data without breaking in half in your pocket, but not if you want the fanciest features in the smallest package."},{"rating":"2","title":"It went through the washer...the dryer...and still worked fine....","review":"Portable solid state storage options are plentiful and affordable these days.

I have some competitors usb flash memory, a 256MB and a 512MB, and both seem to be close to the stated amount.

It is affordable and has one gigabyte of memory. That is probably enough for someone who doesn't want to keep every little thing they've ever saved on it. It takes a little bit for it to transfer the data, but no biggie unless you're really short on time. Comes with a cap to put on the top (some flash drives don't). It also comes with a string to tie around your neck.

The only problem with it is when you use it for readyboast. Once your format it (3.99 gb by the way) it is impossible to stop it. Everytime you plug the stick into your computer it immediately starts readyboast. Since it uses 4 gigs for readyboast I really only have a 4 gig thumbdrive. So what I will do is delete readyboast whenever I have to transfer files that are larger than 4 gigs.

It's full of typos and the title is not printed on the spine.This is a fantastic story that deserves better treatment.

This is incredibly annoying to me - it feels as though Wharton is shouting at me, when we all know she would never do such a thing :-) She is much more subtle than that!--Every time Undine's name should be followed by a comma, it's followed by a period instead, thus bringing the narrative to a dead (and incorrect) stop.--Typos are starting to appear, such as \\"Mrs. Fairford\\" being typed as \\"Mrs. Pairford.\\"If this kind of thing doesn't bother you, then this will probably be fine for your Kindle, but if you find these issues as annoying as I do, you may want to look around to see if spending a few dollars will get you a cleaner version of this classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"E gads!","review":"I am a big Edith Wharton fan, however, Custom of the Country has made me question my loyalty.

She creates Undine Spragg who aspires to adapt and adjust into New York City high society which is a recurring theme in Wharton's books like Age of Innocence or House of Mirth. Unlike House of Mirth, Undine is more comical, flawed and a challenge to any actress. This book should be made into a film if it hasn't already. I don't know why we have so much junk out there. Undine is not only comical but she is scheming to break into high society regardless of how it affects her husband and friends. This book is an American masterpiece and I have rediscovered it again since I took a course in college entitled American Novel as my seminar. This is an American Classic Piece of Literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wharton's Best","review":"What a marvelous author Edith Wharton is! I like to copy passages from her books just to feel how beautifully she constructs her sentences and paragraphs. I've also read Ethan Frome, Summer, House of Mirth, and Age of Innocence; they are all terrific novels. But The Custom of the Country is her best. Could there be a worse mother, wife, or daughter than Undine? And yet, she is too pathetic to hate; she is so needy and dependent upon material things. She's perhaps the most unliberated woman in literature! Do read this novel; you will love it and learn from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"Despite the fact that Undine Spragg is an appalling woman, I found myself quite mesmerised by her (she would expect nothing less). We've all met Undines and been staggered by their total lack of empathy and their reckless indifference to the impact they have on the world around them. It should leave you quite cold, reading a novel centered around such an unpleasant person. Instead I couldn't put this book down and that must surely be because Ms Wharton has created a convincing world where the \\"good\\" don't always triumph over the \\"evil\\". Undine's only comeuppance must surely be that like the rest of us, one day she will be old and unattractive and ultimately forgotten."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for clear conception","review":"This book starts with the basic and provides various examples to make the conception clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good content, but filled with typographical errors","review":"The scope and content of the book is very appropriate for a beginning student in structural dynamics, and the organization is very nice.

I've seen or done most of the poses from this video before so I didn't feel too out of my realm. This is not meditative or relaxing in any shape or form (hence, \\"SlimDown,\\" nothing aimed at losing weight is relaxing!)--it is purely exercise. I do not consider this Yoga since a key component in Yoga is meditation.

I must be missing something since everyone else seemed to love this. I found this work out boring and repetitive. I think I did the warrior II pulse about 16 times. I thought the instructor did a good job of cueing and she was encouraging without being obnoxious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting more for my money!","review":"As a workout beginner I now look forward to getting up every morning (5 days per week). This DVD isn't overly laborious so I feel energized and realxed for my work day.

Love Ellen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"could be better 3*","review":"The exercises are good although I was expecting someting more challenging. She's a good instructor. The music is nice.

It's great for abdominals, balancing, and strength."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout!","review":"Much faster than I thought it was going to be. I'm pretty out of shape, so it's harder for me than it might be for an intermediate or advanced person. But it goes really fast, and I feel like I really worked out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another excellent DVD by Ellen Barrett","review":"With flawless cuing and fluid movement, Barrett is one the best instructors out there. The added bonus of this workout is that not only do you get to strengthen your muscles, but you stretch them as well. The standing yoga is excellent to work the tightness out of your hips, back, and along the sides of the torso. This is a workout that you can do anytime to relax and tone. I like doing it after a separate cardio workout for an added metabolic boost as well as great way to cool down and stretch. A terrific addition to your DVD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really like this video","review":"I just did this workout this morning and I really liked it. I kept popping and snapping(but in a good way), even though I workout regularly.

I have found this DVD and I have been using it for a few weeks and have already seen results. I am more toned, especially my abs. Plan to purchase the Pick your spot soon!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good for low impact and beginners","review":"i am new to yoga, and this is what i'd consider low impact. the moves repeat so it's not fast paced. Not a lot of focus on breathing like some other yoga dvds. It really helped loosen up my upper back. i felt sweaty but did not actually break a sweat. i personally liked it b/c i was able to do it, and have it on while I watched tv in the background, which made this dvd go by really fast (which is awesome). I find it hard to believe that it is a 'slim down' type routine....but I need something to help me loosen up and stretch, been feeling very stiff lately, and this achieved that goal. you don't need any extras for this (balls, weights, bands, etc.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I didn't find this to be a very good workout DVD. If you are looking for a good yoga DVD, buy Yoga Shatki instead. To me this is a light introduction to Yoga and Pilates. I didn't feel like I got a good workout at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for me","review":"I don't like it. It felt like watching an 80's workout video; the movements are too aerobic and the outfits are annoying. I much prefer real Yoga and Pilates workouts, where you can hold a pose and focus on breathing."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's easy and effective!","review":"It's a really great combination of both: pilates and yoga. It was easy enough for me as a beginner and you have the option to make certain positions more difficult with time. The trainer is great, too!

Many thermometers allow you to calibrate them with a small wrench or tool, but this one will turn just by handling it. Even if you calibrate it in the morning, by the afternoon it will be off by 5-10 degrees.I bought a couple dozen of these for my coffee shops, but ended up having to throw most away due to baristas inadvertently serving either cool drinks or scalding the milk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved It at First but it Broke after 2 months","review":"At first I just loved this thermometer for frothing the milk on my cappuccino. It has really big numbers which were a pleasure to read and was color coded so you could see at a glance the proper range for frothing. However after only a couple months use, the face twists, thereby changing the temperature reading. I tried everything to fix this but nothing worked. It is pretty useless like this since the temperature can be anything from 20-40 degrees off. ( I tested it on boiling water ) I don't know if the bolt that holds the long stem to the face got loose, but you can't tighten it. At first I thought it was just my bad luck, but then I noticed a few people commented on the same problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"As a member of the military I feel this book is a very good explanation of what it is like to be a soldier. It covers many things as to how it feels to be there and that makes it different then every other book out there. My only complaint is that it uses a few fiction books as \\"sources.\\" Now these fiction books are supposed to be real life stories told in the fiction venue but still, not credible sources. But beyond that I feel the book is a great read for anyone interested in what is is like to be a soldier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfy and nice looking sock.","review":"Great price on this comfortable, nice looking sock which does not bunch up in your shoe or slide down your leg."},{"rating":"2","title":"best season EVER!!!!","review":"I know a lot of people hate Glory, but she is my favorite buffy villain ever. After season four, with the grossness that was Riley Finn, I was seriously considering abandoning the show. But season five, despite the existence of Dawn, was a showcase for so many great characters, character developments, and plots. Anya is very likely my favorite character, and I loved the fleshing out she got this season. Out of everyone's reactions to Joycie's death, hers was by far and away the most heartbreaking. The greatest buffy moment ever was, and will always be for me, Spike telling Glory off under torture: \\"God of what? Bad home perms?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute must have","review":"Not nearly as depressing as the 6th season it was my favorite.My favorite season because without it you could not understand the main facts like who Dawn is, and how Buffy died, what Anya and Xander are arguing about,where Reiley went and why he comes back in the 6th season with a wife.was a very dramatic season and suprising at the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"so very good","review":"what do I love about this season? well, everything really. The Dawn, Glory, and Joyce storyline were superbly done. I don't think I've been moved so much since season 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is one of the best seasons of Buffy by far. Every season of Buffy has one of the best episodes of the series and season five is no exception. You will never find a better episode than \\"Fool for Love\\" or \\"The Gift.\\" This is a great season of Buffy and it is one of the best Spike seasons in the series. We really see him go through many changes that make him a better character in the end. James Marsters does an excellent job as Spike and he makes this DVD worth your money.Michelle Trachtenberg also does a fantastic job as Dawn, a character Buffy fans either love or hate. Her performance in the episode where she learns she is the key is excellent. I have never seen a young actress display that kind of pain and depth before.<P."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't see how people like this season","review":"For me season Five of Buffy is an example of where things officially went wrong, with two saving graces being the death of Joyce and Buffy and Spike getting it on, this season was a mess. The biggest mess of all was the introduction of Dawn (when family members appear out of thin air that's a huge red flag that a series is running out of ideas). No Angel, no Faith, a retarded Tara, Crusade-type Knights attacking Winabagoes, extremely cheesey big bad in Glory, and an annoying younger sister. These practically kill this season. At least Riley is gone. Get seasons 1, 2, 3 and the so-so season 4. Then wait for the series finale!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buffy Slim Set","review":"The dvds were shipped in no time and everything in excellent condition. Very great price as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the show, but my set was missing a disc!","review":"I love Buffy the Vampire Slayer - I have all 7 seasons on DVD. But when I bought this season, it arrived missing disc 5, which is a crucial part of the season. I contacted customer service, and they said since I had opened the DVD set I could not return it. I think they didn't beleive me about it missing the disc. But other than that I highly recommend this season! But you have to watch season 4 as well - That's when the show really starts to build."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slim Set!","review":"I love Buffy, or I wouldn't be buying the fifth season, so let me address this \\"slim set.\\" It's so much more manageable, with slim cases holding two DVD's each, inside the slipcase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get ready for high emotion.","review":"Spoiler warning.I really enjoyed this season because they took it in a more serious direction. I also enjoy the longer story lines as well. I was so glad to see Riely go. I liked the character, but him and Buffy together was not good. I could have done without the intro of Dawn (even more so in the last two seasons). In the later seasons she becomes to whinny and too much of a distraction. The episode \\"The Body\\" is one of the most powerful episodes I've ever seen on tv. It truely captures the feeling of death when you first have to deal with it. I also liked the fact that they included a vampire in the end of the episode to show that life still continues even in the most horrible situations. Watching the episode i just sat there almost stunned...to me the best episode of Buffy ever. Overall, a very satisfying season and left me wanting even more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth watching....now let's get Season 6 out!","review":"I agree with everything that's been said here so far. I'm glad to FINALLY see some outtakes from earlier seasons. That's been missing from the earlier DVD's. I wish the DVD's would come out sooner also.My wife/daugthter let me have mine for Christmas and so I didn't get to watch it until just this past week. But being the DVD nut I am, I watched the entire season's episodes back-to-back! And, after watching about 6 episodes my 11 year old daughter started to watch with me. So with the end of each episode I was treated to a scream of \\"next episode!\\" or \\"next disk!\\" until we finished up with a marathon Buffy watch on New Year's Eve that ended with \\"The Gift\\" just after the new year rang in. My daughter said it was the best Buffy's she had watched with me yet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buffy Season Five","review":"As it is one of my favorite shows, I was disappointed with the increasing depression in the episodes as the fifth season came about. Though frustrating, there are some episodes that are very emotion provoking. Particularly the scooby gang's various reactions to Joyce's death. As someone who lost their mom as a teenager, those episodes are very comforting in that viewers see how irrational, numb or open it is okay to be during hard times. As a side note, I will be sure to buy every single season of Buffy and if you are a true Buffy fan, then it will be worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"This season is a sad season. But I wanted to complete my collection. I love Spike. I like to watch Buffy when there is nothing else to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where in the hell did Dawn come from?","review":"I've always wanted to know where in the hell Dawn came from, and this Season 5 set tells you where she came from and why. Since I just caught the last two season when they aired originally, I just assumed Dawn had either been around, lived with her dad, or was a half sister that lived somewhere else. Well, as you can imagine, she was none of those, which proved for an interesting season. Check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Season that made me a Buffy fan","review":"I think it was the arrival of Michelle Trachtenberg actually. I sometimes watched Buffy on and off. I wasn't really a fan like I was with Charmed at the time. But now and ever since then I couldn't get enough Buffy. I love the whole concept of season 5 all Dawn is a key open a portal and Glory trying to find her. Buffy sacraficing herself for her sister in the end. It was all truely amazing. I loved this season. I plan to buy the rest of the seasons. Right now I have this season and season 6. I will probably buy either season 7 or 1 next. All depending on prices and money. But I recommend all Buffy seasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE Season Compared to the Rest, and Dawn is Why","review":"Well, the title of my review pretty much sums it up: the addition of Dawn, Buffy's little sister, ruined it for me... and quite a few other fans. I get that she's energy masquerading as a person, I get that because of that fact she needed to be the Slayer's little sis so Buffy could protect her, but what I never got is why Joss Wheadon (sp?) felt the need to include a sibling as part of the story line. I mean, the energy could have been turned into anything, didn't have to be a person, could have been a dog ~ what a better way to hide a key than that. Who knows, maybe his decision to add Dawn was political. Maybe Mr. Wheadon owed someone a debt. Whatever the reason, the series went downhill after that. I'm going to be purchasing all the seasons of BTVS except season 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"the herion revealed","review":"i really enjoyed this year of buffy the vampire slayer from its ups to its downs. i remember when dawn was origianlly interjected in the tv series and people where taken aback..what insert a new character with no intro, lol.well it worked well for this series..the sisterly interplay betwween dawn and buffy through the year were outstanding and allowed the developement of the other characters as well...all in all a great season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Keeps Getting Better","review":"I am a huge Buffy fan, and when I got this as a gift for Christmas, I couldn't wait to watch every episode! I told myself(and my parents told me too)that I wouldn't watch all the episodes too quickly, but within a week, I had seen them all more then once!This is a great addition to the Buffy series, that every true fan should have!ANd it leads into the mysterious season 6..."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best","review":"I have to say, I am a huge Buffy fan, but when i viewed this season, it soared high above what I had seen before. There was an exciting seasonal arch and stunning character development. Dawn's introduction to the show was handled well and was a fabulous edition to Buffy the Vampie Slayer. A near perfect season. Right up there with season three."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally The Best Season Has Come To DVD!","review":"Season 5 is my all time favorite season of Buffy. The season features some of the most humorous lines I've ever heard(mostly from Anya, the now human ex-demon), and introduces Buffy's sister, Dawn. This is also the season where Buffy's mother dies from post-surgery complications in one of the sadest hours on televison. You can't help but shed a few tears when you see everyone's reaction to the tragic death. This season Buffy also comes up against her weirdest enemy yet - an earthbound hell god with a fetish for shoes. As un-threatning as she sounds, she can more than stand her own against Buffy. As you've seen in previous seasons, Buffy will give everything she's got to stop the bi-monthly apocalypses of Sunnydale and in this case she gives the ultimate sacrifice - her life.ORDER IT NOW!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the point of having 4 of 7?","review":"I have to say that I am in total agreement with what has been said by ONCEAGOTH and others...season five spelled the end for the series, (I have a 12 year old niece who's not as annoying and whiny as Dawn! ) I was actually surprised to see the series go into a sixth season with her still around.... That being said, if you are a true collector and want to complete(eventually) the whole series, then buy it for that reason only. If you don't care to own the entire series but like watching Buffy on your own schedule, then buy the first four seasons and save \\"5\\" for the TV reruns."},{"rating":"2","title":"The last really good season of Buffy","review":"Ive watched the show from the beginning and I can honestly say that this was the last full season that was decent. Sure we had the musical in Season 6 and a few other memorable character moments along the way to the end but this was the most consistant writing before it started to fall apart while Joss was away doing Firefly.Season 5 had a villian on a grander scale and some very serious turns. This show has grown quite a bit over it's five seasons and so have the characters.Many argue that they should have concluded this show at the end of the season and I tend to think so myself.Points taken away for the whiney Dawn character that they never did anything with but overall a fine season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Awesome set. Slim set was cheaper. Same great Buffy action. Even better for the environment using less packaging. Slay the Vamps, Save the World!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"Spoilers ahead.Buffy maintains its brilliance in this fifth season.The cast is as strong as ever, and Sarah Michelle Gellar in particular shows us just what a brilliant actress she is. The ingenious addition of Buffy's little sister, Dawn, would have to be the most creative way to introduce a family member in all of television. Only, by season's end Dawn's starting to get annoying. This is a pity really, as the wonderful Michelle Trachtenberg is a true talent - it's her character who's the problem.But it is hard to find better television than this. Buffy retains it humour and its heart at the same time as delivering the big storylines. It can tackle over the top supernatural craziness as brilliantly as it does human tragedy - such as the tear jerking episode where Buffy comes home to find her mother lying dead on the couch, and then the later episode where the sisters discover the consequences of raising the dead - and letting them go.This is television at its best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Difference between boxed sets","review":"Hi there, I own this slim boxed set and it has:6 DVD in 3 boxes (i've shared images of this)subtitles and spoken in spanish, english and frenchIt also contains closed Caption.No cuts from the original boxed set. IT'S THE SAME!!! but in other package."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Change In The Series","review":"Originally thought to be the final year of the series, season five works well as a transitional piece. You'll notice throughout, and espicially with the final episode, that Joss wasn't certain whether or not the series would continue for future seasons.Above all other years of Buffy, season five marks a turning point in the series; the introduction of new characters, and the fleshing out of those who already exist, is enthralling to watch. Whether you feel that the series was better left to five seasons, or was more suited being drawn out through season seven, the fifth DVD is a must see for buffy fans, and crucial point to the development of the buffy world. A must-have for all fans of the show."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"OK, I am sure that I am joining the chorus of Buffy fanatics here, but this season rocks. The best part is Spike's growing \\"love/madness\\" for Buffy. The episode where Spike faskes a date with Buffy is one of my all-time favorite Joss Whedon episodes--including Firefly. \\"It's not blood, it's bourbon.\\" LOL!To break from the chorus, I do not believe that this was the last great season of Buffy.

Over a months time I sat and watched every episode, in order, until I reached the season finale. It was then I realized I had been cheated out of one of the best moments in Buffy history. When the episode aired on television, there was an introduction where moments from the first five seasons were shown in rapid succession while a type of thriller-horror film soundtrack was played. The images and music were played at an accelerating pace until it reached such a fevered pitch that the screen practically exploded into the next shot where the camera follows a chase down a dark ally. Somehow, to my crushing disbelief, this intro didn't find its way onto the DVD. What the hell? Hay Fox, this isn't the complete fifth season.The shows themselves gets five stars. Getting screwed out of a fantastic Buffy moment on the DVD gets four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this series!","review":"I really love this series and the DVDs always have lots of extras. Start with season one and enjoy them all. (My husband loved it too once I talked him into giving it a shot!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Which box? Slim Set? Really?","review":"Well, I was hoping for a slim set (small box with three slim DVD cases, each containing two discs), but I got the single case version. Which was the very thing I was hoping to avoid. I want all the seasons to match! Come on!Now, it IS season five on six discs, but be aware that what you see may not be what you get. From the looks of the reviews, some people DID get the right box set. But I didn't!Of course if you don't care what it looks like on the outside, not big deal. I'm sure season five is going to be fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Had a hard time with Dawn at first . . .","review":"I had a hard time with Dawn at first, but she definitely grew on me, as the story was revealed. Stick with it; I really think it's worth it. This is one crazy, action-packed season, and for some reason *this* apocalypse seemed much more personal than any of the last ones. It's great to see Xander growing up and becoming more aware of his own powers, and although I dislike the the way they put Willow in a \\"gay box\\" (which seems to imply that her past relationships weren't \\"real\\"), I love seeing her relationship with Tara develop, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"YaY Buffy!","review":"I love this series. I was in high School when it first premiered on the WB currently known as CW. I thought it would be nice to relive the experience. If you love supernatural or are a fan of dark stuff check out Buffy.

That episode saved this season."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dawn is sunset of series","review":"Let me add my vote to the debate as to whether or not the fifth season introduction of Dawn \\"jumped the shark\\".My vote is definitely YES. This was not only the low water mark for the series, but for me it was the end of the series. A series which, pre-Dawn, I had enjoyed very much.After tolerantly watching the first three episodes of season five, patiently waiting for any kind of explanation of where this stupid annoying brat of a little sister came from, I gave up.As far as I'm concerned, Buffy had four great seasons before she was slain by lazy writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can people like this?!?!","review":"I absolutly HATED this season. It was the worst of all. I'm a huge Buffy fan and I found myself rolling my eyes every time that Dawn even said anything. While Buffy was trying to save the world after her mother died, Dawn just acted like a jerk..all the time. She was the main focus of the WHOLE SEASON!! Not Xander and Anya's love, not Giles' new found anger, not Willow's growing magical power, DAWN AND ALL DAWN! I think Spike was the best character besides Buffy in the whole season because you see him going through forbidden and very frowned upon love with Buffy. I also think that Grace was very good even though she was gone soon. I think back to the other seasons and just want it the way it was. No Dawn, mother still alive, Buffy with a boyfriend, and no Dawn! For those Season 5 loving people, I'll be waiting for your \\"I do not find this review helpful.\\" ;-D"},{"rating":"1","title":"GARBAGE","review":"Dawn SHOULD have DIED at the end.

She had a few \\"cute\\" moments, but for the most part was AWFUL. She deserved to be SLAPPED for copping such an attitude. I HATED her character. They should have spent more time on Anya. Now she is GREAT. She should have her own spin-off. So should Willow & Tara. Nearly everyone was GREAT this season, EXCEPT Dawn. Ugh. What a disaster putting her in the show was. Buffy should not have had to waste so many tears on that little wench.The other MAJOR problem is that this show was composed with a wide, 1.78:1 aspect ratio, yet all you get here is the \\"standard\\" 1.33:1 square ratio, and it the cropping is obvious in MANY shots.

There was no moment on television more moving than the very last scene of \\"The Gift,\\" the shot of Buffy's tombstone. Glory has to be, in my opinion, the best \\"big bad\\" in any of the seasons.

Over-used heavy handed guitar, raw amateurish vocals droning on and on. Nothing special here. It sounds just like everything else of its genre.

Any adult, who cooks like this doesn't cook often, cooks professionally or spends most of their waking hours in a kitchen.For example, who in a modern home kitchen cuts a stick of butter, melts it in a pan then pours it into a (plastic, microwave safe) mixing bowl? Great, now there's a pan, a knife and a cutting board to wash! It is a children's cookbook, so why not cut down on time spent with knives, stovetop flames and inevitable messes by just melting the uncut butter in the plastic mixing bowl with the microwave?Nice pictures, large font, recipes are great, but (in my opinion) obviously written by someone working in a fully staffed professional kitchen, not a home."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent cookbook for budding chefs!","review":"I got this for my 7 yr old daughter.She and I both loved the book, the info it provided, the recipes and the photos!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the kid's cookbook","review":"This really is a great book for kids!

In her earlier work in the Fit for Life series (authored with husband Harvey Diamond)and her American Vegetarian Cookbook, she led about half a million people to health by offering an appealing vision of vegetarianism as a healthy alternative to the meat- and dairy-laden standard American diet, which has led to so much disease and human suffering. Now, with her new book Fitonics she says flank steak is a great option for a light lunch. Is she for real? I can't help but think she is too easily influenced by her partner du jour. Marilyn, stick up for something sometime. . .

I was looking for a book that would teach me more about being healthy, instead I get philly cheesesteak recipes. While I understand the need for a little flexibility, I would prefer someone to give me good advice about what I SHOULD do and allow me to decide how flexible I want to be about it. Giving me ideas about a healthy diet of red meat and fat filled dairy products is not my idea of a helping hand. Try again, Marilyn, this was a real disappointment. Then again, don't write another one if it will simply be more telling people what they want to hear whether it's good for them or not!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic Attempt to Cash In!","review":"I have read both Fit For Life and Living Health, as well as Fitonics. After reaping such benefits from Fit for Life and Living Health I was anxious to learn more from Marilyn. However, I found this book to be devoid of any real diet plan or sound information. It seemed that the authors' should have written a book about meditation instead of healthy eating. I for one am unsure that I can trust a person who waffles between vegetarianism and meat eating all in the same day! I also found it very convenient that the cover of the book proudly declares Marilyn as the Co-Author of the Fit for Life books while inside the book she tears down the very principles she is displaying on her cover, talk about cashing in on the reputation Harvey built! If you are really look for a informative health book try Fit for Life, try ANYTHING else but this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOW I'M CONFUSED","review":"I have recently discovered Fit For Life and was amazed at the results, suddenly the rules are changing again according to Marilyn. Yes I have read the book, and I'm not sure what I think. I find it very confusing. The rules have changed a little too much. There are some sound facts and maybe some good advise here but for Fit For Life enthusiests, I suggest proceeding with caution when purchasing this book, it may not be what your looking for. Take a borrow from the library first maybe? I'm very curious to know what Harvey Diamond has to say about this new advise. I'd take what he has to suggest a little more seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly-written, nothing new, unfocused, illogical concepts","review":"This book brings nothing new to the nutrition arena.

I follow it every day and I don't think it is all that hard! To me it sounds like Marilyn got re-married and with her old marriage not only dropped the husband but also most principles of her former lifestyle! Why do I have to take supplements now when all this time I have been in such a good health and full of energy? No, to me it doesn't sound like a good idea, sorry! Now they need all these fancy words like: fitonics, mindtonics, bodytonics, fruitonics...but still don't give me enough reason for most of the \\"new\\" principles in this lifestyle!

It felt very disjointed, although I think I would've enjoyed the overall story if it was longer and written by someone who likes people."},{"rating":"1","title":"The year of the hare","review":"I personally did not care for the translation. It was done in British English and I did not like it! The story itself is nice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty and sarcastic!","review":"If you like Vonnegut, read this book. Paasilinna's humor and sarcasm are very similar to Vonnegut's. However, it is unique in that it has a distinctly Finnish touch to it.

I was laughing out loud in during many parts of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacked Depth","review":"I feel sure that reading this in the original language would have been more satisfying. The translation was awkward at times. I also felt like this was a novel I would have written back in junior high... Back then I enjoyed writing and thinking about odd and random things happening in life, which is all this book seemed to be. It also felt like the author was not comfortable writing dialogue, so avoided that almost altogether, and the main character didn't have much depth to him. Mildly entertaining, but a disappointing read overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice read","review":"This book was somewhat different than expected--perhaps more serious. But a great tale with likable main characters and ample dry humor nonetheless!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Year of the Hare","review":"Arto Paasilinna is one of Finland's most translated authors and \`The Year of the Hare\` is his most popular novella, first published in 1975. It is a sort of return to nature story and a rejection of civilization - obviously Rousseauian in sentiment, the book is very popular among the French, and Romantics everywhere. The hare is the wild heart in us all - injured by a car, the main character nurses it back to health and then takes to the woods where he finds an ongoing struggle between taming the wilderness versus going feral, one often leading to the other. It's cute, often funny, and has a geographic path that can be followed on a map that helps one to learn more about Finlands more obscure locations in the north. Apparently many of the characters who cross the pages of this \\"picaresque novel with an ecological theme\\" are stereotypical Finnish. In the end Paasilinna saves the hare but kills the bear (and the crow and the forest etc..), it is cynical, it is Finnish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Friendship with strange persons and a hare is good for you.","review":"This book tells about hardboiled businessman who meets a hare when he is driving in dark night.

Just cornball and had to fast forward through the entire movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nightmare before Christmas","review":"Christmas comedy movies can range from the sublime (Christmas Vacation, Home Alone) to the pitiful ( Ernest Steals Christmas). \\"Deck The Halls\\" sets a new low standard in Christmas offerings with it's horrible script, poor acting and shallow plot. I rented this with the memories of Matthew Broderick's funny and convincing performance in \\"Ferris Beuller's Day Off\\", but realized quickly into the movie that Sir Lawrence Olivier couldn't have made a convincing character out of this horrible script. Danny DeVito shows his inability to create a laugh, hoping that his gnome-like smallness will get him the laughs. He fails miserably..The only reason this movie receives 1 star is due to the lack of a lower possible grade. Save your money and time and let the Griswalds bring some Christmas laughs again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Movie","review":"This could very well be the worst movie I have ever seen.

Some light humor with beautiful scenery. Whoever was the set designer did an outstanding job. But other than that, they took two good actors and turned them into the most obnoxious guys you'd ever meet. One sells his wife's cherished family heirloom to put lights on his house so that it can be seen from space (why anybody would want to do that is beyond me) and the other nearly blows his house up with his family inside because he wanted to give his neighbor a heart attack.In the end, Danny Devito's house is seen from space but what sense of accomplishment does he get from that? It can be seen from space. Now what? The whole premise of the movie is just stupid.And was Matthew Broderick the ONLY other neighbor? Nobody else in the neighborhood would have complained about the music blasting until 4am?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck this movie is terrible","review":"I had to give it one star but it is probably a 0 star movie. The characters are not likable. The script is predicable, The acting is awful. All in all this was a total waste of film. Matthew Brodrek is stiff and recites his lines as if he is a robot. (too many gigs as gadget maybe?) Danny DeVito is dislikable and a bum. Not a character you want to get behind and cheer. The teenager girls are are an afterthought for a tastless joke. The dad's don't know it's their daughters who are dancing and they start yelling \\"who's your daddy\\". This is disgusting. The mother's are just there to further the plot, not characters that are needed at all, nor do you feel anything for or about them. Christmas time is a wonderful time for family. These families are sad and disgusting. Don't waste your families time with this movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Within five minutes I knew this movie isn't for me and shut it off.

I love them. However, this is one that I did not love. There is no real plot. It's just something about how one neighbor can get so jealous over another and Danny Devito is his usual hateful self. There was plenty of cleavage but not much movie. Who would believe that a man has his Christmas trees planted for the next five years and who didn't see that something awful was going to happen to them? Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Its October and Halloween has not passed, yet everyone seems to be getting ready for Christmas. My mother bought this film and i've never watched it, so I picked it up and watched it. Oh my god, what a piece of crap! The story is beyond stupid and the acting was bad. I stopped this film halfway thru and downloaded Frank Sinatra's A Jolly Christmas instead. Avoid this movie if you want to have a Merry Christmas."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time","review":"What a waste of time & talent. I usually love Chrismas movies, but this one totally misses the mark. DeVito is missing his signature wit. Broderick looks constipated.

It had none of the uplifting scenes you expect from a holiday movie.

Horrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed the movie - Deck the Halls","review":"I have heard mixed reviews on this movie. My husband and I really enjoyed it and will purchase the DVD when it is released. It is a classic, not some \\"here today, gone tomorrow\\" flick. It is rated PG and is the type of movie that a person must just relax, watch and enjoy. A definite must for my DVD library! My parents, teens and our grandchild also saw and enjoyed it.Matthew Broderick and Danny DeVito play adversaries who are in competition to be the \\"Christmas Guy\\".

Laughter all the way.This comedy was a happy way to view movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Christmas lights you'll like this movie","review":"This movie isn't high on the professional reviewers list but then I rarely watch those kind of movies anyway. It's a movie about two guys at odds with each other over Christmas lights that can be seen from space. It's been on TV a few times this year but I bought the DVD if that tells you anything. I also like all the vacation series movies so you should like this one if you like those kind of movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"No One In Hollywood Has Seen Winter","review":"There is simply too much about this tragedy of a film to criticize, so I'm only going to throw out one pet peeve. The sprayed on snow in this movie set in central Massachusetts stays the same all the way through December. It never melts or gets deeper, nor is it ever cleared from the street that separates Matthew Broderick's house from Danny DeVito's, enabling DeVito to secrete an extension cable between their houses---in order to power his Christmas light display--- for the entire month of December without anyone noticing. That alone should give you a good idea about the level of talent of the writers. I felt sorry for Matthew Broderick thinking he needed to take a job like this. DeVito is slumming too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"For me, I am okay for this movie. It is just a typical Christmas movie. The acting is just the worst part of the whole movie. It is because they are kind of exaggerating. There are some other Christmas movie that I saw before were better than this one. Overall, it is okay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie goes nowhere with no laughs","review":"The movie has a fast paced beginning and feels like a decent promise.However, absolutely nothing humourous happens, and there are tons of non-sequiters. The script gets very lazy and just hops from one scene to the next without rhyme or reason. Broderick sleep walks and Devito is rusty.A big disapointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh is about all I can think to say","review":"I rented this movie because I love Christmas movies, and I am always looking for one to add to the collection.

I love Christmas movies and was looking forward to seeing something new. We really enjoyed it, but you have to go into realizing it's silly funny and relies on slapstick humor. Nothing earth-shattering but still an enjoyable way to spend the evening. It's fairly predictable with two neighbors fighting for dominance to see who will be the \\"Christmas King\\" and both losing sight of the true spirit of Christmas. Everything gets so out of control that they manage to make total fools out of themselves but it's pretty humorous to watch. :-)I particularly enjoyed the casting of the two wives (Kristin Davis and Kristin Chenoweth).

The obnoxious new neighbor, the feud between neighbors, the neighbor with so many Christmas lights you can't sleep, the guy who ends up destroying his own house in his fight against someone else, etc., etc.Deck the Halls takes a tried-and-true plot (or rather, a combination of elements from tried-and-true plots) and adds absolutely nothing new. The performances were fine, and it had funny moments, but it was also absolutely predictable, which was a huge distraction from the comedy. It's hard to be amused when you know exactly what's coming next.There's a bit of an attempt to make the movie about both men trying to find meaning in their lives, but there's nothing really character-specific in it, and it gets lost among the cliches.I love holiday movies, but this one won't make it into my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought it was a pretty good movie","review":"I got this movie previously viewed for $4 from a Hollywood Video that was going out of business.

In researching Checkpoint issues I've been struck by the extent to which \\"Phoneboy\\" is personally identified with the topic, both by newbies and by seasoned professionals. It's for good reason. This book is extremely thorough (within its scope) and brings alot to the table in the way of the details that a professional would need. I've read alot of technical texts, but this one stands out, both generally and with the specific topic. The book is written well, with a good structure and giving useful examples.

I didn't even realized he is not Tony until I started watching the movie for 5 minutes.Stay away from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Born to fight","review":"Um... you people are way too kind in your reviews of this film. I am a huge movie collector and my vault contains hundreds of martial arts films alone. People, this movie is awful! Dan Chupong is no Tony Jaa. If you like On-Bak or the Protector and are under the impression that this is like, or even as good as those movies, you will be dissappointed. You WILL find yourself saying \\"this is stupid\\" the entire time watching this movie. As far as the stunts go, some are pretty decent, but there is nothing that we havent seen before. The martial arts in this movie are sloppy and sub standard.

I am surprised Dragon Dynasty released this.Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough action for an action movie!","review":"The highlights of this film is the cinematography and the previews for another movie (Seven Swords) on the DVD! The intro had potential but the movie dragged in the middle before getting into some serious action toward the end. The Thai patriotism scene was really the stand up moment of the movie as well as the Buddhist priest scene in the midst of a gunfight. Perhaps the plot line is a little clearer to those who could listen to it in the original Thai but with sub-titles it is a stretch. It is a good escape from reality for about 96 minutes and the behind the scene stunt setups were also interesting. If you are expecting lots of martial arts action then this will be a disappointment. While Born to Fight may have been from the creators of Ong-Bak, they missed the target on this one. Is it a middle of the road, typical Thai action movie that may develop a limited following in the US."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best!","review":"Hands down one of the best action/martial arts movies ever!

Sacrimental beer? Yeah, check.This album may not be the traditional, strewn-in-misery blues that we have all come to know and love (or despise, depending on how you look at it), but Blues Traveler's BASTARDOS! manages to capture the spirit and energy that makes blues music what it is. Combining expert musicianship with powerful vocals and superior songwriting, BASTARDOS! is an album blending rock, country, and blues into a sound that can only be described as awesome. Maybe not the absolute best record ever made...but who really gives a hoot? This album is FUN, and that's what I like in my music. Really, who knew heartache could be so entertaining?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Summer-Bastardos!","review":"This very well could be the oddest album in the Blue's Traveler discography.

Perhaps i'm being too kind as i think Summerteeth is one of the amazing albums of our lifetime....BUT you can tell hear Jay Bennetts influence all over this album. Definitely the most \\"pop sounding\\" album by Blues Traveler, if you are interested i'd recommend going to their site as you can listen to their albums in their entirity and thusly get a feel for it.A way different vibe for them, sometimes it works wonderfully and other times not quite as well as i would've hoped. Still, with a band as talented as BT and a producer who was as talented as JB, it has some fine highs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Their worst album to date","review":"I own all of Blue Traveler's studio albums, own some of their live stuff, and have seen them live. I would consider them among my 10 or so favorite bands, so it pains to be say this -- but this is a horrible album. I keep thinking that I need to listen to it a little more to give it another chance, but frankly, I'm not sure it's even worth it. What surprises most is that the album directly preceeding this one, \\"Truth Be Told\\" is among their very best work. I'd love to write a glowing review for one of my favorite bands, but I can't. If you're looking for a BT album to start with, don't begin your adventures with the band with this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aptly titled.","review":"Started listening to BT when Four was released.Have purchased every studio album since then.Consider Straight On ... to be an overlooked masterpiece.Have been happy with every BT purchase ...

This book directly answered many questions that came up for me, which I had struggled trying to figure out with tracing paper and clay models. Especially the difference in proportions between males and females, and the differences in \\"contact\\" between males and females, is something hard to gather or not covered at all in other anatomy books. I still study anatomy and draw from life regularly, and this book has helped all of that fall into place when it comes to drawing poses without a model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Helpful and nice poses","review":"When I bought this book I was a little unsure if it would be helpful or not, but I'm relly glad I got it! It has tons of helpful poses and some I probaly wouldnt have thought of! It has some nudity so be wary of that, and it also has some bedroom scenes at the end. Not for young children, but other than that very good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book","review":"I knew that I wanted this book when I first laid my eyes on it. Inside this book it shows you the theory behind drawing couples, from dating to making love, and techniques of manga artists' as a added bonus. This book has little sample images of couples meeting in public, going on a date, and them walking together. Another good thing about this book is that they give you examples of how to correctly draw the couples together holding hands, jumping on one another, and kissing playfully. So if you are looking for a book that has couples ( as well as same sex couples) then this is definately for you! This book would be ideal for those looking to create a love story manga. For those who object to nudity, I don't recommend this book. It has nude scenes as well as sexual situations. This is also NOT a kid friendly book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly offers HOPE!!!!","review":"This book changed my family. I gave this book to my mom after she was diagnosed with breast cancer.

A friend gave me a copy a few months ago and I couldn't put it down until I'd finished the last page. Cancer patients need hope, and this is it. I honestly can't think of a book that touched me more in terms of encouragement. I always like to say that cancer is 1/2 mental. Of course the laboratory tests may prove different, but a mind frame that has no hope it oftentimes the one that is overcome the soonest.

This set has got to be one of the best I've ever heard in the D&B;/Jungle genre! She starts with a few startling tracks, but I grow to love even them more and more! The rest of the whole CD just gets better and better until I nearly pulled the CD out of my car and framed it on the mantle! If you enjoy a good Junglist album with a little house feel (alot of vocals, but wonderful!) you'd be insane not to add this to your collection! Also, WE NEED another set from Jen Lasher!

This book should be filed under horror in bookstores. It is an account of one fatal adventure in the Andes.

Of course weather changes to hurricane and although the continue descent, they are both bound to death."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic solo survival story.","review":"This first person narrative of solo survival transcends the mountaineering genre. It is a classic story of a blending of human will, mental and physical stamina, technical knowledge, creativity, and inner serenity (notwithstanding whirling fear) capable of surmounting monstrously intimidating circumstances. It is a land companion to Steven Callahan's \\"Adrift.\\" Both books are nearly exhausting while nearly impossble to put down. Both are written in clear prose that engages a reader not previously knowlegeable of the specialized stage upon which the drama occurs. They are thus both very educational on many planes. Both leave the reader somehow better poised and cathartically wiser in the face of more mundane challenges. I would welcome other readers' tips on any other books that might match these books' high standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great story.

However,I find the recap of his experiences rather empty. I cannot imagine being this desperate for survival without some kind of spiritual awaking. Instead, Simpson continually unleashes a string of curses for his bad luck. Additionally, after surviving, there is no mention of his recovery, his thankfulness for making it through, nor any plans for future climbing. It was a disappointing book that leaves the reader hanging."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring account of an exciting adventure","review":"this book is highly overrated by fellow readers. i could barely finish it. compared to \\"into thin air\\" this was a drag. the prose is boring and didn't hold my interest at all. i had no \\"feel\\" for the characters whatsoever, quite frankly didn't care one way or the other what happened to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing that either of them survived.","review":"Simpson brings the reader into the depths of despair with him, and then slowly, brings them back from the brink of death.

I was warmed by the camaradery between Simon & Joe; frightened by the prospect that lay before them; chilled by the decisions that the each had to take; and finally brought to tears in the climax of this wonderful story.I bought this book for my mother in an attempt to explain to her why I climbed mountains. How foolish..."},{"rating":"2","title":"great story","review":"Joe Simpson has a great story for you about himself and a climbing buddy. Boy stuff goes wrong and, oh no, survival situation.

To be left for dead and know that your injury is very severe is a situation many of us will never have to face and and few can comprehend. Simpson proves that in light of your situation you can force your body to continue. To have a mind set so powerful and to not give into the voices in your head telling you to stop takes the courage only few can ever attain. The book is by far one of the best books written about high altitude climbing. It's easy to read, is straight to the point, and captures your imagination. A great piece of work. His other books: This game of Ghosts, and Storms of Silence are also very compelling. A must read as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unforgettable book","review":"One of the best stories I've ever read.

(and not to mention consistent with the first one)1) inspector gagdet should have been played by matthew broderick, in my opinion, he was and always will be the perfect gadget.2) they should have had the lady whose father created him in the first movie, ig was supposed to fall in love with her, but they conpletely left her out in this movie!!!!3) the special effects are TERRIBLE!!!!!!4) dr. claw really bothered me in this one...in short, ladies and gentlemen, this is, yet again, proof of how really desperate disney is."},{"rating":"1","title":"i hate french stewart he is one terrible actor","review":"this movie stinks i strongly dislike it what makes me wanna hate this movie even more is that french stewart is in it this movie stinks french stewart is one lousy lazy actor this movie stinks do not waste your money on this terrible movie buy something else instead"},{"rating":"1","title":"INSPECTOR GADGET 2","review":"My family and I watched the first Gadget and really liked it.

Then i watch the first one and it was good( sort of). But i had too much hope for this one because i expected don adams. At the end of the first one he made an apperance as the voice of brain. So i rented this to see what they continued and what i got was THIS! Pete jr from the goofy cartoon of the ninties is brain, french stewart is gadget,he falls in love with an android, and now all his faults are caused by a chip, and what happend to the good doctor.

I got the DVD off a buddy that works in a blockbuster from a preview disc.That guy off 3rd rock couldnt even save this lamo flick.The actors looked ashamed to be acting in it. no wonder Rupert Everet hid his face this time. The special effects, which all this film has to save it were soooo fake ! My 7 year old twins even hated this one, but they enjoyed the first movie.Man I liked the cartoon, but I thought this ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The kids will love it!","review":"With bold cartoon colors and gadgets and gizmos a plenty, this will keep the kids entertained for hours and hours as they play it over and over again. This time round Inspector Gadget is played by French Stewart - he's just perfect for this role - he's boldly cartoonish and so clumsy you just can't help but love him. His antics and gadget 'glitches' will make you laugh and the special effects really bring it to life. With everything from eye-popping spring loading gadgets to the return of the much loved wise-talking Gadgetmobile.This one is especially for the kids - with a very welcomed 'G' rating - The DVD is packed with extras that even the Mum's and Dad's will enjoy, such as the bloopers and deleted scenes. I've already preorderd one for my niece's birthday - she's 7 and a big fan of the Inspector Gadget cartoons. - I know this won't disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliantly written without pedantry","review":"This book is one of those books that makes you wonder why you bother with fiction. Fletcher has created such brilliant characterizations, and his writing is so witty and fine, that it is a sensual pleasure to read. This kind of book is why one bothers to read at all; truly lovely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the seeker of enlightenment in the subject","review":"Although the book may be engaging and interesting to some, and has on occasion been used in University courses (with due precaution and warnings), it does contain some bias and factual mistakes. If you are looking for an interesting read that'll give you some insight into the history without expecting academic accuracy, then go ahead. I personally did not enjoy reading it, because of its lack of accuracy and the sometimes obvious bias. Nevertheless, the author does not make claim to be writing a strictly academic book, but rather a leisurly one that would interest the traveller to the region. As long as you don't take it too seriously, and don't rely on it too heavily, then you might enjoy its fluid style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably the best popular work on the topic","review":"Richard Fletcher's \\"Moorish Spain\\" is a refreshing tonic against the plethora of books on Islamic Spain idealizing the supposed 'Convivencia' (especially, \\"The Ornament of the World\\" by Maria Rosa Menocal). Fletcher avoids the tendency among many scholars who wish to find an apt, hopeful (albeit unrealistic) Christian-Islamic modus vivendi for Europe's present-day demographic predicament based on a romaticized model of medieval Spain. Presented in a well-researched, matter-of-fact fashion, the 'good' is presented in the context of the 'bad and the ugly'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative and interesting","review":"I can't compare this book with other treatments of the Muslims in Spain, because it's the only one I've read. Being both compact and comprehensive, it can be very dense in places; nevertheless, it is both enlightening and readable. The book served to considerably augment my avocational, patchwork grasp of world history, and I enjoyed it. It should appeal to a wide audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"engaging","review":"700 years of slaughter nicely summarized in a consise 175 pages.

I am; however, left with one question which, I believe, is rather important. What kind of book is it? Is it a collection or small library of books? Is it a science book? Is it a law book? Is it a wisdom book or a worship book? Or, is it a single story? I'd really like to know. The answer to this question seems to lie at the assumption level for this author but is never articulated for the reader. Without that question being addressed it seems difficult to interpret the content with much confidence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Living by the book workbook","review":"I don't know what it is about workbooks regarding the Bible, but whoever develops the questions is really out there..ordered it by mistake vs the book I got later...I think I'm going to like the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you so much, I couldn't purchase anything better!","review":"This is a awesome book.

The narrative lacks focus and cohesion - it is not well-written. The reader does not get a true feeling for Tuscany. The author is stuck on relating tales of the sad and macabre. I had hoped that as a sculptor and artist, the author would be able to put into words all the beautiful, singular qualities of Tuscany and the Italian people. Sadly, this is not the case. I guess the best way to sum up this book is to say it lacks joy and warmth, which to me are essential elements of Tuscany. Spare yourself the agony (and the pricey shipping and handling charges)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Dry","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. I found the writing to be dry and bordering on judgmental in many instances. It's as if he cannot help but view the country and its people through a filter; a filter in which everything \\"foreign\\" is suspect, sinister or stupid. He occasionally is able to move beyond that mindset and provide small, insightful, glimpses into the people and customs of the country, but those moments are far too brief in comparison with the overall body of the work. I would not recommend this book unless you are simply out of other reading material."},{"rating":"2","title":"A moving tribute to a beloved teacher","review":"This was Rabbi Dresner's final work.

Jim Henson was a genius, pure and simple and this book is a glorious representation of his gifts to the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for the Henson fan","review":"I grew up on Jim Henson's Muppets as did many, many others. This book shows so much of Henson's life (he was cute!) and the legacy of the Muppets. From Sam and Friends to Seasame Street to Labyrinth and so many other wonderful works. The behind the scene stories are wonderful (I especially like the story of the pipe closet). I also like the pages from The Muppet Show that show every guest on the show.

It is through, has great cross-references, and is relatively cheap. Sadly, however, that is pretty much where the positive ends and the negative begins.As has been said before, the orgainzation is pretty terrible. No one section fully covers all they want to say about a particular drug, and most medical schools present it in a different fashion. I spend half my time flipping around finding the relevant section about which I want to read.Also, is it too much to ask that medical textbooks be properly bound? A flimsy paperback with cheap binding simply won't stand up to the rigors of lugging this book back and forth to class every day.Not Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly an introductory text","review":"The is a review of a pharmacy student. Unfortunately, this is a required text for my medchem/pharmacology class. You can ask any student in my class and majority of us would have the same complaint. This book is extremely difficult to follow. For example they give you a table for alpha and beta adrenergic receptors. While the table is more or less OK describing different beta receptor types, it doesn't tell much about alpha receptors. The authors of this omit a lot of important details. They don't write much about medications' side effects. In general this book makes it difficult to distinguish medications of each group from each other. On the better side, the book provides a lot of chemical structures, which make medchem part easier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money, buy Lippencott or Goodman","review":"I threw this book in a bonfire after I discovered Goodman.

Once in a Lifetime is a great first single, but there are other great songs that I look forward to Urban releasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"livn4urban","review":"Just when you think he can't top the last one...The mix on the CD is incredible. It's a heartfelt creation that incorporates upbeat, toe tapping, banjo pick'n funk with the best of Keith's acoustic guitar and melodic sound that we've all grown to love. Don't put a label on his music. Sit back and enjoy...WHAT A RIDE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatness","review":"This is one of my favorite albums and I love it!

I bought it early this morning and I am listening to it for the second time today and it is only 9:00 in the morning. I think this is going to be another 4X Platnium at least for Keith if not more. I love the whole CD and Keith's talent is just amazing. I recommend this CD to anyone who likes to listen to good music whether or not you like country music. I have turned many of my friends who don't like country music onto Keith's music. Keith is also now a three time CMA Male Vocalist winner. I was in tears last night when they read his name. I am so glad the he got the award, because he deserves it. I am hoping to be able to see Keith again in concert for his next tour."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck happened???","review":"I unwrapped the CD with glee... yes glee.

When Alec Breckridge discovers that the young \\"he\\" is really a \\"she,\\" he is determined to transform Kate into the woman she was meant to be. Alec is a wonderful hero -- kind, sensitive, and loving. Independent Kate challenges his sense of honor and quickens his pulse with desire. The story has several twists. I found myself pulling for this odd couple as they worked to overcome serious obstacles to a meaningful relationship. The love affair of two special secondary characters is an added pleasure. Ms. George's novel moves along at a fast pace and weaves mystery, romance, and drama into every page. LIKE NO OTHER brings a panorama of emotions to the reader. Don't miss this captivating tale!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like No Other","review":"Fox is a pickpocket and a thief of great skill, but her confidence is shaken when she is caught by a lord. She is given to the lord's friend Alec, who has been told that he needs to care for a \\"charity case\\" to be popular with the ladies. Soon enough, he finds out that Fox, though the tough leader of a gang, is female and also known as Kate. She falls in love with Alec, though all the while she is drawn back to her life on the streets, especially Falcon, a member of her group who is very special to her. Alec fears she is too young for the way he feels about her. Melanie George takes a tried and true plot and infuses it with sparkling wit and charming characters.

All he does is spew out some sophomoric partial rhymes about is his full-throttle horniness, smoking pot, and partying. This is something that any 7th grade boy can do. You just have to laugh at a guy whose rhymes include: \\"I've got hos/In different area codes.\\" I mean this guy doesn't look like he's serious: he looks like a parody of a rapper on Saturday Night Live. Just look at the stupid cover art that seems to be pulled out of MAD magazine. Ludacris' lyrics are very misogynistic, and he seems to see women as nothing more than sex objects and human punching bags. Oddly enough, chicks dig this moron. Yes, Ludicris can rap. But so can Aaron Carter and Lil' Bow Wow. Anyone who can talk can rap. Stop this immaturity and get this dumbass off the radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time (and money)","review":"This cd is bad and this comes from someone who really respects Luda for his community work.

The skits are kind of annoying. However, Luda has some of the most clever rhymes in the history of rap with great metaphors. Highlights include: \\"Teamwork\\" (the beat is kinda cheesy/happy but it's so damn catchy), \\"We Got\\" (the coughing beat, the rat-a-tat-tat gunfire, this song is just ridiculous and Chingy steals the show on this one), \\"P Poppin'\\" (fun song, nuff said, and Shawna steals the show), and of course, the ubiquitous first single, \\"Stand Up,\\" which is a classic Ludacris first single."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not on par with other cd's by Luda.","review":"This cd is nothing like the hot party joints that Luda has released in the past. There are a few bright spots on the album, but not enough to make you wanna buy the album.

The 2 Songs produced by Three 6 Mafia Producers DJ paul & Juicy J are really gread (Diamond In The Back & We Got). Especially \\"We Got\\" has a GREAT Beat.

I love Luda, but IMHO this is NOT his best album. It seems like he just went into the studio, mad, and put down some tracks and said \\"this will be my album\\".

Ludacris changes his whole style on this album with the slow beats and rhymes. Luda was at his best when he was rhyming quick with the fast beats (Word Of Mouf). I couldn't wait for a new Luda album to drop, but after this, I hope he never comes out with another one. What a disappointment. The only reason it gets a two is because their are 2 good songs and that's it. Stand Up is Ludacris' worst song and Blow It Out is right up there with Stand Up.

Don't get me wrong. But this album is kinda annoying. The blow it out yer ass song is hard to listen to and repetitive. The splash waterfalls song is also really redudant, if you heard it on the radio as many times as I did, you might agree. He just talks through too much of this album... instead of rapping.. the beats are kinda weak and repetitive.. there are 3 good songs on this one: Diamonds in the Back, We Got, and Eyebrows Down.

That was hogwash, and it is with deep regret I implore that indeed Chicken N Beer is as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Have been looking forward to this cd for 14 months! It was August of last year when Ludacris was talking about Chicken and Beer from the stage during Anger Management tour. Well, then it was supposed to come out and they kept pushing it back...until now! Guess he kept trying to improve it and finally gave up. This ain't NEARLY as good as his others. Weak beats, weak raps, weak overall energy wise. Stand Up is the catchiest outta 17 tracks and it ain't THAT great. The song with Snoop is just dreadful. Why would Snoop let himself get hooked up w/that track?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ludacris sucks more and more every song","review":"Ludacris is probably the wackest rapper ever.

Ludacris is the worste rapper in the game right now.. and that is why his cd sucks so bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible.","review":"Let's be honest, Ludacris is a terrible rapper. He's only famous because he can say a thousand words in a minute. Unfortunately, he only knows like, 2 words. He only knows about 2 things, getting drunk & having sex. Well, that's all he talks about. It gets kind of old after the first couple of songs. It's CDs like this one that gives southern hip hop a bad rep. The ONLY thing that is DECENT about this CD are the beats. They're good, not even great, but not enough to salvage this terrible CD.If you're a true Ludacris fan (why...?!), you'll like this CD (it's a rip off of his others, just worse), because your ear is accustomed to the garbage, but if you're a true music fan, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"UmM..

Half the music video for Stand Up is poorly and cheaply computer animated because no one wants to put money towards something a computer can do. Well what about Sir-Mix-A-Lot and his video for \\"Baby Got Back\\"? The scene with the inflating buttock was not computer generated. He put effort in his work. Ludacris is another rapper that talks really fast and looks real stupid trying to talk.So take my advice people stay away from this album.

I liked it back in the 1980s, but the Gangsta rap started turning me off to it in the 1990s (though Snoop Dog was alright), and now it's plain awful. There's no message, no attempt at keeping a note (except for women artists), no nothing. And this artist is the worst of the current newbies.I doubt he'll be popular still in 2006...better chance of Vanilla Ice/ Robert Van Winkle staging his comeback.

I listen to all hip hop. And I can say that most of the wack hip hop I hear comes from the mainstream (commercial) side of things.

I a mnot saying this is a bad record but it is a letdown for ludacris fans. Stick along the lines of southern hospitality, saturday, and stand up.

I knew it wouldn't be up to par with Word of Mouf but atleast its better than that DTP Golden Grain which I won't mention anymore.As usual Ludacris is inventive as ever with his rhymes and the beats on some somes are tight.The standout songs are Stand Up, Screwed Up, Hoes In My Room,and Splash Waterfalls.The skits are funny but I think this album needed more songs and probably a few more skits.I like how Ludacris disses that dude Bill O' Reilly in some songs and a song with him and Snoop is always needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I give Him Props for Nailing Bill O'Reily but this Album is","review":"Yikes elsewhere.Ironic that Luda teams up with Snoop Dogg whom I've said for years has been Coasting on a Pop Pass&hasn't challenged Himself in years&is just basically doing better as a Hook Artist than on His Own Albums overall what a waste? Luda has alot of energy like Missy&Busta but like them He goes on wya too long&just runs short on ideas after a while.I Respect His Hustle but I just ain't feeling the Album.But the get back on Bill O'Reily is right on time&Long overdue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Luda Album","review":"After Word of mouf, I couldnt wait for this cd to release. Word of mouf was the best album iv heard. Chicken N'Beer can't even be compared to luda's last joint. Stand up gets old quick . there aint no good beats or nuthin. \\"Diamond in the Back\\" is ok. I havent listened to the cd since I bought it. I'm waitin' for Red Light District to come out. Hopefully, Luda will come through on that. You wont miss out on anythng if ya dont buy this. If you havent already, get Word of Mouf. Thats money well spent. Chicken N' Beer is TRASH."},{"rating":"2","title":"surprising","review":"a lot of people i've talked to didn't like this newest ludacris effort. where in the past i've frowned on his prior albums, this one surprises me with the beat production. we all know luda has crazy flow...but over nice, funky, mellow and thumpin' beats is the changeup and the key for me. splash waterfalls and diamond in the back are the best cuts on the album in my opinion. stand up is solid (who else behind the beats than kanye himself?), and blow it out is impressive...plus, i like the couple of bill o'reilly references (for satirical value)."},{"rating":"2","title":"CHICKEN & BEER","review":"This cd is a good buy but I don't think it's as good as his last cd \\"Stand Up\\" is definately the hottest joint on this cd. But there are definately some good head bangers on there so check it out. If you're a Ludacris fan you will be happy with this buy. In case you have any doubts check the Leak on MTV.com on the release week to hear it for yourself. If you missed the Leak then you will still be satisfied with the buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ludacris back in daffect","review":"I just picked this album up this morning, (...) ....Did you like Ludacris' first cd?

Laterz"},{"rating":"1","title":"what is happening to rap?","review":"I remember the good ole days of Nas, Wu Tang clan, C-Murder, B.G., Kweli, Common, and De La Soul. Unfortunatley rap these days is so poor. I should give Luda credit for being slightly more literate than his protege Chingy, but the subject matter is so utterly trite and uncreative. Why is it OK for modern rappers to degrade their women in abusive and sexist language? Whatever happened to creative and respectul rap?The CD may be summarized in the same way as any modern hip-hop album: A arrogant, selfish man who claims to be from the projects but never gives anything back to his community raps about how many girls he has,blablabla...This music is destructive the the Black race which is in a serious crisis to begin with. Luda has so much popularity that he could put out some positive rap and perhaps influence his community for the better. But inevitably he ends up rapping about nightclubs, guns , and girls. C'mon people, lets bring it back to love and respectful hip-hop."},{"rating":"1","title":"playa like WHAT!?!","review":"Let's just think for a moment, that you, among all your other Marshel-loving trendseeking friends, are sitting here, crying out, \\"Yo, what up in da hood sucka?

Did you ever think that maybe this music is not good, and is actually just another trend to hide behind because your insecurities are too restricting to allow you to think freely and speek with literacy? That's right, MTV and corporate media has found another way to hold the audience captive under the fear of being un-hip, and these talentless people who are actually just spewing out meaningless madeup words, are stealing your money.

N***a has no flow and his lyrical topics are rather sophomoric. People who listen to this obviosly don't like good music and would rather have some prefab phony \\"MC\\" than some real hip hop. I'm so sick of hearing this music classified as \\"hip hop,\\" because it aint. Go pick up some REAL hip hop like MF Doom, Themselves, BDP, MIC, Anticristo (the best hip hop artist EVER) and Dalek.

And they are:Hip Hop QuotablesBlow It OutHoes In My Room (I picked this one only because it was funny)Southern Fried IntroOther than that, this album is weak. Straight up. I listen to all hip hop. And I can say that most of the wack hip hop I hear comes from the mainstream (commercial) side of things. Don't misunderstand, there's some wack underground joints....but not like mainstream.

The cd is so typical, so uninteresting that you don't even need to bother to learn the tracks because they all sound the same.

Why is it that muttering into a microphone like you have had 8 shots of anesthesia your mouth make you an artist? Well Ludacris is a very very very, unartistic and very pointless \\"artist\\". He combines electronic beats, bad lyrics, and an idiodic sounding \\"accent\\" (what an original idea, maybe 50cent should try it) into a very horrible noise that degenerates the human IQ and offends the intelegent.Ludacris is less known for the music he creates, and is better known for the \\"controversy\\" he creates. He is better known for his Parental Advisory label that the albums parade around like an award. This is music at its worst. It is a fact that Ludacris should not be allowed to make any more albums, and should apologize publicly for making people waste their money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Commercial stuff SIGH!

However, I was never moved enough to purchase an entire album until 1994's breakthrough, Amplified Heart. This was followed up by Walking Wounded, and I think the duo has made a graceful entrance into the world of electronic pop music. So being a relatively new fan, I wanted to start building my collection and chose Worldwide. I was fairly disappointed. The album was recorded in 1991 and has an almost eighties, adult contemporary sound. The most recent two albums are better investments and sound more sophisticated. I'm looking forward to a new album, but can't recommend this to less than rabid fans of the group."},{"rating":"2","title":"Calling All Kids...and Grownups","review":"I bought this DVD as a gift for an eight-year-old and decided to \\"preview\\" it first. I was very impressed. The songs (most are original) are cute and catchy and deliver positive messages for children. The visuals - some using animation, some using puppets and others using live action - are very colorful and creative. Roseanne has a voice that is well-suited to this kind of project. The sets and costumes in the live-action numbers are well-done and the variety of music styles (including an Andrews Sisters dance number using very talented kids and grownups) makes for fun viewing. I especially liked \\"Let the Kids Boogie,\\" \\"Calling All Kids,\\" \\"I'm Gonna Tell On You\\" and \\"Don't Do It.\\" Having the choice of watching the DVD with or without singalong lyrics, for those old enough to read, is a good learning tool. I am sure that youngsters will \\"get the message\\" while they are being thoroughly amused and entertained by Rockin' With Roseanne."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad","review":"My husband bought this for $3 and I question if he overpaid.

This book chronicles the trials and struggles of the Scott family and how their faith in God was stretched so far, it eventually snapped. Any one of the severe trials they faced could have destroyed their marriage and family, yet they persevered, even when the burden of enduring one test after another after another wore them down. This book made me grateful that I haven't been confronted with so many difficulties, yet I was amazed to see how their faith in God kept rising to the surface as a strong testimony to others. More than anything, the story glorifies God by showing His love and faithfulness to this family. Well-written and hard to put down, this true story shows that what the enemy meant for evil, God can work for our good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over the Top","review":"This approach to Christmas was not generally to my taste, though several of the cuts were pretty good.

I was utterly disappointed in this CD from an otherwise outstanding group. Their compilation with Sarah is wonderful and I think they tried to capitalize on that. It sounds like they spent about 6 hours in the recording studio and tried to put this album together quickly. I'm all for being spontaneous, but overall, this album sounded horrible.

I have all of their albums and have seen them 3 times in concert this year alone. I bought this album the day it was released. It is terrible! It was recorded last May at Steve's (Page- Lead Singer) farm in Canada. It almost sounds like they were just goofing around and recorded it. I guess they weren't that concerned how bad it was because they knew at least their hard-core fans would buy it. For a band that hasn't exactly been climbing the charts lately, this is inexcusable.

The clever turns of phrase that are BNL trademarks seem very strained here, and the old standards are not particularly good.

This holiday album is the most annoying and lame thing I've ever paid money for! Usually BNL gets away with lame and annoying, but not this time! The few original songs are decent, but all sound so mellow...borderline melancholy. I was excited to see what BNL would do to holiday classics...but they killed them.

Sadly, I wasn't expecting this one to end up between to \\"A Froggy Christmas\\" and \\"Steel Drum Island Christmas.\\"The wit, singing and spunk just ain't to be found.

We ordered it and was very disappointed that we did notlike more than a couple of their songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!","review":"If you enjoy slightly off kilter Christmas music, you will probably enjoy this offering by Barenaked Ladies. Mixed between beautiful songs like Hanukkah Blessings and Do They Know It's Christmas are tunes like Elf's Lament which never fails to make me smile, laugh, tap my toe and bounce around in my chair at work.I'm not excited about all of the tracks, but the ones I love, I really love and since that is at least 50% of the disc, I'm happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"Being a big BNL fan, I couldn't resist picking up this CD. However, I am really not impressed. Some of the song are just a littly too hokey (\\"Happy Birthday to Jesus\\"??) making the Ladies' usual comedic wit seem just plain childish. For some reason Steven tried to use an octave on \\"Jingle Bells\\" that was just a little high out of his range, and you can hear him struggle. The \\"casio bassanova\\"s made me feel like I was in an elevetor at the mall. Sorry - just not up to the usual high-standard of BNL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"I bought this because I love the \\"we three kings/god rest ye\\" song. Really should have listened to the rest. Was expecting a few recognizable songs...the ones that were they weren't singing...instrumental. Very blah"},{"rating":"1","title":"They knocked it out in a couple of days","review":"I am a BNL fan but I don't plan to listen to this album twice. The quirkiness of this band is just plain irritating in songs like Jingle Bells and Stills Christmas. It's not even clever. I wish I would have listened to some cuts before I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just phoning it in :(","review":"What a sad disappointment this was. I gave it as a gift to my daughter. We adore the Ladies. From the first chord of the first track-- a slow-as-molasses-in-January dirge of 'Jingle Bells,' it's obvious that these guys are just phoning it in-- creating a holiday (and it is a 'holiday' album: Christmas, Chanukka, etc.) album to cash in on our sentimental holiday feelings. This album sounds like the guys spent all day Christmas feasting and drinking, and then decided to record themselves fiddling around with one of their kids' keyboards. They didn't even edit out mistakes, like Sarah MacLaughlin singing past the end of the song in 'God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen.' Do not waste your money on this disappointment; I know that they have since had to kick their lead singer out for a drug problem; I have a feeling that this album was while they were still enabling him because he probably needed the cash to support his drug habit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Has a very amateurish, unpolished sound. Not what I was expecting based on the one song played so frequently on the Christmas Music Radio Stations. If I'd listened to the CD prior to purchase I wouldn't have wasted my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barenaked for the Holidays","review":"I totally love the song, God Rest Ye Merry Gentleman/We Three Kings and Carol of the Bells, the remainder of the CD isn't that great. I thought for sure I'd love almost every song, but unfortunately I only listen to the two songs mentioned above."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"I think my ears are bleeding! This was obviously done for the money. The only halfway decent track is \\"God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen\\"(with Sarah McLachlan). \\"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\\" is a synthesized nightmare that sounds like it should be played while the Zamboni cleans the ice at a hockey game. The same goes for \\"O Holy Night\\". Track 12, \\"The Carol of the Bells\\", is as repetative and annoying as the Twilight Zone theme! There are no bells-only that cheezy keyboard again. The Barenaked version of Bob Geldof's \\"Do They Know It's Christmas?/Feed The World\\" is even WORSE than the original (yes, it's possible). It's so bad that my kids called it elevator music! These \\"artists\\" have shown their Barenaked backsides with this CD!If you want a GOOD Holiday album with a twist, try something by The Brian Setzer Orchestra instead (they use REAL instruments)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fans, don't waste your money","review":"I have been a BNL fan from the pre-Gordon days, and religiously attended their Christmas shows in the Detroit area before they 'made it big' in the U.S., and I was really excited for this album, which was a tremendous disappointment. All the songs sound like they were recorded in an elevator with a couple of Casios instead of instruments. Having seen BNL perform live with Sarah McLachlan, I was horrified to learn that their live duet of \\"God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen\\" was apparently not re-recorded for the studio version. It sounds like they just took out the arena crowd noise. The song just cuts off at the end; no fade or anything. I loaned this cd to three hardcore fans and none of them could stomach it. I wish I had listened to the audio samples on this website before shelling out money for this cd on the assumption that I would love it because I love the band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Holy Mother of God - turn off this racket!","review":"I've been a fan of BNL since their inception, and while some of their latest tracks haven't quite won my heart, I never expected to find myself as repulsed by an album as I am with this pathetic effort. Not only are the songs cheesy and uninspired, the vocals are mediocre and the production is awful. It sounds more like a elementary school's holiday concert than an album by a once-great band.Seems to me like they're less concerned with jingling bells than they are the change jingling in their pockets. This is the ULTIMATE sell out - no need to bother with a Box Set anymore.I love you, boys, but COME ON!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this hurts my ears","review":"so sad, being that I love bnl.. but this one should have not been released and perhaps saved as stocking stuffers for their grandparents who could possibly conjure some taste for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Time Flop","review":"I've been a BNL fan since their first releases of Gordon and Maybe You Should Drive. I bought this CD and was COMPLETELEY disappointed. I have to agree with others that have reviewed this CD. Stay clear!! Save your money. You aren't missing a thing...sad to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"Barenaked Ladies' first Christmas album is pretty good. The best songs are the traditional carols that BNL have \\"sillied\\" up. For instance, in \\"Jingle Bells\\" they've changed one verse to the old kids' favorite: \\"Batman smells, Robin laid an egg...\\" There's also a funny rendition of \\"Deck the Halls\\" in which the only lyrics are \\"Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young\\" repeated over and over again. There is also a track in which the band sings \\"Happy Birthday\\" to Jesus. My only complaint is that the original songs written by BNL aren't as great as the traditional carols, and don't really sound much like Christmas songs. But all in all, the album has enough BNL fun to satisfy any fan of the band."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Holiday CD","review":"I have to admit I'm a little biased, having seen BNL 6 times so far this year, with 7 & 8 coming up next week. That being said, there are some great songs on this cd. And it is a true \\"holiday\\" cd as it has 3 songs for Hanukkah, including a very sweet song written by Steve called \\"Hanukkah Blessings\\". My other favorite is the Ed penned tune \\"Elf's Lament\\". As for the rest, I love the quirkyness of many of the songs. I've seen some other reviewers comment on the quality of the recording. All I can say is it sounds great in my car, and from my home theater system. If you are a true BNL fan, you will like this disc. If you are new to BNL, this gives a great flavor for what they are like live, quirky yet musical. I can't stop listening to it :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious, what else would you expect?","review":"This is a Christmas CD for people who enjoy fun Christmases (if that's word!). In typical BNL fashion it is bright, happy, uptempo, and extremely fun to listen to if you're a BNL fan. For those non-BNL fans, some of the songs may bother you because they're not the way you're used to hearing the typical Christmas songs. The original songs on this album are just so-so, which is why I give it only 4 stars, but then again every rock/pop/mainstream artist who makes a Christmas album fills it up with so-so new Christmas songs which I doubt anyone actually listens to annually.The reason to buy this CD is if you're a Barenaked Ladies fan and you want to hear what they do to some of your old Christmas faves. They make 'em fun and enjoyable so I recommend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"something for everyone","review":"Great mix of classics, original songs, and whimsical ditties. Elf's Lament is a must listen and should become a classic in it's own right!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tunes","review":"I'm still enjoying thee music on Valentine's Day! I'd buy their music now more than ever. Our adult children like them too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Track 1 alone sold me on this album","review":"This is a fun Christmas album. I wouldn't take it home to Grandma, as it isn't the typical Christmas fare, but as a fan of BNL, I really enjoy this. Track 1, Jingle Bells, sold me alone. It begins with a very serious, somber version of the song, then leads into delightful refrains of Batman smells, etc. It also mixes in several Hanukkah songs, including Hanukkah Blessings and I Have a Little Dreidel. Some of the songs are pure silliness, while others, like God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen, are serious and traditional songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"great music","review":"I love the music on the CD, and it plays well. I just wish the original CD cover had been included."},{"rating":"2","title":"A powerful book!","review":"I've read this and Guthrie's other books countless times. The power and history of the story have yet to disappoint me. Guthrie captures the people, the times, and the \\"feel\\" of the west as no other author has. I grew up in the area where much of Guthrie's story takes place. When I need a dose of home, all I have to do is reread one of his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Sky Decent book OK movie.","review":"Some of the terms in the book are not PC now, and a little hokey when he tries to write about \\"romance\\".But I still remember how \\"un-Hollywood\\" Gutherie's writing was when I first read it in the 50,s. The film sort of sucks, Kirk Douglas was too old for the roll, but Arthur Lee Hunnicut the actor who tells the story just sounds like the salt of the earth, although I think he was trained on the east coast Then there is the black and white, the film crew goes on location in a great place and shoots in back & white.If you go to upper Montana, along the Missouri, (where the tourists don't go), you'll find a little town with the original boat on display in the park. Read the book, then see the movie if you must.If you like this kind of book you may be interested in \\"The Revenant\\" by Michael Punke, \\"based\\" on a true story."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome book !!","review":"Really Good Classic that captures the mood and times of the Rocky Mountain Fur Trade Era, including some tidbits about the \\"Rivermen\\" and their way of life.Reading this book will inspire you to read more of \\"Guthries\\" works, he writes inan appealing and easy going style that makes the pages fly by, you will not be disappointed if you like this \\"era\\" of history."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great old epic","review":"I bought this book for my son who is 26 and he just loved it. It is a great man's adventure but I sure loved it also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comtemporary Jazz","review":"This CD put Bob Baldwin on the road to being my favorite Comtemporary/Smooth Jazz keyboardist. His arrangements and execution are exciting and so pleasing to hear. Lots of finesse and fire in his work. If you like this also get \\"[...]\\". You collection will thank you for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I've been satisfied with the earbuds that came with my Creative Zen Nano Plus MP3 player. But I noticed the great ratings assigned these Coby earbuds and the low price, so thought I'd give them a try. They arrived today and what a disappointment! I think they sound terrible. They're described as \\"Super bass\\". But compared to what? Two tin cans connected by kite string? They are inexpensive and for good reason. Cheap, tinny sound. I wasn't expecting a $100 performance, but given all the stars in the rating, I thought they'd sound better than this! Sorry folks, but this Review Forum let me down on this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too big","review":"These were too big for me... would not fit in my ears. I think they're a size large. I had to give them to my husband."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Coby's are complete junk","review":"The Coby's are complete junk. First the cable frayed near the jack, then the jack itself came loose and then broke off. Not to mention the tips always fall off. I eventually lost one, making them utterly useless.I've had terrible experiences with earbuds from Coby, Skullcandy, and V-Moda. I would recommend avoiding Coby and trying something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"unexpected","review":"I had gotten these on amazon ...glad they werent real expensive..throughout all of the descriptions it was never once mentioned that in tiny little print on the package that the wires contain lead and to wash your hands after every use. My child listens to her books on a cd player ..one of the reasons for this purchase..wouldnt recommend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good earphones","review":"I like this better then the conventional earphones, because they sit right in your ear. They don't hurt me the way the old style did."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"I had these earphones for about 1.5 years when the one side stopped working completely; for under $6, I shouldn't be too surprised. When they were working the sound was okay, although they were a little too bass-heavy for my taste. The noise isolation wasn't nearly as good as other earphones, like the Sennheiser CX300 which I replaced them with. I suppose as a result of the poor noise isolation, the one advantage of the Coby pair was they didn't produce much noise when you move the cord."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},W=["disabled"],x={key:0},N={key:1};function H(i,e,s,u,r,n){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",C,[(a(!0),o(y,null,f(n.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(a(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),n.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>n.loadMore&&n.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),o("span",N,"Loading...")):(a(),o("span",x,"See more"))],8,W)):b("",!0)])}const M=d(O,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-3c98d65f"]]),R=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/1.md","filePath":"people/1.md"}'),F={name:"people/1.md"},L=Object.assign(F,{setup(i){return(e,s)=>(a(),o("div",null,[v(M)]))}});export{R as __pageData,L as default};
