I would recommend this to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carnival Games (Wii) is Good Entertainment","review":"I'm very happy with the product. Like all the Wii games, this is interactive and gets you off the couch and moving around unlike other console games. It's intuitive, easy to learn and a fun game - especially if there are more than just one person playing. Highly recommended for everyone of all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carnival WII Game","review":"Really fun games on the disc. My four year old can play almost all of the games. Made for smaller children and not teens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted to like it, but... didn't.","review":"I've only ever purchased mini-game titles for the wii and about half have been disappointments and this is one of them. It offers a bunch of games and half are playable more than a few times. Had they just focused on 8-10 classic carnival games and really developed the interaction and playability, this probably would have been a better game. Instead its just a bunch of games that most people will soon tire of. Maybe small children would enjoy it, but kind of a bore for teens and older."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun","review":"This game has been lots of fun for all members of the family. The youngest at age 5 can participate and have as much fun as the older members. Some of the games require practice to master, but they are not so hard that they are impossible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for all ages","review":"This game was kinda fun for me (being 25) and my nephew (who is 5). It was a little easy in some games, but a bit tricky in others. Not my favorite Wii game but it is fun to play when I have a day off from work and the weather is to nasty to leave the house. My nephew had a hard time getting into it but once he did he had fun. I mainly bought it for when my neice and nephew come to my house to keep them ammused and they seem to enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wii got it right!","review":"My 5 year old LOVES this game.

The graphics are okay, but the games are really fun and its kind of addictive. Worth every penny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great game","review":"This game is very cool and passes the time away. All the games you can think of are in in this game. It is pretty realistic using the wii remote to throw and shoot. It is fun to play by yourself or with a friend playing head to head. The only thing is when you unlock games they are the same games but something in it just to make it a little harder.Over all it is a great game to buy.It makes you use the wii remote in alot of different ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, what a disappointment!","review":"We received a few new games for the Wii this Christmas, and while some were great, this was the biggest disappointment to all of us. Users in our household are ages 7, 10, 13, 15, and two parents. It is a rare day when we all agree, but we did- no one liked this game. The visuals were gaudy and ugly and the games were either too easy or difficult to the point that no one wanted to keep trying. We expected fun games that all could play. Instead we got a game that will be quickly traded in for something worthwhile. I wish it could get 0 stars, because that's what I would rate it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How could people rate this 5 stars? How even 3?","review":"Controls are iffy, and in some cases bad. Silly/useless \\"prizes\\". Can't use Mii (have to make a new character, just so you can win prizes to outfit them). Wildly variable toughness in the games - many are simply pure luck (ok, that's not too out of character, but usually there's at least the *illusion* of skill mattering in a carnival) or simply don't work well. Poor graphics.I may never bother trying all the games after trying out 10 or so. Worst: the football toss. Best: perhaps the horse race; at least the controls seem to mostly work there. But \\"best\\" is not strong praise here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Game!!","review":"This game goes like this...- Select a game,- Wait 30 seconds for game to load,- Play for 30 seconds,- Wait 30 seconds for \\"prizes\\",- Wait 30 seconds for game to load ...There is a lot of waiting and not much playing. And when you do finally get to play, either you can't figure it out because it's not intuitive or the playability is awful.Save your money.

For example, we could not use the second Wii remote for player 2 and had to keep swapping the first remote between players. The backgound music is annoying and drives you crazy after a while. I also do not understand why they make you create your own player characters instead of using your existing Mii's.The kids asked me turn it off after 20 minutes so they could play something else. Very disappointing and not worth $50."},{"rating":"1","title":"More mini games for the wii!","review":"This reminds me of the time I went to the carnival all those years ago for my eighth birthday. The ferris wheel was broken, the roller coaster went at a snail's pace, and the hot dog I ate made me vomit all over my mom (true story). This is a collection of mini-games for the Wii, set in a carnival. That sounds like fun, doesn't it? With over 25 mini-games, you'd think this game would be a decent purchase. You'd be wrong. Of the games I played (and I played all but two), half of them played completely broken (football throw), another fourth had decent gameplay but completely mindless (ring toss), and one-fourth of the games had some fun elements to them (balloon darts). The \\"customizable options\\" at the beginning of the game will make you yearn for your Miis, and the graphics are nothing to write home about. I wouldn't reccomend this to anyone except someone who has absolutely no other party game to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"I don't see how anyone could rate this 5 stars. We rented this game for my 5 year old and the entire family grew bored of in within a few minutes.

For example, in dunk tank, insted of aming you wait for a target to hit the right spot, and then you throw. Also, the games get kind of boring after you play them all twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted to Like It...","review":"Based on all the positive reviews, I really wanted to like this game. It's just that this game is completely shallow and mediocre at best. It was moderately entertaining for about the first 30 minutes or so and then gets extremely dull after that. On top of it all, you are awarded \\"virtual\\" prizes. That's pretty lame unless you're extremely bored or a tyke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun for a little while and for groups","review":"Carnival Games has more than 20 minigames, each of which are pretty fun. But, they get dull quickly. You figure out the motions and timing you need and thereafter it's too easy to beat the games. The only benefit to this game once you have it down is that you can beat your friends! But, the control use is awkward; for most minigames, you have to take turns playing the game alone. My husband is very impatient, so one round of this game was too much waiting around for him to handle. I would suggest that you rent this game sometime when you have people over, but since it lacks replayability, I don't suggest buying it.Other notes: You can play with a lot of people, since you take turns. You only need the wiimote to play -- no extra controllers needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wii Carnival...not that good!","review":"With so many games out there, I try to go by the ratings.First, the games were slow to go then not very easy to use and reaction times were very slow and hard to use. I have to admit, they put a lot of work into this but not worth it at all.Maybe I'm new to the Wii but after all the work, why do you have to create a new Mii for this game. That sucks!Can't take it back so hopefully a good Ebay item!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I purchased this game because I thought my 4 & 7 year olds would enjoy it. All three of us found the games pretty tedious and boring. There's more to making your character than there is to the various games.Try Mario Karts or Wipeout for more action, adventure, and fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Everyone...","review":"We received this game as a gift. This game is not for everyone. These games are difficult to play and it seems to cheat. The commentator is verbally mean. If you're not good at the game, he'll let you know.

I have a three year old and the some of the games are a bit advanced for him but he doesn't like the game anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carnival","review":"Found out after playing this,it wasn't what we wanted. It's aimed more at the younger generation{we're in our mid 50's}. We traded it for Wii International Winter Sports.It would be a good one for kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Modern Day Slavery","review":"I do not understand how this game lets you edit a person but you cannot change the skin tone of your character. You can have fairytale elephant feet and ridiculous antler horns but you can ony play as a caucasion person. It is the 21st century and this game still has not gotten with the program.At first I shrugged it off unitl I started noticing the ring leader was always white and the carni who had to work the booths was black; in every game though. the only black people in the games are carni rode people. So they did have the technology to create people of color but chose to only feature them as modern day slaves!!!If I had not bought this racist game used from Game stop I would have taken it back the same day."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK GAME","review":"This is the worst game I've ever played. i thought it would be good for get togethers and it is horrible. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooooring and confusing","review":"Not a fan of this game. The menus are not intuitive and therefore the games are very difficult to navigate -- you have to pick a \\"section\\" of the park to go to but there is no indication of what sections house which games.Then once you are playing the games... they are... underwhelming at best.It's nice & tame game for little kiddos but really uninspired and... well... boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"Bought it to play with the wife and kids. Can't play it nearly as easily as many other titles. Poorly laid out, non-intuitive game play. And the set design (redneck) is just crass"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of bad discs that freeze up your Wii","review":"I was very excited to get this game, especially so that my friends and I had something to play other than Wii Sports. We popped the disc and many of the games certainly seemed like fun. Unfortunately, the game constantly freezes, requiring me to restart the Wii by holding down the power button (the Reset button will not work). It always happens either when I'm choosing an area to go to (like Rodent Way, Fortune Way, etc.) or when I'm quitting a game to go back to the area I was in. Sometimes there is a loud screeching noise, which isn't pleasant on the ears.Overall, the games are fun to play...when they work. But the constant freezing means that this game is going back to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not perfect for every age","review":"Being an adult gamer I found this game to be a bit boring and too repetitive as many game are quite similar to one another. Then having my nieces play (age 7 & 9) they found the games too difficult and had a hard time staying interested. It's an ok game but over priced for the amount of time actually spent playing and it seems like the appropriate age group that will truly enjoy it is hard to pin down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak, shallow and buggy","review":"Based largely on the previous positive reviews on Amazon, I picked this title up. I was in for a negative surprise. The controls are difficult to pick up and very arbitrary, the game crashes at random points (definite game problem, my wii has a lot of mileage and has only crashed on this game) and even when you've \\"mastered\\" the controls, the game really isn't even that fun. It forces you to create your own character with their weak character design application (why not just import the miis? or let people quick start as guest? too easy?). There are plenty of other good minigame games out there for the Wii (Rayman Raving Rabbids & WarioWare, to name the better ones) and plenty of other great games either out or coming out on the Wii (Mario Galaxy, Metroid, Zelda, RE4, Zack & Wiki, Medal of Honor: Heroes 2, Super Paper Mario, etc) and this isn't one you should waste your time or money on."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORRRRING!!!!! Save your money","review":"I bought this game with our new wii. IN a nutshell it's slow and borring. Were family type gamers, with a 7 year old girl. It's not interesting enough. Playground is a much better choice it's rated E and is action packed. We rented and have played non-stop for hours. Hope this is helpfull I was shocked at the good rating carnival received."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great in theory, awful in practice","review":"What a great idea: take the fun of the carnival home! Fun for all ages, right? Throw a beanbag at the milk pails, toss a softball into the bushel, the dunk tank, etc. The problem is that the controls are so inappropriate that the minigames feel like random chance. For example, in the dunk tank game, instead of simply aiming for the target, you have to wait while a dot spins around, then time your throw to coincide with the dot appearing on the bullseye. Then the smarmy commentators make some wisecrack that you don't know what you're doing. This game gives me much greater appreciation for Wii Sports and Warioware. Returned this game to the store after about an hour. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Fun At All","review":"I was expecting carnival type games without the sleazy carnival cheating to keep you from winning the game. It is cumbersome to move from game to game. First you have to select an alley to visit, then you pick a game, then you have to listen to instructions on how to play. I'm not that patient. You can create you own on screen person but you can only be white, at least when you first start the game. I would not recommend unless your are trying to get you kids to read more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good family fun!","review":"Was looking for good family games for all ages to play together and glad to report this one kept an 11 yr old, 17 yr old and 3 adults all playing together for a full evening of fun and believe me if it kept the 17 yr old out of her room and off the cell for 3 hours then it has to be good. We all enjoyed it and we are looking forward to more great family game nights!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Carnival Games","review":"I played around in this for about 1/2 hour one evening. I didn't have that much fun and haven't played again since. I had a hard time getting the remote to work well with the games. It seemed a little off.Now wii sport and wii fit keep me entertained and I play those alot."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of games to choose from!","review":"This Wii game is made up of tons of mini games. It's great for kids that have short attention spans and want to try a lot of different things. Not so great for kids that like to start a game that progresses and has levels. I found that it leads to arguments between my kids with choosing which game they are going to play since they are so short. Some of the games are easy enough for my 4 yr old to play and others are a little tricky, but overall I'd say that it's good for all ages, even young ones. My 10 yr old only plays this when she has to play something that her brother can play with her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to Play","review":"Bought this game to have something for my grandchildren, ages 3 - 10, to play.

There are several games that I like to play in \\"real life\\" and it's great that I have the option to play them in my living room. My only problem I have with this game is some of the games are a bit difficult to maneuver with the wii remote this maybe due to my lack of experience however. If you are looking for a game the whole family will enjoy and are short and sweet then this game is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A few glitches but a fun game, especially for kids!","review":"We just got this and have played most of the games. Individual games aren't as long or challenging as Wii Sports but some of them are quite fun and it's a great game for kids. The main problem we notice is that some of the games that require a soft underhand throw don't seem to translate to the game very well and just like real carnival games some seem like the odds are so stacked against you that it can get frustrating. For the price (around $[...]) I would still recommend it. Great game for the holidays if you'll have a bunch of kids or kids at heart around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprised to see so many good reviews...","review":"Seems like a lot of people really like this game, but I don't care for it.Takes a long time to master controls, but no real pay off once you do, becuase the games are not that interesting.Weak character designSlow to start and change gamesI DO like other short, mini-game style games on the Wii, including Rayman Rabbids (1 and 2), Wario Ware, and even Wii Play.Since there seems to be a real split in reviews, I suggest people to rent/borrow/buy used to avoid a let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amusing, But Lacking","review":"I saw the five-star reviews here, and so I decided to give Carnival Games a try.Boy was I disappointed. There are quite a few mini-games, but only a select few are fun to play - the rest are frustrating. Most of them are very finicky, and the animation is quite sub-par. Unlike Wii Play Games, Carnival Games lack replayability.Do yourself a favor - rent it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Controls NOT ACCURATE + Limited movements + Graphic looks colorful but the games are boring","review":"The controls are NOT ACCURATE. I can't adjust my aim. The movements are limited. As a result, a lot of times, I lost because of the control not because of my skill. Most of the games play almost the same. For example, you either throw balls, or throw rings. It's boring. Circus Games is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed.","review":"I purchased this game for my family based on the reviews on this site and I must say that I am very disappointed with this game. My family and I enjoyed games like Wii play and Wii sports and believed this game to be the same based on the reviews on this site. However, this game was a major let down. With this game your characters are limited. In fact, you cannot create ethnic characters only caucasian ones. Apart from that, the only games that my family and I enjoyed were skee-ball, hoops and the power hit game.... I plan on taking this lame game back to the GameStop first thing tomorrow and exchanging it for the \\"PlayGround\\" game ... For all those who are considering purchasing this game know this, if you enjoyed Wii play or Wii sports --- This game does not compare....

I was expecting it to be faster, something new, and exciting, kind of like Rayman or the mini games on Wario Smooth Moves. If you like the games at the carnival then you will probably like this one. I thought it was addicting but at the same time it was boring. Maybe I was expecting the games to have a new twist to the traditional games at the real carnival, but not so.

I think this game is great for a crowd of people because there really is something for everyone.The graphics are good, and the controller is easy to use for these games. You will find games you are good at. As you play the games, extra levels are available to enhance the games. This is a really nice touch, so you don't get bored with any one of the games too soon.

Something with a fast learning curve. That's what this is. The unpopular games in the set are the games that aren't skill based (tossing balls into milk jugs) and the ones where you have to shake the remote vigorously (strong man) but the shooting ones, tossing ones, etc... have been a big hit. With about 40 games to choose from, there is likely to be something everyone will like. The duck shooting is my favorite. Mostly, we just enjoy being able to have 4 people playing and the fact that everyone can jump right in and figure it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"It is very enertaining my son (who is 5) and I have a great time playing the game.

These should be called micro-mini games as your turn is over with so fast, then it's a stop down. To me, this is Wii's biggest downfall. Too many mini games with way too much stop down. While there are over 25 games in here, you spend 2/3 of your time just moving between menu's and game loading and only 1/3 playing. The games are almost all pure dumb luck too, which I guess is pretty much how all carnival games are, but just not as much fun throwing virtual coins at plates and virtual rings at bottles, etc. Great idea for a fun interactive game, just poorly executed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusually smooth, but ambient!","review":"This is a smooth and atmospheric recording; oddly missing is rugged and sharply edged Prokofiev, but still present is the dissonance and atonality.

I was able to put together the main part in about 15 minutes. Getting the top on, however, took almost TWO HOURS! The holes for the screws were not of appropriate size, and were intended, like the sides, to allow for deeper gripping. Unlike the sides, though, the pieces to the top were much much deeper, and so, after trying every possible scenario to get them in, the screws had to be pounded into the wood. I had to set up the bookcase upside down on thick layers of cardboard to pound the screws in sufficiently. I used a very short philips screwdriver and a hammer to pound them in. The tool that came with the bookcase was so very insufficient. All told, I finally had to get someone as getting the top shelf on the bookcase was a two-person job. When I finally got it put together, the whole thing wobbled. I'm so disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I purchased this bookcase based on the reviews I read.

We started off only ordering one unit because of this and it ended up fine. Due to this, we ordered two more... huge mistake. The first shelf got a major crack on the top shelf. It's so big, it runs across half the piece. If you look closely, you can tell that the wood was weak to begin with.The second shelf was even worse. 3 of the pieces had cracks to begin with that were painted over with the finish.Unless you want to waste your money, do not order this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check you parts before assembly!","review":"I was excited about buying a small bookshelf for my spare bedroom.

WOW","review":"I bought this model and 3 of the tall ones because i loved the description and they truly are beautiful when they are finally assembled.Two things i would like to mention which are the reasons why i cut a star off is one that the screws for the top shelf especially are not conveniently located because you cannot do a full turn with the allen key.The other is that the top isn't really made specifically for the bookshelf you get in the box so it might kind of seem off a bit but at the end of the day the simple fact that i was able to get REAL wood in the US has made me extremely happy and for the price hands down its a great deal all around!!I would definitely recommend and buy this again..:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Happy...","review":"I liked the design, the color and the fact that it is in wood.

But not too happy :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk furniture at a mid-range furniture price","review":"About the only thing worse than the finish on this is the wood the finish was put on. The wood is cheesy and loaded with nicks, chips and cracks. It kind of looks like \\"distressed\\" furniture, only it's not supposed to. Two of four shelves split when I started to run in the provided screws. One shelf split half its length. Rather that diassemble the whole thing and ship it back just to receive a probably even worse one, I epoxied and clamped the shelf pieces together while I put in the screw. Seriously, when the wooden shelf weighs less than the screws you are attaching it with, you should probably throw it away and put in a good piece of wood. Quality control at Winsome Wood is obviously non-existent. One star is generous, all considered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"What a piece of garbage.

But it's not what I expected quality wise. Due to time constraints, I did not send it back, I turned it upside down, I still get the use of 4 shelves, and it DOES function as a bookcase, (hence the 2 star review). But buyer beware, you need to check each piece as dings seem to be the regular case with this item. There is a chance if you have the time, you'll need to send it/parts back.

While I was station-dito there were more than several instances of Filipine Marine or locals and Navy or marine sentries shooting each other and worse.

My advice, take the $4.00 rental fee you would have paid to see this movie and just send it right to me as an advance thank you for saving you the time and frustration of having to sit through this train wreck, or you may want to send me the $50.00 replacement fee you would have been charged from taking out your twelve gage to use this piece of garbage as skeet shooting practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor translation from the German","review":"I *think* this is actually quite a good book in the original German, but the English translation is a joke -- almost bad enough to appear as if done by a computer.

I began to work on scribing my countertop and got about 3/4s of the way done when I began to smell something hot or burning. I stopped the sander, noticed that the belt had slipped over into the plastic casing and begun to cut into it. Now I have an unfinished scribing project and a waste of $60. Guess I learned my lesson.

Other than that, he is a failure as a channeler of electronic energy (DJ). This CD, as all other CDs in this series, is extremely commercial, overly mixed (same beat drawn out too long) and quite repetitive. There is nothing underground about it!!! If you want compilations of the same old songs that are played out, the ones you keep hearing everywhere you go, yes, fellow partier, those same songs you already own, probably several times over, on all your other CDs, then be my guest. Personally, I'd recomend something like Gatecrasher's Immerse Yourself, which is a 2 CD compilation of less commercial yet still somewhat popular songs. If you do want a CD of popular trance and techno songs, get Trance Party instead, it is a much better mix. If you have good house/progressive suggestions for me, something not repetitive or commercial, not empty or boring (...)

There was language, but really none of it was used out of context. Elise and David had a relationship that I imagine many partners start with and end up with. It all seemed very real to me. I had realistic expectations, and boy was I not disappointed. I had some clue as to the basic ending of this book, but I was totally surprised by the particulars.

Set in the wonderfully creepy but dripping with southern charm, Savannah, the plot involves two detectives with complicated pasts working the case of a psychotic killer who leaves his victims dead but alive (you'll have to read to book to understand that one). The pasts of the detectives and the killer's obsession with death intersect and make the story well rounded.

I think the problem is that there is only one moveable cutter (under your thumb) that is used to press against the other cutters and I can't generate enough pressure with my thumb against just that one cutter to cut the foil. I press and turn and press and turn and it scores the foil but doesn't cut through. You need more leverage to get the job done. Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"It workes well and I know because I own a winery were we open bottles all day long.

This album shows that there is more to the artist than a Lady in Red! It highlights the story telling and rocker abilities of the artist as well as is talent for writing beautiful love songs. For those who already have most of these songs, it's worthwhile getting just for the track \\"There's A New Star Up In Heaven Tonight\\".

The music is well suited to the lyrics and leaves a \\"cannot forget the melody\\" as the take away from listening.2. \\"Lady in Red\\" - My reason for purchasing the cd. Again, the lyrics and melody make this an all time favorite dance and sing along tune. So much emotion is conveyed and is truly a classic.3. \\"Borderline\\" - With the war in Iraq, this is a \\"now\\" tune even though written years ago. The sentiment is so emotionally filling .. one cannot get away from the haunting melody. Comment: Seems there are several tunes on this cd that mirror the melody of \\"Borderline\\". A bit repetitious but nonetheless haunting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let this star shine","review":"I just received my copy of this incredible CD. A great compilation of Chris greatest hits such as \\"Dont pay the ferryman\\" or \\"The lady in red\\" but also some terrific songs not known by a great public in the US and Canada. Indispensable for his fans - not only because of the previously unpublished tribute to Diana, Princess of Wales.

NWW is not really an \\"experimental\\" band in the sense that record stores use, and certainly not an \\"industrial\\" band in any sense of the word. What they are is surrealist, the only truly surrealist band with a sizable catalogue. I'm reviewing this one because this is the easiest one to start with. Culled from leftover sounds, supposedly, these tracks are funny, short, easy to listen to (for NWW) and in total a refreshing departure from the wasteland of \\"experimental\\" music. It's not dark and hard, or explosive, or filled with angst. It's not performed by people who can't play any instruments (though Steven Stapleton hasn't always known how to play, much), it's not Throbbing Gristle or Neubauten. It is fun.

Bobby Marchan had one major hit of his own (excluding his work with Huey Smith and the Clowns) which was the 2-part \\"There Is Something on Your Mind,\\" and on this CD, part 1 sounds as though it was transferred from very scratchy vinyl. When you hear the scratches at the beginning of the song, you won't want to listen to the others. After all, this song is the reason most people would buy the CD in the first place.My advice is to forget this CD and wait for a clean issue.The Collectable label currently releases top-quality product (at least the ones I have purchased,) but this one was released before their products were consistently high.If you purchase this CD anyway, you have been warned what to expect."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is the bomb","review":"This Cd Is so tight.

This Makita sander does a good job with final sanding chores, as long as you are outdoors or don't care about noise and dust.

For the money spent, this sander has been a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"low noise??","review":"Review said low noise, low vibes....maybe they did not pack the padded gloves and ear muffs in the case. It is horrible. besides down time to load is a joke unless in the last 2 years makita come up with a better solution to the spring tabs. I shutter every time I need to sand an inside corner to something. I do not like it, never have liked it, and never will like it. If you need one go to a store or trade show and buy one that is quieter with less vibration. TRY IT BEFORE YOU BUY IT. I do not use it unless I absolutely have no choice. As for dust collection anything is better than nothing. My suggestion to avoiding the dust....don't use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Busy buzzy","review":"I don't usually write negitative reviews, but I really don't like this sander too much. It does the job okay, but it vibrates too much and is too noisy.It also doesn't feel good in my hand. The Porter Cable #330 speed bloc is such a nice sander that I don't understand why anyone would want any thing else. (I'm not just loyal to Porter Cable, I like a lot of things that Makita makes)Also, I didn't find the dust collecton feature worth using. It gets some of the dust, but I didn't feel like it was worth taking the time to poke holes in the sandpaper with the little tool (provided) for no more good than it did. I'm only saying this because I know that Makita can make more refined tools. Thank you"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sands well, but not durable","review":"This finish sander just isn't up to Makita's standards. It works well when new, but lacks durability. Even in a non-professional setting, it just doesn't last. The clamps that hold the paper can work loose and are a major pain to get back in place. The level of vibration will also increase in fairly short order. It does sand well, I just wish it was more solidly built. If you need a solid finish sander, you're better off looking at the Porter-Cable or Dewalt models."},{"rating":"2","title":"Celtic Wicca","review":"Very well-written and informative. I enjoyed the book very much, and found the history of the Celtic gods and goddesses, with their complimentary rituals, to be especially good.

The Dewalt jig saws took such a beating from customer reveiws on this web site,so i really never even considerd them. I have used Bosch in the past,and it is a very nice jig saw. I took my time looking over the Makita saw before buying it,i liked the balance and feel of it. It took a couple of minutes to figure out the blade locking system,but now it is second nature. The saw cuts very well,its easy to follow the line,dust is not a problem at all,and it has power to spare.

Imagine trying to think that the earth was round! Or that the sun revolved around the earth. And people thinking that since you did not agree with the current mode of thought, that you were indeed crazy!I think this book had a lot of bearing on my growing more into not being afraid to think along different lines.

Thus, these origins do not go back to the ancient Greeks or even to Ptolemy. The book does, however, cover Newton, which many books on the origins of science neglect because they stop the story well short of the 17th century.The book covers Copernicus and the development of the theory of gravitation. It also covers the study of the heart and general topics such as the history of the Philosophe Movement during the reign of Louis XIV, the place of the scientific revolution in the history of western civilization and the scientific revolution in chemistry. I particularly liked the section of gravitation as it covered the precursors to Newton and how Newton built on their work.This book should be of most interest to those interested in the history of science, as opposed to a general audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"aftertaste","review":"Very difficult to swallow despite being so small....

In order to save herself and her brother, Melayne must confront forces much stronger than her Talent--tempests of magic, desire, and betrayal. If Melayne is not careful, her truth will be revealed.

Great Job!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes too long to get to Dragonholme","review":"This book is alright if you want a light read, but it really isn't that good. The main character is a Mary Sue that all plot conflicts splash off of with no real challenge. Everyone loves her, her Talent is stronger than most, and she manages to overturn a prison/boot camp with little effort. Most of the male characters who aren't trying to kill her seem to be immediately enraptured by the charms of her.The plot itself isn't so bad, its not fabulous, except for the fact that the secrets or location mentioned in the title doesn't show up until the last half or so. Before that its her and her brother living a charmed existence as refugees. And there is no real resolution, the book just ends, the characters go off to...do things and the book just...stops.Its a fairly simple read but really one can probably find something better to spend your time on."},{"rating":"2","title":"I just loved this book.","review":"I had picked this book up in a used bookstore and thought it sounded interesting. I was not disapointed. From beginning to end I was wondering what would happen next. I think Melayne is a great role model for girls. After her parents are killed in a raid she is able to get her brother Sarrow to safety while befriending wolves, and fighting to get the other talents freed from certain death. I would recommend that everyone read this book. You don't have to be a kid. I was 21 when I first read it and I just re-read it at the age of 29. Also for everyone who has read and wished for a sequal I recently found the authors website and on the news page he said that he has had a lot of requests for a sequal and he is now working on one called The Slayers Of Dragonhome. So keep your eye out for it.Also if you enjoyed this book there is a series by Tamora Pierce you should read.Wild Magic (Immortals)Wolf-speaker (Immortals)Emperor Mage (Immortals)The Realms of the Gods (Immortals, Book)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What are you guys smoking?","review":"Okay, this book was amusing the first time I read it. Needless to say, I was seven. Now that I look back on it, is so full of plot holes that it's not even funny. It is out of its time too. I mean, come on, matches? Where would the heroine get matches? It is so obvious that the author did not feel like taking the time to add a decent substitute. And they just go around disrupting everything and getting away with it, with absolutely no consiquences. I must say though, it was an interesting between-book filler."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST BOOK EVER!!","review":"This was the best book Ive ever read in my life. I just thought it was so cool. If you have a chance to get it you should it's awesome!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic book!","review":"This was an exciting book that gave you a lot or your money. But where is the sequel? They have not gone to the Islands yet, Sarrow is still...treacherous, and Melayne hasn't fulfilled her promise to the other Talents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great and thrilling...keeps you turning the pages.","review":"Great book. Makes you keep turning the page. Can't stop reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Alright...","review":"The plot is juvenile, the characters are rather flat (but they have so much /potential/!), and the things that go on are generally a bit unbelievable, but it's an easy read and relatively safe, if certain analretentive parents are worried that little Mary might find out what sex is. The romantic subplot is decent (and Lord Sander is actually quite drool worthy), and Melayne's brother is a spoiled rotten little brat. Dragonhome is slightly-more-than-vaugely reminiscent of the \\"The Immortals\\" quartet, by Tamora Pierce (Immortals is better). All in all, this isn't the best book I've ever read, but not the worst either, and I thank Mr. Peel for starting me out reading the fantasy genre. Fair warning: the end calls for a sequel which (unfortunately) doesn't exist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh my God, this book is AMAZING!","review":"John Peel, wherever you are, you are awesome! This is the best book I have ever read in my entire life! I couldn't put it down, it was impossible! This book is about a girl named Melayne and her brother Sarrow whos parents are slain by raiders. They fled their homes in hopes to reach their aunt way up north. The problem is they posses special talents and soldiers are after them. They run and find the old palace called Dragon home owned by a sad, and some say crazy, Lord Sander. She goes there looking for work and gets more than she bargained for. It's a fantasticle mystery full of love, surprises, fantasy, hatred, and joy. I reccomend this to anyone who can read. This is the best book I have ever read! And as for you, John Peel, YOU MUST WRIGHT A SEQUAL! PPLLEEAASSEE! I BEG YOU!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite fantasy book ever!","review":"Melayne is a teenage girl living in a fantasy kingdom embroiled in a war with another. She and her younger brother, Sarrow, are \\"Talents,\\" which means they have special powers. It also means they are hunted down mercilessly. After her parents are killed at the hands of soldiers, Melayne and Sarrow flee for their lives to the neighboring enemy kingdom, where they pose as citizens. Melayne and Sarrow go to the castle of the young, widowed Lord Sander, where Melayne is givin a job to care for Sander's little boy. But there's at secret at the castle of Dragonhome that puts them all at danger. This book has everything: action, fantasy, suspense, plot twists, and even a romance (between Melayne and Sander). Please let their be a sequal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is the best book ever written","review":"This book is about a girl named Melanya and her brother Sarrow. They are talents, which means the are gifted with a special power. their parents did not want them to get caught by the seekers so they hid them away. When Melanya's parents were killed by raiders they went on an adventure to find their aunt and live with her. Their plans change when the seekers come after them. To hide Melanya and her brother go to a castle called dragonhome. This castle was owned by Lord Sander and his child, Corran. While staying with them, Melayne finds a dark secret that Lord Sander is hiding. Melanya must help him with the secret and protect the secret also. While doing this someone very close to her will betray her. Read this book cause this is the only book I read all of and I think that anyone would love to read a book with romance, adventure, and fantasy. You will have to read the story to find the secret and what happens to Melanya and her friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Beach","review":"I loved Dragonhome, my friend recommended it to me, she has read about 54 times.

I found that it did the plot no justice and that I didnt really get that feeling of living the story. I also found the dialogue rather elementary. I think that the book went through several setting that could have been decribed more. Backrounds and explinations of the characters were rather predictable and cliche. I did like this book, and got interested enough to continue it, despite my judgments, I just found that it could have been written better. I guess that the targeted audience is a bit younger than 14, so it is good for its age group but far too good of a story line to be wasted on a small childrens book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book","review":"This was definitely a good book, although by no means spectacular. From the beginning, Melayne and Sarrow (the main characters) spend all their time hiding from seekers. The seekers find 'talented' youngsters and train them to fight in a senseless war. The book has many underlying messages and the lessons learned about discrimination and prejudice can easily be applied to our own world. I felt, however, that many of the events happened too quickly, and that the book left a great many loose ends. This book is probably best for ages 11-13, although older readers wanting just a simple, yet good story will also appreciate the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you all nuts?","review":"Okay, no offense but seriously, this book could have been witten by a 11 year old! It is full of loose ends and cheesy plot lines. It's predictable and annoying. The main character is headstrong to the point of pigheaded-ness and her brother is both baddly written and so obviously villianous.The reason you all want a sequal is becasue there is no resolution to anything that happenes. These two characters go along couseing trouble and disruping life for everyone around them but never facing the final consiquenses of their actions.This book also portrays the adults of the world in such an evil light. There is no depth to their motivations at all. It's all blind fury jumping to conclusions about worst case seniarios.If you want a GOOD book read Tamora Pierce or Patricia Wreede!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Torn on this one","review":"On one hand I love fiction which pushes the limits, but on the other hand the story was kind of lame. The language flowed well so I never felt bored or irritated while reading it (although as I have said in other reviews, reading is a personal experience in which a reader may connect with a story). The violence was over the top and some of the scenes were hard to read. However, since I never sympathized with the character, even at the end, I never really cared. Maybe this was the intent or maybe not. I would recommend mostly because I love extreme fiction. If the character had been developed just a little more and the story elaborated on in certain parts it would have been a five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"low profile design misleading","review":"If you want to do some rough grinding this sander can handle the job,but if you want a nice flat smoothly sanded panel,\\"forget it\\".This sander is very unstable and I would of given it a lower rating then 1 star by far!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok","review":"I think I like this more than my dog!

Also, the ball (which absorbs water to freeze) was too big for her to fit in her mouth, so she didn't chew on it while teething. I ended up just freezing a wet hand towel folded in half for her to chew while teething. One of our other (larger) dogs then chewed the streamers off this toy, so it's also not very durable.I probably should have looked at the dimensions more closely before I ordered the product but I just assumed that it would be smaller since it was for a puppy. *sigh* Money wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for all puppies","review":"I purchased this toy for my three month old Rott/Lab mix puppy.

I threw the packaging away and followed him (it was less than a minute) and by the time I got to him he had six of the knots chewed off the ends of the strings and I could only find four. This would be ok for supervised play, but definitely should not be advertised as a \\"teether\\" as it will not stand up to a lot of chewing. The two missing knots did turn up the next day as a colorful surprise during our morning walk."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for teething","review":"My Pup loves this toy.

The album just doesn't have a soul to it at all, it's just mass produced garbage. Don't get me wrong, I'm not opposed to mainstream music.

If you want REAL punk, then I highly highly highly recommend: The Ramones, Rancid, Less than Jake, and The Clash.

I went to see Sum 41 and was disappointed with their performance. Good Charlotte though was amazing. They came out and just rocked the crowd. I loved their new material so much that within a week I had gone out and bought this cd. Its just as great as they are live. Now I'm hooked and am huge Good Charlotte fan.They've really grown up a lot w/this albumn compared to the last. All 60 min. of the cd is listenable and I don't skip any songs.

Good Charlotte is incapable of ever creating true musical art because they have no credibility to begin with. Punky beats are not creative, playing the same four barre chords over and over again is so incredibly cheap and easy. Real music is hard to play and much more creative. Someone needs to tell these guys that there is so much more to guitar than moving up and down the fret board. If good charlotte wanted to be taken seriously, they should stop pretending to be so artsy when all they make is pop punk crap.

They arent anything like punk anymore. This is radio-pop,hip hop. They had a huge fanbase and they blew it. I can understand pop-punk changing to metal like blink 182 and sum 41, but hip-hop???

They got this vision that they are so bloody good in singing ndm playing instruments when they so clearly cant. (Ok, maybe the instrument part is a little too exaggerated. They play ok. Guess I have been listening to too much Yngwie Malmsteen).This is punk music in its most naseous, gassy state, in all its vomit-inducing glory.

After hearing \\"I just want to live\\" and \\"predictable\\" I thought it would be a decent album. Boy, I was wrong. The only songs I sort of like (that's not a lot) are their two singles.All the songs sound exactly the same. Or they sound very much like some of their other songs on their previous albums. (which btw, were way better.) This one was on the shelf in about 3 listens. To make matters worse, I was trying to sell this to a friend. That's how bad it is!Whatever, all you rabid good charlotte fans like anything these guys throw at you.Definately Not worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like New Found Glory Said...\\" It's all downhill from here!\\"","review":"This album is a prime example of Good Charlotte's inability to write good music. I mean if you're going to be a pop rock band, atleast write good pop rock. But name a punk band out there who writes a rap song, and is serious about it. This album just does not do it, GC was in a great position with having a large fan base to put out a killer album, and this album sounds rushed and uncreative... If you're going to buy a GC album, buy their first one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The death of Good Charlotte","review":"I have been a fan of Good Charlotte since 2001 when I first heard \\"Little Things\\". I honestly loved their music, till this CD hit my played. In all utter honesty, it was horrible. Joel Madden sounds like a dying cat when singing on \\"The Truth\\" and if anything, this CD is the downfall of a once great band. The only actual GOOD thing about this album was the hidden track \\"Wounded\\" because that's the GC I grew up loving. But now, they just plain suck. So frankily, I think that GC should hang it up for the sake of all man kind."},{"rating":"1","title":"To set the record straight","review":"There was a kids review a few down from me that says for real punk check out fall out boy or rise against.Both this band and those bands are NOT punk. They are punk rock (if that), which is totally different. Now i don't like this band or fall out boy which are abit to \\"my girlfriend broke up with me\\", but i think rise agaisnt a breathe of fresh air in this shallow punk rock world. Anyway, punk is dead i hate to admit but it is. Punk is the misfits, sex pistols, dead kennedys and so on. This is NOT punk, this is poor punk rock.Anyway this cd is fairly bad, it has it's high points but their more like medium points. This could very well be the band that caused the flood of crappy imatation punk rock bands. I don't like good charlotte or the people that call them punk, learn your music history before you start labelling music and yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"*Puts in CD* What the?!","review":"I will tell you right now, when I first listened to The Young And The Hopeless, I fell in love w/ it! But The Chronicles Of Life & Death sounds like something from The Backstreet Boys or Nsync! EWWW! I dont know what happened to this great band, but they definetly have changed there genre from rock to pop! I will admit, a few of the songs are good, but for the most part, its just way too pop for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"PUNK IN A DIFFERENT DEGREE","review":"If you think that Good Charlotte is not Punk you don't know your music. They are punk all the way, don't listen to other people. Why do people always say Good Charlotte is no good, and that they can sing? Why? They can sing, and they make great music. Ask Mr. Billboard, and yes I am talking about the billboards chart. This album peaked in 3rd. So they are good.Predictable and I Just Wanna Live opened this album up to the public. I just don't get why Chronicals Of Life and Death hasn't been played on the radio, because that song is the best on the album, come one and follow me as I lead you to one great album.You should try your best to get this album into your hands. This band should keep doing what they are doing, cause if they don't it will not help them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, it's","review":"OK, I never really like GC (I though they were sexist).My best friend's sister was a a big fan of these guys. I mean they had there moments, but this really tops the cake. I only bought it because of \\"Predictable\\".I thought \\"Hey its that sexist band...\\" but hell I thought I would give them a chance, so I wasted my money on this horrible freakin CD. When I heard the song \\"I just want to live\\", I took a knife to it and started to hack it into pieces then burned holes in it... All they say basicially is, \\"OMG PLZ PRAY FOR M3(...)\\". Along with Slipknot and ICP, this band should have no fans by now...or none really to begin with."},{"rating":"1","title":"0 Stars","review":"This is absolutely the worst Good Charlotte album yet. Dont waste your money. I have been a fan since before they hit mtv. Their first album self titled \\"Good Charlotte\\", was by far the best album they made. The last one was bad but this just tops the charts. The only album i recommend to by is their first album before they got big, its always any artists best album. I can listen to that cd all day long the whole cd through there arent many albums nowadays that u can do that buy the first one u wont be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"stick a fork in them - they are DONE","review":"I will spare everyone the song-by-song disection of this album - it is terrible from front to finish.

Predictable is the only song I like on here. And GC isn't punk... but don't hold it against them. They're mislabled, that's all.

Take GC for what it is: a decent pop band."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Would've Given IT a BIG FAT ZERO","review":"I must admit, that I USED to be a good charlotte fan, back in the day.

It's a waste of your precious money."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can I stop my ears from hemorrhaging blood?!?!?!?!","review":"If I could give this embarrassment of a cd a negative rating, believe you me, I would. Alas, the worst I can do is give a one star.. Ah, the injustices of Amazon.com.Goodness gracious, this is one seriously GOD-AWFUL album. Do not waste your money or your time on this 'music' by one of the most talentless, preposterous, and pretentious bands of all time.Is Good Charlotte Punk? Are they 'Bubblegum-Punk'? Are they 'Faux-Punk'? Honestly, who the hell cares? All you need to know if you are un-familiar with their music is that they suck!

Seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Charlotte","review":"I honestly don't really like Good Charlotte that much. Yeah, I suppose this studio recording isn't done too bad, but they aren't very popular anymore and you can sooo tell once you've read atleast the first page of reviews for this album (which are mostly made up of 1-star ratings) that they aren't very popular anymore. Also, when they sing live, they always shout at the microphone, and I really don't call that singing. If you're a fan of their older music (like I am a ex/former-fan - but now I've really gone off them), then I wouldn't recommend it. Before, they use to have a few hits on both sides of the atlantic (Boys & Girls, Life Styles Of The Rich & Famous etc...), but the last of their good work they put out was Predictable. Oh, did I mention I'm only 13 - I'm not another adult who just hates the whole idea of trying to be punk/rock.Go ahead and vote \\"Not helpful\\". I don't really care, as long as I get my point across."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst music i've ever heard.","review":"dont tell me everyone has there own tastes. Because i heard nothing talented on this album and the only reason you are listening to it is cuz it is on MTV and the radio and half of you listen to it you think your punk and punk is trendy, the other halfs musical taste is not mature enough to realize that there is no talent on this cd. I know punk is not about being talented, but if there is not instrumental talent there is song writing talent and a cause. these guys wine about girls and they are in it for the money. Pop is easy to write, so these guys figure out how to play power chords and they become millionairs. See, thats how the pop industry works. And the Good Charlotte fans are just being sucked into this scam so a bunch of losers can make some cash. Now im not going to pass jugement on you as a person, im just saying that you should wake up and relize what your listening too and then buy a minor threat album."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite CDs, whether its punk or not","review":"By the way, I'm not a kid. This was just easier (-.')This is a great CD from a great band!! Each song has so much meaning, and it's all about real things. Who cares about the stupid labels people put on music? It doesn't have to be punk to be good. It just has to be good on its own. I loved this CD because all the songs sound so cool, and it's easy to relate to all the songs, and the words make you think. Good Charlotte is a great band made up of a lot of very cool people who are aware of what's going on in the world. BUY THIS CD NOW!

For all you \\"hardcore\\" punks out there who are saying, \\"This is crap, don't buy it, listen to metallica, listen to nirvana,\\" why are you even reviewing here? This genre of music isn't for you. Good Charlotte is pop-punk. Why can't you understand that? Only an idiot would think that this band is hardcore punk. Save your \\"Sex Pistols are so much better than this crap\\" for your online anti-GC forums or whatknot.This is a great CD. Different from their first and second albums, but still enjoyable. I agree that The Truth is one of the worst songs I have ever heard, and that's why this album is missing that last star, but otherwise it's amazing. I enjoy their lyrics much more than their self-titled album and The Young and the Hopeless-- they are deeper and more mature.If you are a fan of pop-punk music or just plain pop-rock, don't hesitate to buy this CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ITS TIME WE KILL GOOD CHARLOTTE","review":"ok i hate all these band members and i wish them an early painful death. i think we should tie them down and make them listen to their torturous s**t all day. they have nothing on the Dead Kennedys or The Germs.

Congrats guys you earned everyone 10 fold. Anyways, THIS IS NOT PUNK, THIS IS POP THROUGH AND THROUGH, you want punk get Dead Kennedy's, Dropkick Murphy's, Flogging Molly, Oi Polloi, Ramones, to name a few, download some of that then read how foolish you were to call these tools punk. HA!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Attempt to meaning","review":"I was just going to write another on of my moronic reviews, but i couldn't stand anything about the album.I hate good charlotte, they sound EXACTLY like every other prep-rock band (fall out boy, my chemical romance, simple plan ect.) I could tell simply by comparing the name of the album to the \\"song\\" names that this had nothing to do with life or death, and considering their preppy reputation that there would be no hidden meanings withing the songs. After i listened to a couple of these so called \\"songs\\" i turned it off, and quickly threw it out of the window.My point being, with bands such as this, don't expect anything hidden within the title, or the music. It will just be a boring listen the entire way through. If you were looking for an album that DOES have meaning, and is fun to listen too. I suggest eating your own exrement."},{"rating":"1","title":"This young fart thinks they suck!","review":"And not just any kind of suck.

Punk is bands like The Sex Pistols and The Ramones. That is punk. Either way, Punk sucks. Listen to Metal, it has skill on instruments, talented vocals, and oh my god! Behold! THOUGHT PROVOKING SONGS!This is crap. Just along with the long line of bands that MTV has crapped out, to go along with Avril Lavinge, Simple Plan, Greenday and all the other crap.

People are complaining how this cd isn't good, because it's so different. The songs show how much they have matured. And for the person that said they digitally made the voice high pitched in \\"I Just Wanna Live\\"-- NOT TRUE. I was watching making the video on it, and Paul was saying how they were going to shoot the video (Benji was with him), and then all of a sudden, Benji sings \\"I Just Wanna Live.\\" So that proves wrong what you said.

And now, on 'The Chronicles of Life and Death', they have gone rap and sold out even more on the number one most overplayed song on the radio in 2004, \\"I Just Wanna Live.\\" Please, Good Charlotte...play some REAL punk, or just shoot and kill yourselves dead.

Any one who hates good charlotte because of the last 2 albums, i would say give the first one a go, if u still don't like it fair enough but i really would give it a go.If you are a fan of predictable then you will like this album but for me the only good song on it is \\"falling away\\" and that is nowhere near the standard of songs from the first album.Even the young and hopeless is better then this album, at least they were still vaguely similar to the first album.What really convinced me was seeing predictable played on music channels, this is not the good charlotte we know and love!!!hope i have helped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute rip offs","review":"They blatantly ripped off MUSE and fall flat on their face.

Its not heavier it even more poppy and the maddens brothers are even more angrier after they sold 3.3 million records after that suicide of the young adn the hopeless. As i recall they seemed more happier when they relased thrte first piece of garbage before the young.... Well i guess they hate fame and need more of a gimick for poeple ot buy into them now. Please for the sake of god people stop iseninto to Charlotte is not punk. Trapt is not metal. Simple plan is not pop punk there pop.

First off, I'm not some kind of hard core punk who thinks every band is some kind of sell out or poser. Along with that I'm not a little fan girl who falls in love with a band just because they're are \\"so friggin hott!\\" Personally I don't like Good Charlotte. I can't really stand them. Although, the band does have a few catchy songs overall. Some parts are akward for me, listening to the talking/screaming part of \\"Predictable\\". I must say that was pretty gay. I listened to my friend's copy and tracks 11 was alright. The Chronicles of Life & Death is supposed to be their 'growing up' album but I don't think I buy it just yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falling Short","review":"I thought this cd would further expound on the Young and the Hopeless which I thought was an excellent cd.

The music they write almost compelled me to take a drill and stick it in my ear. Wow. Why do they dress like they are hardcore, when obviously they are a bunch of choir boys. Honestly, poeple should listen to musically talented bands like Dream Theater. These guys can't play their instruments wthout their mother's help. *Sigh, to see bands like this degrade our music. Why do Americans have such bad taste in music. So in conclusion I would not recommend this band due to the obvious fact that they are repetitive, whiny choir boys, and they should be banished."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's so Predictable.","review":"This is a very weak effort, it has a RAP SONG, pure rap, I mean you'd think they couldnt sell out anymore but I guess they did. The best song is \\"Predictable,\\" and thats sad. the rest of the songs are much less catchy, the song \\"Wounded\\" is a decent slow song tho, but besides that.. and whats up with that Harry Potter intro!?! it goes about 2:42 minutes to long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some people don't know real music","review":"This cd is great. I don't know why people say they don't like it, probably because they wouldn't know good music if it slapped them across the face. The boys of GC were creative and wanted to grow with their music. Just because they were once a \\"rock\\" or \\"punk\\" or even a \\"pop\\" band doesn't mean they can put some rap or hip hop into their sound and experiment with new things. Songs like S.O.S. and Secrets are both amazing songs and it's sad that people won't see that because they expect GC to always be the same. Anyway, if you don't judge GC too harshly and you like experimenting with listening to all types of music, pick up this cd, I can guarentee I didn't regret it and neither will you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT....THE....HELL MAN","review":"Okay, this is what I mean when I tell people I hate commercial, posey, fake ass pop/punk bands. They were alright back in the day...but these guys are just lame. Everthing about them is lame from their lame image, to their lame songs, to their lame videos. Even their tattoos are lame! They are just LAME! They suck! Very badly. If you wanna hear good pure punk go buy Alkaline Trio! Good Charlotte is horrible. They just need to hang up the mics and unplug the guitars and go hang outside of a bar singing their songs with a cup for donations.

I know most of you mall punks who are over weight 8th graders who wear star wrists bands are scared of singers who have actually hit puberty, so Im not going to bother recommending another band or album because having an intelligent conversation with a Good Charlotte fan is damn near impossible.

I don't have a sculpting stick but I find ways around that obstacle. I don't feel the burn from this workout's floor segments unless I use heavier weights than they do, but then that's what Firm workouts are designed to do. Aside from that, the moves are mostly easy to follow once you catch on, and there is one samba track I enjoy. However, I wouldn't recommend this video for a complete beginner.

I never use the sculpting stick, I always hold two 5 or 10lb dumbbells depending on which routine it is. Compared to all the other BSS#2 DVDs I'd say this one is the toughest. The step work is hard and it did take me a while to get it all down. But even now that I know the moves by heart I'm still sweating like crazy and feel like my lungs are going to burst out of my chest when I'm done with it.

Until now, it has been pretty useful, though the dust collection bag is poorly designed.Yesterday in the middle of a job the sanding disc kept flying off. The rubber sanding pad on the base provides the hooks for the hook-and-loop system, and that pad somehow lost its hookiness. No new pad will stick to it.I don't know what caused this: I was using a light touch, and my sanding disc storage organizer uses pegs to ensure the disc's holes line up with those in the pad. Whatever the cause, I now have to order a replacement pad which is nearly one-third the cost of a new sander and may take a week or more for delivery. I'm not sure whether I'd be throwing good money after bad -- I might be better off buying a brand new sander by a different manufacturer.You might, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"disc does not stick.

Dan Gutman does a great job of building the suspense to the climactic moment when the 11 year old narrator takes the million dollar shot during halftime of the NBA finals. (My son was amazed that Mr. Gutman was able to write two whole chapters -- albeit short ones -- focusing on the period of time while the ball was in the air. And we eagerly devoured them. I took the opportunity to point out that this was GOOD WRITING). Along the way Mr. Gutman throws in a few lessons about friendship, loyalty, and the value of hard work.

When he hears that there was a shot for a million dollars he wrote a poem and sent it in. When he got a letter in the mail he was amased he had won the contest. I think the book was amasing.

Even if there isn't a lot of snow and you're trying to clear a path in a small driveway or on the side walk, if the snow is too heavy, the Snow Joe barely budges or it doesn't dig deep. You have to go over the snow with several passes to even see the ground and I'm talking about only a few inches of snow. I had to eventually put this product aside and start using my shovel again. I don't like having to reshovel what this product is supposed to be plowing through.

Once the snow settles and hardens a little, this device gets overwhelmed.If you have a serious back condition, I guess this might make sense, since you don't have to do the shoveling motion.

I used to have to stomp a trail around the yard so my old dogs could get around when the snow was deep. One year, the drifts got pretty high and it was almost impossible to stomp down. The Snow Joe is light enough to lift up on the drifts and throw the snow in layers. It's probably not the safest thing to do, but I made sure the dogs were inside and I worked slowly. I was amazed at how I was able to clear a trail through all that snow and I'm a senior citizen. I could never have done it with a shovel.I've seen some complaints about broken blades, but after two years of use, I've had no trouble.

The Snow Joe Plus isn't a miracle machine, but if you take your time, and control it so you don't take more than a 4\\" deep bite at a time, it can move some serious snow. The only downside is it only throws it straight ahead, so be careful if you're working towards your house, or any windows. Your arms and shoulders will also have to get used to bearing its weight, which is considerably less than a shovel full of wet snow.All in all, its fun to operate, helps to save your back, and performs exactly as advertised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light and Efficient","review":"I bought the SnowJoe at the end of last season so I could put my herky gas-powered blower into storage early. When the first snow came this season, I took the SnowJoe out and went to work on two inches of fresh snow on my driveway. The SnowJoe's performance astonished me. It made short work of my driveway and the sidewalk in front of my house, and it did the job again the next day on four more inches of snow. My only criticisms are (1) it only throws straight ahead, so it builds a bow wave that can get in the way of progress, and (2) its effectiveness is strongly dependent on the handle angle during operation. Considering the SnowJoe's light weight and simplicity, those things seem pretty minor to me.

The flavors are great. I would have given five stars, but I think one thing is missing.

This is a beautiful story of a town, it's people, the war and how it effects those around it........and so much more. Yes, as some have mentioned it is riddled with \\"salty\\" launguage but that did not bother me, in fact it kind of made me laugh at times. I thought the language authentic to the story.

I will buy other books by this author. Couldn't stop reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"I loved this book! I actually listened to the audio book version on my evening walks and more than a few times found myself laughing out loud or drying my tears. The book will definitely make you laugh, cry and smile. The story line is wonderful and the characters are likable, you can't help but love Earwig. Not often do you come across books that truly have it all. I read Kring's \\"Thank You For All Things\\" as well and while I liked it, this book just blew me away. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"an unexpectedly astute narrator","review":"My last review teetered around a 3.5 and I couldn't bring myself to round up. In this case, I'm more than happy to grant four stars (I'm stingy about five...).The protagonist of Carry Me Home is a young man who goes by the nickname Earwig and has an unidentified mental disability. He can't make change or understand some basic facts but he has a clear view of people and a sharp sense of what makes someone noble. The novel is largely set during WWII and explores a small town during the war and in its aftermath, looking at both those on the homefront and those (like Earwig's brother) who fought overseas.There isn't much groundbreaking in the plot but the author shows her keen grasp of human nature through Earwig's thoughts and actions. I read it in a day, enjoying the simple but clear voice of the prose. The novel has its sadness but also a great deal of beauty and good. Kring reminds us that astute and wise observers often come in unexpected packages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, heart warming story!","review":"This book was one of my all time favorites which I will always remember - difficult to put it down. I found myself laughing, then tearing up at the same time. Earl \\"Earwig\\" is such a perfect character in this book and Sandra Kring is a brilliant writer. This is one of those novels which touches so many subjects and events during the 40's - 50's, especially during the war and the families who suffered also. Well worth the read!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST! I wish the book would never end!","review":"One of the BEST! The type of book I wish would never end.

Kring depicts a simple picture of life in a small town with a true understand what these people had to contend with during the war.

I've had them on two electric guitars - a 6-string for a few years, and recently equipped a 12-string with them.The locking feature makes string changes occur in minutes. The auto trim feature snips excess string cleanly and effortlessly. The 18:1 ratio makes accurate tuning quite easy. They're very solid-feeling.

No matter how long I spent adjusting it, I couldn't get the rear of the fence to lock solid, or to lock in the same place every time. VERY frustrating when you're trying to make pieces of plywood with square corners.This is not the same caliber tool as Makita's hand tools.It may work OK for carpenters, but compared to woodworking, they don't need any kind of precision. For that, a good contractor saw like a Jet would be good. But do spend the money for the upgraded fence. The stock fences on those are garbage too. If you really need a lightweight, compact saw, look at the DeWalt and the Bosch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makita fan","review":"Great saw.

We use Rousseau stands, out feed tables and extensions.It may not have shop type accuracy, but it certainly beats all the other portables for toughness and portability.The only problem we have is they STOPPED making them. Doesn't make sense to us.So if any one would like to sell one please let us know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Table saw flaw","review":"Don't buy this saw. There appears to be a manufacturing defect in the rack plate which allows adjustment of the beveled angle on the saw. Makita needs to rethink their design and use steel instead of plastic for this part. Twice now I have purchased the saw and had to return it because several teeth were missing on this plate making bevel adjustments impossible. This can create a real problem in delays for the professional contractor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed bevel system","review":"The unit I received within 10 uses developed a bad bevel adjustment system, which made it impossible to do fine adjustments of the bevel.

After a couple of months of light use, however, the locking mechanism for the bevel adjustment had stripped, allowing the bevel angle to shift while cutting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now close to 5 with the addition of the Rousseau 2600","review":"The factory fence sucked bad. I added the Rousseau 2600 fence system and it now a different saw, plenty of power, now very accurate. I use the portable setup in the bed of truck, sitting the saw on the tailgate at least 3 times a week ripping material for jobs. Bought this saw for $151 atHD so even happier at that price. Rousseau was $101 with all the Amazon deals available at the time, $30 off, Gold Box, and A9. Believe it or not I still like my old 2708 better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful Saw But......","review":"I would purchase this saw again because its great! But be careful. I took the blade guard off and ended up with a scrap 2X4 in the eye. Boy did that hurt! I put the guard back on just for safety reasons but it blocks the view of where your fingers are. Within a couple of days, I cut all the fingers off of my left hand. Now because of my nubs, I cant woodwork at all. I probably should have bought a Porter cable instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-standard Miter Slot","review":"Tenon jig, forget it. Featherboard, nope. Accurate miter gage, negative. Any accesories to make this saw do more than ripping, out of the question. Documentation of the non-standard miter slot, non-existent. Don't buy this saw unless you are looking for a plain old plywood cutter. It does that pretty good though.-------------------An update - Still using this saw, still cursing the fence and MITER SLOT. Recently I've found the arbor to be way short for dadoing. Maximum dado width is 3/8\\". List price of $550? Are they joking? You can buy a Grizzly cabinet saw for a little more than that. Seriously, all you can do with this saw is basic ripping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makita needs to update this product","review":"This saw used to be the end-all in portable table saws. It's still as tough as they come, but Makita has done little to improve it's features in the twenty years I've been working. It is lightweight, but the fence and sliding angle guide are highly inaccurate. If you buy this saw, I recommend purchasing the Rousseau table with it to ensure an accurate fence, outfeed and extension tables. Unfortunately, the cost of both table and saw exceed that of buying a truly good job-site table saw such as the Bosch, DeWalt or Porter Cable. I'm really surprised, too, because Makita offers (in my opinion) the best 10\\" sliding compound miter saw on the market. If all you're doing is framing, buy the Makita."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly inaccurate waste of money","review":"I have been using this saw for 2 years as an on site stair builder after my employer purchased this saw against my, and my coworkers, recomendations. This saw is cheaper than the DeWalt and the Bosch, and it shows. The miter gauge was used once and found to be useless. The fence is a joke, getting it square to the blade requires a measurement from both ends of the blade, keeping it square requires no pressure against the fence. For cuts that require accuracy, more often than not, I resort to clamping a guide board to the table to ensure that it will slide, or flex, halfway through the cut. If you are looking for quality and accuracy spend the extra dough and buy a DeWalt or Bosch, the time and aggravation saved is well worth the money spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad arbor design","review":"Ive used the old 8 1/2 makita for years, and now owned the 10\\" (and the Bosch) for a few years now. I loved the portability (best part) and the fence is god-awful unless you get the rousseau table. It would be the ideal set-up, but the arbor stinks on this one--with a 100 dollar new blade, it still scores up the cut--meaning I have to joint or sand every finished piece. You can see the wobble as you turn it on. I've heard the same complaint from other contractors, and it has been mentioned on this board. MAKITA WAKE UP! I would never buy this saw again if this weren't fixed--if it were, the saw would tear off the roof!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY IT!!!!!","review":"This is by far the worst Makita product I've ever purchased! I unfortunately didn't return it within the 30 day period. Now, I'm stuck with it. The fence is a joke. Getting the fence to clamp straight takes longer than cutting the piece by hand. The mitre guide is a joke. If you can live with +- 3 degrees you are ok. The guide fits very loosely in the table groove so its impossible to get an accurate cut. It's the worst $300 I've ever spent on a tool. You would be hard pressed to find a lower quality table saw. The only positive is that it is light and will be easy to throw in the dumpster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Canadian English is not American English.","review":"Spellings of words like colour, centre, travelled as color, center, and traveled, are referred to as \\"North American\\" in origin implying that US and Canadian English are the same.

This is an extremley lazy and ignorant compilation of the English language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Too Good","review":"I needed a replacment for my Black & Decker DYI cheapy which died while cutting brick. Got the Makita. Not good. It worked well for several hours. The thin base plate kept slipping under my guide, but the alignment guide alowed me to maitain a relatively straight cut. After a couple days, however, the blade no longer tracked with the alighnment mark. I called a Makita Factory Service Center (closest one was 4 hours away)and asked if there was any adjustment for tracking. They said no, but that they could fix it. I kept going for a few more days, then gave up. After 9 days use I returned it and bought a Porter-Cable. I realy liked the balance and power of the Makita. The base plate is too thin and loads up easily. When loaded up it is difficult to maintain a smooth cut. Bottom line: Not Good, but better than a Black & Decker cheapy though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid!","review":"Wish I had looked into this CD more before buying it.

Filled with cat's,dog's horses cow's and chickens the whole book is a delight. Told from a realistic perspective it deals with life and death, the whole circle of life. The pictures as wonderfull at capturing the funny personaltites of the different animals. I cannot reccomend this book highly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best. Book. Ever.","review":"I first encountered this book as a young nursery school teacher in the early eighties. It became one of my favorites right away, and has remained so. I continue to ensure that classrooms have a copy, and I give it to children (and sometimes adults) as gifts.It's so *real*, so rich. Every animal has a little bit of personality, the human relationships with them are so real. Some bits will always stick in my brain -- Max with his snake, Dinah moving rocks, dog-weighing, horses in the pond, sheep with flowers in their wool.The illustrations are very simple, and perfectly evocative.Every person who likes animals even a tiny bit should own this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fondest Childhood Memories-Mine and Passed Down","review":"This is the most memorable book of my childhood and adult life. I read it countless times as a child, and kept it safe until I was able to share this wonderful creation with my niece, Phylicia, and nephew, Mark. As a child, living in the country, books were all I had, and this one kept me content for hours. In turn, Fee and Mark grew to love it as it covered every animal they had been exposed to in their short lives. It gave them insight into the animal's personalities, how to treat them, how to care for them. They got to imagine having these types of pets of their own, and it made for many creative days for the three of us, reading and learning together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure delight","review":"I have had this book for more than 20 years and it still makes me smile the way it did when I was 4."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not appropriate for preschoolers","review":"This book is terrible for young children.

I had my infant son sitting on my lap and we were both delighted by the different animals from the farm. I remember going from laughing to holding back tears. It is so true. Our own animal friends have the same affect...from laughter to tears.Besides being very entertaining, I find a bit of widsom there that is priceless for dealing with the loss of a pet. It has become a tradition over the years to read from the book at our \\"pet funerals\\" and I took the book down from the shelf just for myself after the recent loss of a 16 year old cat.Like many others here, we've worn out our original copy. Mom made sure each grandchild had a copy in their homes and I've done the same with my own grandchildren. We loved it so much, we've had many pets named after the characters in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What an awful book!","review":"Overall, this book reads like a rambling essay written by a 4th grader.

Our girls (ages 3 and 7) adore this book - and so do we.The book tells about the different animals on the farm. Over several pages, for example, Mrs. Provensen tell about the four cats who live at Maple Hill farm: Gooseberry, who is a good mother; Eggnog, who is beautiful but not interresting; Willow, who is old; and Max, who is big, likes cottage cheese, but is not very clever with his claws. In a series of drawings, we see what the cats do around the farm. The girls love it - they laugh and giggle and listen intently.The dogs, horses, sheep, and chickens all get similar treatment. We give this book to friends, as it is off the mainstream 'radar' of good books: we are sure they won't have it, and we are sure their kids will love it as our do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely not for small children!","review":"My children are now grown and I have grandchildren. I would not read this book to my children and I will never read this book to my grandchildren. If you love animals you won't read it to any child. Yes the illustrations are nice but the idea that any animal is useless and gotten rid of because of some actions is just not right. What message are you sending a child? Are you saying if you do something foolish then we might get rid of you? We need to teach children good values, that they are loved and that we will love and train them just like we love and train our animals. There are so many good books out there - this just isn't one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bizet: Symphony in C major; Jeux d'enfants; Sc��nes Boh��miennes","review":"Bizet: Symphony in C major; Jeux d'enfants; Sc��nes Boh��miennes is 1994 Naxos recording. Donald Johanos leads the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra. Keith Anderson has written the music notes. Compared to either that of Beethoven's or Mozarts symphonies this one feels a little light in quality. Still good enough for a 4 out of 5.

However, I ordered and returned 3 separate DVDs before I finally accepted the fact that the publisher obviously never QC'ed their product. Such a shame - the actors deserve better. Buyer Beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie, horrible discs","review":"I've seen this movie before and it's definitely hilarious and worth purchasing, unfortunately there seems to be something wrong with the company producing these discs. I ordered one and when it came the disc didn't work, I tried it on a few different dvd players and it never worked, so I ordered a replacement, and this one again doesn't work. I'm going to return it and I'll just end up buying a digital copy instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't work","review":"Awesome movie but it does not work. Tried to play it in the PS3 and it started to play a sound but no picture. It quit after that. I made the mistake of not looking at the reviews before i bought this crap on here. Why is this still being sold on here when all of the copies are clearly defective?!! Better off finding someone who had it rented it from redbox since the discs they had worked. I have looked everywhere for this and finally found it...and it doesn't work. ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD doesn't play (tried 2 different players)","review":"This DVD didn't play in any player!

Rather than trying to be a fresh 'Asian' voice, the LeYung Ryan seemed to be using an Asian-american protagonist to deal with universal themes: The difficulties of being pulled in two cultural directions, the wounds of childhood, the awkward role reversal that takes place when a child is called on to care for a parent, the need to take a hard look at the past to gain freedom from its baggage. These themes and her treatment of them is neither cloying nor coy.This author shows a lot of promise and I'm looking forward to her next novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved This Book","review":"Ruby Lin's dilemma, though specific to the individual mother-daughter issues she faces of how to support and love her mother who is plagued with mental illness, is universal to all mothers and daughters. How does one break away without breaking the love between them?I recommend this book to everyone and especially to women who could use a good role model in finding their own personal power to stand up to men who exploit them, abuse them, cast blame or guilt or withhold their love.Ruby Lin, in her quest to become an American Girl, learns powerful advice and strategies from the black and white American movies she watches as a child. When she steps into her own power goosebumps race.The moments of love and surrender, and pain and abuse cause laughter and tears.Above all this book has great heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"LeYung Ryan Writes A Winner","review":"Love Made of Heart is a book made of wisdom.

As other have stated, these writings offer little original insight to knowledgeable students of tennis history. This book could've been a gem; it isn't. Personally, I recommend Peter Bodo's \\"Courts of Babylon\\" - evidently the writer of \\"The Rivals\\" liked it very much too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New","review":"Unless you didn't follow tennis at all in the 70's and 80's there's nothing in this book that will really tell you what you didn't already know. The author admits that she doesn't know much about tennis - and it shows. Even though its completely appropriate to focus on the subject of her book, the author completely dismisses the rest of the womens tennis tour. Some of the very people like Tracy Austin and Hana Mandlikova who were kind enough to give her an interview are then diminished by the author. A poor book from an author that should stick to what she knows."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much more than just a sports book","review":"I fear I will be reiterating what many other reviewers have already said, but wanted to throw my 5 stars into the count. What a great book. I grew up watching many of the matches between Evert and Navratilova discussed in this book and the author does an amazing job recounting them. The back story is worked seamlessly into the book, giving you insight into what was really going on in the matches.I found the history fascinating. Much of the story takes place before Title IX, before gay rights, before women's rights. Makes you realize what pioneers these women were and how much they helped to change the world for the rest of us.If you have even only a casual interest in tennis, I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sports writing - at its BEST!","review":"I watched many of these matches in the 70's and 80's - so it was a thrill to get a behind the scenes look at the rivalry and friendship of Chris & Martina. And who knew? I never remember Bud Collins discussing their friendship. And what a friendship it was (and is.)Howard does a outstanding job recreating the tension of the matches - before, during and after the matches. The last French Open will have you on the edge of your seat.Besides Chris and Martina - Howard gives us great insight into the times - before Title IX, and Billie Jean Kings struggle (perhaps at the expense of her own career) to level the playing field for all women to come.It's about as good as sports writing gets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read for tennis fans","review":"I loved this book because it reminded me of when I used to actually watch tennis and especially women's tennis. I was in love with Chris Evert and loved the detail that is put into telling her story. I was also surprised at how much I enjoyed the information I learned about Martina. A great read for anyone that grew up watching these two great athletes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best sports book I've ever read","review":"I thought I knew so much about Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova until I read Johnette Howard's extraordinary book. From start to finish, I couldn't put it down. The narrative is so compelling. It's not so much a biography as a wonderful story that unfolds page after page. The book is full of anecdotes that stay with you, and Howard draws detailed, insightful, often poignant portraits of Martina and Chris that go far beyond anything I've ever read about them before.Most importantly, to me, Howard excelled at putting Chrissie and Martina's rivalry in human terms. And she provides the sort of historical context that makes this not just a sports book, but a book that reads like a short cultural history of the time that Martina and Chris came along. The chapter about Martina's defection is especially amazing.I'd strongly recommend this book to anyone who loves a good story. You don't have to love tennis or even sports."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love that 1970's Soul","review":"The Main Ingredient were one of the groups that helped define Soul Music of the 1970's. Everybody Plays The Fool, Rolling Down a Mountain Side, Happiness Around The Bend, represented the uptempo dance music that later influenced disco. Spinning Around and Just Don't want to be lonely are classic ballads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bill does it again","review":"I think Bill Phillips gives solid health/fitness advice, but the real key to his commercial success is his ability at selling \\"transformation.\\" He does it again in this VHS, although you can get all three of his VHS tapes converted to DVD now, so check that out.This volume 2 of success stories is not as impressive as Body of Work or volume 1, but it does include one contestant who goes from looking like a washed-up high school gym teacher to a male model. Almost too hard to believe that happened in 3 months!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dire","review":"This book is absolutely dire. Bennett, in a desperate attempt to produce literature on par with the French authors he was so inspired by, wrote this lamentably bad novel. He is often compared to Dickens, who he frankly has no right to be compared to. Dickens is totally out of the league of this author. This book is uninteresting with awkwardly drawn characters. It was a challenge to be bothered to read until the end. It is for a very good reason that Woolf called him a \\"little grocer\\" and observed \\"I have formed my own opinion of what Mr. Bennett is about - he is trying to make us imagine for him; he is trying to hynotize us into the belief that, because he has made a house, there must be a person living there.\\" Exactly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chess Openings Made Easy","review":"This is an easy to read book that attempts to give the player with the Black pieces an opening against just about everything. I think it just about does the task with a look at the Chigorin against 1 d4 and the Centre Counter against 1 e4. They all have a modern twist in an effort to make it easier to absorb. There is plenty to get excited about when it comes to beating mad openings such as 1 g4 and the more sane 1 b3 amongst others. I would guess it is aimed at players below 2200 but with my rating of 1930 I think it is a good book to lean openings quickly and easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Close but not quite","review":"In their earlier days Collectables did a lot of lame releases off of poor vinyl. Nice try here, but the quality of restoration is not the best on some tracks. I'd certainly opt for one of the newer packages of this artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really a calorie burner just a \\"get moving\\" dvd","review":"This dvd was a pretty sorry one. I don't exactly care for the Firm videos but I thought this one would be different for some reason.If you like the other Firm dvds then you'll probably like this one. It's just a big bore for me. The trainers are pretty boring & if you don't have good rhythm you won't be able to keep up. I couldn't get my heart rate up high enough with this one. Neither workout was really a cardio BURN."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth buying","review":"This is a great workout. I especially like the 1st 20 minute session with Emily. It's fun with the countdown bursts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners but does the job","review":"My co-worker and I had a hard time keeping up with this. It's definitely not for beginners, but if you are able to keep up it's a good 20 minute work out. Even though my co-worker and I couldn't keep up, it had has sweating within the 1st 10 minutes! I would suggest warming up before starting it because the instructor goes immediately into the workout w/out warming up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you Sweat","review":"I like this workout because it's non-stop action, gets your heart rate up and keeps it there. I use both 20-minute workouts together, so the only downside is you have to warm up and cool down twice unless you want to do a lot of fast forwarding. But the moves are a little different from other Firm videos, which is refreshing because they're usually very similar and it gets boring. The only part I don't like is the kneeling part in Rebecca's segment, because I have problems with my knees (she has you kneeling and getting up repeatedly) and so I do something else during that part. But overall I like it a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"What U R looking for, though you may not know it!","review":"I'm relatively new to NWW's music, but I've recently been snapping up everything I can get my hands on! No two albums are the same, but this is the entry point, one of the best. There is incredible variety within this album, with ambient segments alternating with more manic stretches, like The Faust Tapes, only both more cohesive and more diverse. Keyboard drones, pipe organ blasts, spaced out electronics, honky-tonk piano, meditative reeds, generator rumble, chirping birds, banjos, jags of noise, phased out martial beats, dubbed out kazoos, bowed pianos, rattling tin cans, guitar skronk,tape loop insanity....it's all here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Corey Feldman","review":"This Movie is typical of bad strait to video horror flicks. A college student, Andy, transfers to a new school, the \\"cool\\" kids don't like him, his girlfriend doesn't seem to either, and the result is that he falls in with the wrong crowd. And boy is it the wrong crowd. A bunch of bad actors playing a voodoo cult posing as a fraternity. Eventually Andy catches on that there is something unusual with this group of guys, but not before they make him do a seemingly endless string of bizarre antics.The interesting, or perhaps the intriguing, event of this film is not any one scene in the movie, but the star, Corey Feldman. Feldman, at least to me, is kind of a cult icon. He had roles in some of the great coming of age/teen idol films of the 80's. As far as I can tell this was the last film he was in. Which I think is just too bad. I would love to see Corey get back in the movies, and back in roles where he can shine. I guess it probably won't happen, but hey, he is above this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Truly Excellent Read!","review":"This is one of the best books I've read in a long time. It kept me on the edge of my seat and I couldn't put it down. Just like with Stieg Larsson's books, the publishers are making a huge mistake by not bringing Jeff Edwards to a wider audience. This book is a hit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good sea story","review":"A pretty good, if extremely unlikely story. There is lots of action.Some good insights into life aboard a destroyer. The political aspect is a bit unrealistic. Good mind candy for leisure reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"My review","review":"Nic. Good technical thriller it made me feel like i was in the navy. Plenty of action a real page turner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very tedious","review":"The plot is implausible, the dialogue stilted, and the writing weak. Two people recommended this book to me, neither veterans. Only a vet would know that repeatedly addressing subordinates as \\"Son,\\" the radio sequences and myriad other things are wrong and extremely grating for those of us who've also been there.I guess if you are into fantasy, this book is fine, but if you're looking for a realistic thriller, this absolutely isn't it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sea Of Shadows","review":"This is my first introduction to Jeff Edwards and I was impressed by his back ground and it truly paid off in this thriller. As they say write what you know, Edwards does just that giving the reader a detail account of the metal beasts that roam the ocean and the service people that must safeguard it's secrets while protecting their country and themselves. Look forward to reading more from this author in the near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as Clancy at his best","review":"For a buck and all the positive review, I figured, what the heck. I would have gladly paid the hardback price for this book, it's that good. Since Clancy has decided to produce drivel, Edwards fills the gap left quite nicely. Nicely researched and without too much military jargon, this is a fast paced action adventure with a very warm human side. It was as well edited as any Kindle edition I've read so it's technically enjoyable as well as being just plain good reading. You will not be disappointed in either this book or his second effort. I'm anxiously awaiting the third installment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Title Bait and Switch!!","review":"It has long been an unprincipled publishers' trick to simply retitle and reissue the same book so that unwary readers buy the same book twice. Sea of Shadows is Torpedo retitled. I thought Torpedo was fairly mediocre in the first place, and it both amused me and pissed me off to find that now I own two copies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"4 German submarines attack and cripple a U.S. carrier. Our President responds by sending 4 and only 4 surface ships to destroy these subs, and even after several battles with the subs leaves several of our ships badly damaged with many sailors killed, he refuses to send more assets... Why ? He insists that the world must see this as a fair fight ! And no dear readers, the author does not portray this president as a moron.A fair fight ?This is only believable if the president ( or the author ) is Jimmy Carter."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can it be so good and so bad?","review":"I read once that the least that you can expect from a technothriller is the plausability of the basic plot, that should be the \\"easy part\\" of the novel, building it up the hard one. The author managed to utterly disgust me with the plot, which is absolutely unbelievable. Who think that any country can sink a US warship, seriously cripple an aircarft carrier and still these acts would not be considered an act of war, and the culprit not chased down like UBL but just asked to resign? Can anybody explain me how can german combat planes appear over Gibraltar, flying from where???But the real surprise is that after such catastrophic macro plot, when the book is building up in the characters, it is actually quite good.Since imagining a plausible plot should be easier than doing the later I hope the author manages a book worthy of how good he can be"},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful, it is an re-edited work of Topedo. Do not buy!","review":"I had thought that this was another great work of Jeff Edwards, only to find its a slimmer version of the first book, \\"Topedo\\".If Jeff is going down the road with such edited work in the future, I am sorry to say that I will not longer support your work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sea of shadows a bad novel","review":"I am surprised at the positive feedback for this book. I found the story and execution to be very weak. I could not believe this author's portrayal of our Navy. He made our naval officers and personnel sound dumb and incompetent. He slapped together some research material on historic events and on torpedoes, but his own material was a disaster. I paid ninety nine cents for this Kindle novel and I think I paid too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a fun read","review":"I cannot understand the load of positive reviews of this book. The storyline is very, very unlikely. The plot is very lineair without any surprises at all. Sometimes characters are introduced, and do not return later in the book. There is no suspense, it is not gripping, and as a reader I do not feel bad for the casualties, or happy about the \\"victory\\". The Navy technical aspects of the story are well told, however the political aspects are totally underdeveloped. This was not a fun read ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent novel","review":"Again a terrific read from this author, great fast story line backed up with technical details and operational war fighting"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"This was a very good book that seemed to drag you right into the heart of it and include you in the theme!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is how it's done!","review":"Torpedo puts the THRILL back in Military Thrillers!

I enjoy military and spy thrillers and this fit the bill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding...A Good Read","review":"I met the author the day I bought the book, and we hit it off right away. As a retired Naval Officer and Anti-submarine specialist my entire career, I have to applaud Jeff for showing how much ASW is all about people thinking on their own, without the fancy computers. And he also captured the team work required to hunt, localize, and kill the most difficult of targets. The interaction between the officers and senior enlisted on board all of his Navy ships reflect reality...those who have mutual respect and listen to each other inevitably serve on very good ships. I especially enjoyed the way Jeff wrote the book, a sweries of relatively short chapters, each filled with just the right mix of drama and suspense. A hearty salute for this first work...and I am looking forward to his next effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read","review":"This is a great adventure and part of a three book series. If you like Tom Clancy, you will like Jeff Edwards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"While it was good to see the surface warfare teams get some just deserved praise the novel itself was a bit thin. I suppose its hard when compared to Hunt for Red October (The Novel not the crappy Film)but this novel lacked the depth required to be great. Certainly not enough technical elements and a plot that raced through at warp speed. I recomend you wait for Torpedo to hit the bargin bins before buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good military thriller at bargain price","review":"This book is well written and better documented about the intricacies of under sea warfare. The initial plot, well developed nevertheless, is not very convincing, but if you forget this point, it makes for a very interesting and pleasant reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast read","review":"Could not put it down.

Basis here is that Germany is failing and on the brink of collapse so they offer to sell 3 brand new high tech subs to a enemy county in exchange for their oil to help them with their energy crisis. The US tries to intervene and stop delivery of these subs and has an adventure doing so. This was a great quick read and hard to put down.

The Nylabone puppy key rings lasted much longer (1.5 months so far) compared to this toy. My 4 month old whippet started biting off the spikes of the blue-spiked ball after 2-3 minutes with the chew toy.

I wish more current shows TV could improve to meet this 40 year old standard. I can not say enough good about this drama, so many others have said it better.But, I am just wondering why Amazon streaming does not have the closed captions?We have Amazon Prime, but are wondering if it is really worth the price, since we already have Netflix which does have closed captioning. I have started to notice a lot of Amazon shows do not have CC. This is very discouraging especially since we are getting older and listening to the British accent can at times be frustrating..therefore -1 star. Oh well, if you hearing is excellent then you will be amazed at the breath and fluidity of this TV show.

Thomson often makes alterations to the written score. Sometimes Liszt's dynamic markings are ignored; at other times, melodic lines are reinforced with octave doublings. These changes are pretty clearly motivated by nothing more than a desire to communicate the emotion of the piece as vividly and powerfully as possible, and as such would likely meet with approval from Liszt. His disdain was reserved for those who played without feeling, and that's certainly not the case here.\\"Benediction,\\" like quite a few of Liszt's works, has a reputation for seeming too long. It's a credit to Thomson that he almost leaves you wanting more, after sixteen minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"ordinary people become murderers","review":"well it is safe to say that I survived this movie but I didnt quite like it all that much. there were things about it that were just too blah.

Mackenzie Astin(Sean Astin's brother) is the crazy guy in this movie and Natasha Gregson Wagner(Modern Vampires, Another Day In Paradise) is the annoying one in this movie. Field has written a book called Stranger Than Fiction and he tells the tale to a man at a bar. Astin murders a gay police officer and things go downhill from there. It just spirals into twists that are far too perdictiable but some funny, like the hobo in the back of the car. The old lady had the funniest death of them all.

Why is it that so many mystery writers flunk the ending part of their final exams? Granted there is a certain sustained interest in the transnational mechanics and flow of terrorist money which sustains the plot.The hero's relationship with his English spy girl friend is so sappy and unfulfilling that watching soap operas is more enjoyable. Reich must have felt that if he set the plot in Paris, he'd capture the tourist reader. Reich's ending is so flat and unpolished that one can imagine he was under time constraints to finish. Remember those college exam time blue books, where the clock is ticking away and you are scribbling away to fill all 12 pages.

I liked Reich's \\"Rules of Deception\\", it was a decent read. This, however, is so bad I could go on forever, complaining about the obvious ignorance the author shows regarding geography, technical devices, and so on. But what's most annoying is the totally uninteresting and unbelievable main characters and sidekicks, who act like they are either high on something, or complete sociopaths. It seems like Reich has got the idea \\"Oh, there must be some personal conflicts between them!\\", but he has absolutely no idea how to pull it off. We are often told the characters react strongly on something said - the problem is that there is absolutely nothing to explain the reaction, when looking at what was actually said! And this goes on and on and on, intermixed with the equally unbelievable love affair between the main characters.Poorly written on any account, this is such a waste of time and money I get mad every time I think of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads about as exciting as an accountant's spreadsheet","review":"Adam Chapel is a CIA agent who is actually a forensic accountant.

Teaming with Chapel is British agent Sarah Churchill. They must race with time to prevent another disaster of at least equal proportion to 9/11.A forensic accountant! Good G-d what will they think of next? Riech, a former banker, has written several previous novels concerning international high finance. All of them are considerably more successful thrillers than this one. There are many moments in this very long book that it reads about as exciting as an accountant's spreadsheet.

The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is because the mobile knocks as it swings, therefore, we don't even use it. My baby doesn't even notice the difference. And the other, and only true inconvenience, is that the tray is incredibly hard to lift. It sticks very bad, so it's best to either step on the frame as you pull up, or learn to work around it without lifting it. I would say that everything else DEFINATELY outwieghs any inconvenience.

We were manually rocking the swing and finally it broke down, I mean literally. Finally I went ahead and bought Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing from Fisher Price, its a bit expensive but totally worth it. My son has very sound sleep and loves the overhead toys, music and light. It hardly makes any noise, battery lasts long and easily carries around 20 lbs. By the way dont under estimate the cost of batteries. Moral of the story is Fisher Price is a lot better atleast the model I mentioned.

Graco promised a new motor the first week of June, then let us know they would replace the swing if we shipped it back (they would pay shipping). We didn't have the original box or one big enough. We took it back to Wal-mart. While the Graco was very comfy and nice to look at, there is obviously a problem with the design of the motors. We then went to B-R-U and purchased the Smart Stages Bunny Swing/Rocker by Fisher-Price. Our little one loves it!

With the exception of a few action sequences, this has \\"made for TV\\" written all over it and, in fact, in the US that's where it debuted. It's a loose remake of his 1991 Hong Kong film and was produced, on the cheap, in Vancouver. Nicholas Lea, best known for his character Krycek on the X-Files, must have done this between his appearances on that show which, at the time, was also filming in Vancouver. The DVD case says it's rated \\"R\\" but it's more along the lines of a \\"PG\\" film . . . lots of shooting but no blood. It's not a bad time waster, but it's just not very memorable. The ending sets it up for a TV series. This was originally a budget release from Simitar and now A-Pix. Besides some chapter breaks, the only extra that you get is a single frame of production credits. I paid just ... for this so I'm not complaining . . . too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Ok let me say that I saw this movie on TV a few years ago and I was intrigued when it was called \\"John Woo's Once a Thief\\" because the original (Chinese version, 1990)with Leslie Cheung and Chow Yun Fat is one of my favorite movies.

That was a good movie depending on if you can understand the chinese language or you can get it subtitled or dubbed but like always they make the dubbing sound like garbage. Anyway this sorry remake of a good movie has cheap acting and the movie overall itself I just didn't like. If you have seen the original then you may understand what I'm talking about.

Don't make the same mistake I did and buy this piece of junk thinking it was the real thing. I don't know how Woo sleeps at night knowing that he lent his name to this.

Although the singer does more clean singing than screaming in Stone Sour, it doesn't sound all that different than Slipknot, and contains vulgarities and other immature lyrics.The single \\"Through Glass\\" doesn't sound like any of the other songs on here (except for maybe the last track \\"Zzyzx Road\\" which will probably be another single) that are very forgettable mid-based numetal type songs. It's sad because when they go out of their way to make AOR friendly songs, they sound amazing, just like the more accessible tunes on the Slipknot albums.Overall I was very disappointed, and although I think he's a great singer, its tough hearing his voice get wasted through a bunch of very generic and boring songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"hard rock metal!","review":"Yeah i agree 5 stars is a must own cd but this one is 3.8 stars in my mind it's pretty kicks a** tough.Their first album sucked but this one is heavier and much better the slow songs are kind of okay but the fast ones are awesome they are hard rock and metal and i agree.The fast songs are more metal and the slow ones are hard rock but probably you would called the screaming metal.Anyway this is a good album to check out it's not a must own but it's pretty good to check out i recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Huge, Loud Guitars!","review":"hmmm.

Are you unable to stick with diets and exercise? This is the book for you. I lost 22 impossible-to-lose pounds smack in the middle of menopause with a stalled-out metabolism and a reflection in the mirror I barely recognized. Her book is the easiest reading in the world. Her plan is do-able, sustainable, it builds on its own success, and ultimately transforms you into the \\"you\\" under all those extra pounds. The power and ability to change yourself does not lie within another person, nor is it waiting in the pages of any book. It is within you, and what you need is someone to help you wake up the \\"diet within\\" you. Julia does that. Want a rhyme? You'll read the book in two seconds flat, then live in a way that will lose all your fat! It worked for me. Try it for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is about life changes - not dieting","review":"This is a wonderful read for anyone who has struggled with weight. This is the book that will take you step by step through how to make the necessary changes to your habits. It does not tell you how to diet but rather how to change your life to make healthy eating a new habit which will in turn make losing weight seem easier. Not only does the book help with eating habits, it also takes you through exercises to help you realize why you eat and how to deal with the emotions that cause you to eat. It is exactly what I have been looking for!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiration and humor!","review":"This book is wonderful! The story is inspiring..especially for those of us who have played the weight battle game. It is told with a wonderful sense of humor and includes new and very helpful tips, ideas and recipes.

Well she didn't need or have all this jazz when she lost all this weight, why should you? She is just trying to make more money. You don't need all that extra stuff she is trying to con you in to. If the book was motivating I would say buy that and use it, but it's not. So it is best to just overlook this whole thing entirely."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Start","review":"This book was wonderful in turning my thinking around.

Her extreme behaviors surrounding her unsuccessful weight loss attempts are foreign to me. I have always been \\"chubby\\", but have never let food control my life to the extent that Ms. Havey did.Pair that with the fact that, quite frankly, the book is poorly written... I had a very difficult time getting through it.I do think her process of eliminating vices one at a time is a good practice, but that is really the only positive tool I could glean.If you are just a normal, run-of-the-mill \\"chubby\\" person who is looking for inspiration, I don't think you will find it here. I sure didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sometimes we need more than a diet plan...","review":"I'm not sure how I found out about Julia Havey's book, but it was a lifesaver for me. I read it in one sitting. It was just what I needed. It's not a diet, but a lifestyle change. And I could relate to so much that this woman said. Seeing how she changed her life helped me. I needed to know that someone could relate to my personal situation; that I wasn't alone in the world. Not only that, but after I read her book, I emailed her and she immediately responded to my email, offering support and encouragement.Julia Havey offers wonderful advice about making small changes in one's lifestyle, whether it's eating or exercising. Maybe this book isn't what everyone is looking for, but people are different and everyone doesn't relate to the same things. The majority of people who read this book will be inspired by it, encouraged by it, and will lose weight by using its tips."},{"rating":"2","title":"Julia is inspiring","review":"Julia talks to you as a \\"real\\" person in the \\"real\\" world.

I also read Julia first book, \\"Awaken the Diet Within - Take Control of Life\\", and recommend reading it as well for a more indepth personal story.

I have never been able to actually read a diet book before. Usually I will glance at a diet book and never pick it back up again. I'll have to admit that this book was given to me. However, I started reading it and I couldn't wait to read the next chapter. I like the fact that Julia lets you know it is okay to go slowly with lifestyle changes. It was so hard for me to quit drinking Pepsi. Now I find myself not even wanting Pepsi but heading straight for ice water. Julia helped me to understand that if you \\"cheat\\" then just get back on the healthy road again, don't give up completely, which is what I used to always do. Now if I happen to eat something that I shouldn't, I don't feel like life is over and I should resort back to the old unhealthy habits. I know I can just continue on the slow road to healthy living.

It was indeed almost perfect right out of the box. The blade that comes with it is fantastic. I have already done some moulding projects and it was an ease using this saw.

The upfront controls of the bosch make it my favorite site saw, but the large table, lower price and less need for the quick bevel adjustments make the makita perfect for my shop. Hitachi saws are great for exterior trim and framing due to their light weight, but don't have the features that make the difference in trim work. (not to mention the fact that i cannot stand the noise they make) Dewalts are good saws, but also lack some features.

When coping basboard I need the slide(makita) to cut the straight portion, my Dewalt is unsatisfactory at the least for this. I hate flipping long boards over end to end because I dont have dual bevel. And the Dewalt blade arbor is insufficient to handle the 12\\" Blade. I know two people whos arbors failed and discarded the tool because of the cost to fix. You also get more flex in a 12\\" blade. Disagree? Try taking off a 16th of an inch with a 12 inch blade. Compared to other miter saws this makita is a 5, but compared to my imaginary ideal miter saw I give it a 4.

With the 12\\" capacity of this saw I can't believe I dinked around cross cutting on my table saw all these years. The only reason I did not rate it 5 stars is the poor dust collection.

I read through all the reviews of issues some people have had and ran into a few of them myself. They are good issues to have as it is important to recheck the mechanics and accuracy of the equipment before doing any detailed jobs. My saw kept losing it's positive stops angles when I was testing it out.My advice is when you get the saw - turn it over and tighten every screw and nut you find underneath. Then go through the maintenance steps in the manual and realign the blade tilt and fence - whether it needs it or not. Now you will have a great saw that is dead on accurate and confidence to maintain it's accuracy when ever needed.Enjoy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine Prokofiev","review":"This all-too-seldom heard symphony was a pleasure to find on CD, and the Ukrainians got it just right, with feeling and enthusiasm, on a technically well-made disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"This lil piece of worthless junk was hardly worth the 20 dollars i spent for it.

I have tried EVERYTHING out there, from store bought treatments, to vet recommendations, to home remedies. This product is the ONLY one that works. I have had a 100% success rate with it. It completely eliminates the urine smell, but also has a pleasant smell itself. Some treatments I have used will get rid of the smell for a few days, but then it always comes back. Urine-off gets rid of it for good. I will never use another product again."},{"rating":"2","title":"This really does work","review":"After alot of research for a product that would remove cat urine odor from my basement concrete floor, I settled on Urine Off. I had used a few other products that were cheaper, but they didn't do the job. I was very frustrated especially since the cat that was using my basement as a littler box, I took in after her owner couldn't care for her any longer. I've had cats all my life and have never had a problem until now. I used the Urine Off on the concrete floor and to my surprise, the odor was gone. I keep some on hand in case the odor returns, but it's been over a month and no smell has come back. It was easy to use and now I feel confident that the urine odor in my basement is gone. Thank you Urine Off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Urine off for Cats.","review":"Urine off is an excellent product to rid the home or other area that your cat may urinate on.

I have never written a review on any product that I have bought on Amazon. To express my distaste for this purchase I have written a review.I bought these sheets a month ago (May 2009). They were really soft and very comply. However after the 8th wash the sheets started to get sandy. It's been 2 months since I have had the sheet and they are very sandy. I am so dissatisfied with these sheets! I bought them because I wanted quality sheets that would last a long time. Now I am searching again online for sheets. I will probably throw these sheets away.Do not buy these sheets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feel like I'm sleeping at a resort","review":"Sheets are so comfortable.

Super soft and comfy. Nice rich purple color. Have washed them and still are just as soft and fit is great. Perfect if you need sheets with deep pockets too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely unimpressed . . .","review":"I was so unimpressed with these sheets that I returned them without even fully opening the package. All I had to do was reach my hand in to feel them and I was instantly disappointed. I have had high thread count sateen sheets before and loved them -- but these were terrible. I honestly didn't feel enough difference between these and cotton sheets to even contemplate keeping them. I requested the return authorization the day they arrived. I am still uncertain as to which sheets to recommend -- but I can firmly say that these are not worth their price. I was so excited based on so many positive reviews and so disappointed when the sheets came . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy these sheets. Not what you think you are getting!","review":"Look, I love Amazon stuff. Buy lots of it! BUT, this set of sheets has turned out to be way less than what my good money purchased. Here's the thing, after 6-9 months one expects high quality sheets to stand-up to wear and tear. The fabric on these sheets have started to \\"ball up.\\" Small fabric problems that make these sheets uncomfortable. Not a good purchase. Not the quality you might expect for your good money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shrinking Problem","review":"These are very comfortable sheets, but they shrunk, and take a lot of muscle to get all 4 corners of the fitted sheet on the bed. Because it is difficult to get them on securely, a corner will often pop off while we are sleeping."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've Had better","review":"I am not that pleased maybe could find a better thread count then this might return, it's for a full size but not on the spot it's to short and the corners are to far apart get a king size instead if yours is a Full sized and so on"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed!","review":"I was shocked when I took these out of the wrapping. They were like burlap and those who said that they were \\"soft\\" must have gotten different sheets than me. Before I had a chance to return them, they got into the washing machine---I will see if they get softer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rough sheets","review":"I was hoping these sheets would be soft out of the package. They were not. I washed them a few times just to see and they were still rough. Not horrible but certainly disappointed. I usually don't write reviews but if you are looking for soft sheets- these are not them. They are however well-fitted and seem very durable and think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sheets become less soft with washing","review":"I bought these sheets based on the terrific reviews here. And I have to say that after years of sleeping on cheap sheets, these feel good. We have a tempurpedic mattress and pillows and this set works well with them -- other sheets and pillowcases have fitted the pillows and mattress too tightly and the pleasant squishiness was lost. However, I'll note that I'm editing a previous review and would change my rating to 4 stars if I could. The hemming isn't perfect, they pilled a little bit after the first wash, and, most importantly, they seem to be becoming noticeably less soft with repeated washings. But they are a good value and I would consider buying a second set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy these!","review":"These are literally the worst sheets that I have ever purchased.The set that I received was rough coming out of the package AND was rough after washing and drying once. They are definitely not 500 TC, and they feel like 120 TC instead.I would not purchase these sheets again and strongly regret my purchase. Do not order!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly Terrible Sheets","review":"Unless you like to sleep on something similar to canvas, you should avoid these sheets. I was looking to replace a very soft set of sheets for my bed. I ordered these sheets after reading the description and other reviews. These sheets are not smooth or soft and truly do remind me of canvas.I did many washing cycles (at least 10), but the sheets did not improve.I don't typically write negative reviews, but I can't begin to express my disappointment with these sheets and hope I can stop others from making my mistake.If I hadn't washed them so many times trying to soften them up, I would have tried to return them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I have never found sheets this thick or rough. Egyptian cotton sheets that I have bought in the past have been soft and thin, but warm. These are obnoxiously thick, I tried washing them and I think it made them worse. If I wanted sheets this thick, I'd have ordered flannel because then they would have at least been soft."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feels like plastic","review":"These sheets are truly awful. I thought for the price that they would at least feel soft and hold up fairly well. They felt like plastic coming out of the packaging and I hoped that a few washes might improve the softness. They never got softer. They are warm, but scratchy and hard. It isn't so bad for the fitted sheet, but the pillow case and standard sheet are not comfortable. I would not recommend these sheets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sheets but check the seams","review":"Very satisfied with the quality of the sheets EXCEPT that on one of the pillow cases there was a 4 inch seperation on one of seams. This must have been missed by their quality control. It wasn't worth the hassel of returning it so I did a hand sewn repair."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"After reading the reviews I was anxious to try these out. After four washes I have to say I am incredibly disappointed in the way they have held up. The pilling and scratchiness is so bad I've removed them and won't be using them anymore. Initially they are shiny, turning softer after additional washes, but as I said - the pilling!! I've had sheets hold up better that were less expensive and lower thread count. I love the ample sizing of the sheets but won't be buying anymore of these sets.A strange thought, but I'm curious if the differences in the reviews has anything to do with the color or where they are manufactured. Mine were thyme."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL SHEETS after just 2 months!","review":"These are literally the worst sheets I have ever owned. They felt lovely at first touch, but they have pilled up and become scratchy and awful after just 2 months of on and off use. We use Frette and Pratesi sheets generally, so we know how to care for our sheets and those great brands hold up for DECADES without pilling. These are like what I slept on in highschool! Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Constantly shrinking over time","review":"At first we loved these sheets. We have a thick king-size mattress and they fit nicely--at least at first. Please understand, our mattress is not one of those insanely thick mattresses, just what seems normal for a modern, comfortable bed. The sheets were soft and we didn't have the problem that others noted with pilling. However, over time they continue to shrink each time we wash them until they no longer fit the bed. Getting the bottom fitted sheet on has become aerobic exercise and they \\"pop\\" off at least a couple of times each week. I would not recommend these to anyone. After a little over a year, I am going to have to throw them out and buy others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cotton Sheets","review":"I ordered these sheets as a housewarming gift for my son. They have been washed twice and are pilling. There is no were to contact and get a replacement and past the return time. I have no idea what my options are and how to proceed with a new set. Giving it a bad review based on poor quality and no option to contact seller for a exchange."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pilling","review":"These sheets are wonderfully comfortable on first use. However they do start to pill rather quickly. Because they were so comfortable, I bought a second set. Then the pilling started. They do not interfere with the comfort as yet, just find it a little disconcerting."},{"rating":"1","title":"These Sheets Feel Horrible","review":"I returned these immediately. They feel terrible for sheets that are somwhat expensive. I see a lot of positive reviews, but I cannot believe that anyone would want to sleep on these sheets - they are rough and feel like cheap polyester sheets. There is no way they are of the quality that Amazon describes them to be. There are many less expensive sheets that will feel much better than these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad pilling","review":"These sheets are fine enough, but I expected more. I guess you get what you pay for. Bad pilling after third washing. Also, the \\"sand\\" color I ordered is a bit yellow for my taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like sleeping on sand paper","review":"This sheets were very soft the first few times we used them. However, after washing the product 6-8 times they began to pile up and now are very coarse. I thought I was purchasing a high quality product but after 6 months of use I would not recommend these sheets, unless you like sleeping on 40 grit sand paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too heavy","review":"500 thread count sounded incredibly soft and light. I own several sets of Wamsutta Spring sheets, 300 or 400 thread count, which I bought at Macy's in San Francisco about 8 years ago. They were incredibly soft and light. But these Pinzon are heavy. It does not get too cold here in Texas, so I don't want heavy sheets EVER. I returned the unopened set of sheets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect Sheets","review":"Got the bluish color and I like it. The material seems sturdy and durable and it is relatively soft. If a little softer, I would have given it 5 stars. I will probably order another set of these as they do seem to be good quality sheets."},{"rating":"1","title":"100% junk","review":"these are the biggest pieces of junk.

Would not recommend at all. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"500? Really?!","review":"I honestly do not believe these sheets are true to the 500 thread count claim. You would think that sheets with that high of a thread count would hold up after washes (and ideally get softer). These sheets were soft initially but became so rough. I washed them in the gentle cycle, warm, and dried on low as well. They are fraying now and so rough. Ugh, what a waste of money! Also, the fitted sheet is not very deep. My mattress is about 13-14 inches deep, and the sheets do not cover all the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic-like, too thick, not soft, returned them.","review":"I liked the pinzon towels so I thought I would try these despite some of the review. The reviews are right. The sheets are horrible. I returned them and got way better sheets at Walmart for less money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fabulous except where there's pilling","review":"I'm so disappointed with these Pinzon sheets. At first they seemed perfect--great feel to the touch, luxurious sheen, beautiful rich chocolate color 500 thread Egyptian cotton King sheets. I had previously purchased the Pinzon 500-thread in mint color a couple of years ago in Queen, and have been just thrilled with their performance.But with these, after about 4 washings, I noticed the fabric is rough where our bodies usually rest on the sheets. Everywhere else, still smooth and silky. The search for no-fail luxury sheets continues I guess. And these were not cheap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Soft as Sand Paper","review":"This item is adverstised as \\"500-Thread-Count\\", but they feel more like course, stiff canvas. Definitely NOT even close to 500-Thread-Count.

I never played the violin in my life,and could tell that I didn't want to be playing out of this thing. I read the review and it sounded good, but it I think it was ment for another violin! It is cheap and it literally is! I rated it one star because it wouldn't let me rate it a zero. However,austin bazaar customer service was quick on answering my return questions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what the picture suggests","review":"I've never written a review on Amazon before, but I finally have to because I was really disappointed by this product. Yes, it's a $40 violin and I shouldn't expect much for that price, but the violin we received in the mail looked absolutely nothing like the one in the picture. It's not clear if it's even made of wood. What we got was a dull brown, sickly sheened, plastic-y looking thing. No sign of wood/fake wood/wood grain, anything. It was a gift that I had sent directly to the receiver so I didn't have a chance to quality screen it first, and I'm pretty bummed about how it turned out. Luckily my friend didn't seem to mind :) Otherwise I would definitely be returning it.So long story short, don't let the picture deceive you. This violin is probably a serviceable instrument for having cost $40, but it sure ain't pretty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great violin !","review":"I bought it cheap, Overall I was pleased with the violin.

Do yourself and your teacher a favour by spending an extra $100 and get a playable instrument. A crappy instrument will put you off. It's not worth it. You may luck out and get one of these that are 'OK-ish' but the quality is not consistent and most are dreadful. You can get a decent instrument for another $75 to $100. Worth spending the small extra than throwing away $60 on this, unless you want to spend all of your precious lesson time trying to tune up! Only my humble opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindness","review":"I bought this product for the intention to just play along with music by ear and learn some tunes in a fun inexpensive way. It came with some minor flaws that the seller and amazon amazingly took care of right away!

He had been saving his money all summer and I figured it was better spent on a musical instrument than a video game! I thought that it would be a wood violin, but it seems to be a sort of plastic. It is great for what we need right now as he explores his new obsession! I will be signing him up for lessons soon and the teacher will tell me if it is truly a good beginner violin, or if we just wasted our money!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not usuable.","review":"We were very disappointed in the product. It looks nice if that was all you were going to do with it. We bought it for our 7 year old granddaughter. Our son-in-law was not able to get the strings to tighten properly. The wood piece that we assumed was to keep the strings tight would pop out whenever he tried to tighten the strings. He said the bow did not work either. So all in all it is not usuable and a great disappointment for a little girl. We would like to send it back for a full refund if possible.

From beginning to end, this is an \\"adult\\" fun film. There are a number of raunchy moments that only D'Onofrio could make seem real and necessary, and which only Gregory Hines could field with compassion and dignity!This is the story of two misfits who together don't quite ever make a whole... but who are delightful to tag along with. It's really hard not to get caught up in their adventures. Right to the final scenes, it's just too funny! The secret to the film is that it is composed of characters that are every-day folks, and don't we really enjoy watching ourselves?This is a five star film. Very enjoyable.

Worth the watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it, and since its a Euro production I'll forgive the hit on Palin.","review":"Very funny, surprisingly good CGI and costumes. Since this is a Euro/Aussie production making the USA the heavy (in a funny way) is to be expected.Best Finnish, German, Australian film production I've ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have been a great 30minute movie","review":"I saw the trailer for this a few months ago, and was excited to see it available on Amazon Instant Video. All of the scenes on the moon, the space battles, and the invasion in NY are well done. Costuming is good and decent acting.It all falls apart though with several interludes where they focus on a campaign manager and the President of the US. The scenes are poorly written, poorly acted, and do little to move the story forward. I really wish this would have just been a straight-forward Moon-Nazis-Invasion movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Just a B-Movie it's a B+ Movie","review":"Yes, this is not a major theatrical release, but it does a lot with such a low budget. The FX are very good for the cost of the movie. The acting is excellent. They really tried hard. They call this a comedy, but I found it to be more of a dramady. Not too cheesy... very nicely done. Received my copy the Friday before the official release date. I know I will be watching this DVD again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept, poorly executed","review":"Movie had some funny moments but predominantly dragged on. The humor was corny, the plot muddled, the ending lost on me. It really SEEMED interesting from the trailers, very novel idea, but just dragged in between too few good parts, which were mostly shown in the trailer.Waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I only rented it","review":"Cover looked good, description sounded good, movie was barely OK and sometimes hard to watch. Not a bad premise but could have been much better. Glad I only rented it. The whole idea of Nazi's colonizing the dark side of the moon waiting for an opportunity to invade earth to take over after losing WW2 is hard to swallow, even if you are good at suspending reality and getting into imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"less than impressed","review":"I was looking forward to this movie when it was originally released in theaters but the release was so limited and lasted not that long at all that I never got to see it I knew it was going to be a spoof type sci fi flick but...the story line sucked, the dialogue dragged and while I'll freely admit I enjoyed the lead actresses performance somewhat...if only because of my weakness for blondes..by and large I just got to say this one left a bit to be desired. I don't know...maybe it'll grow on me later"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurb Flick","review":"While it does have a few moments of humour and some pretty good special effects, it's still an absurb flick and plot line."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"B\\" Movie doesn't have to be mean \\"bad\\"...","review":"There is little I appreciate more than a movie that successfully makes fun of itself. Don't go into this expecting a serious big budget sci-fi opus. This is a little film that pretends to be big and provides a lot of laughs. Definitely worth a rent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic fun B movie","review":"Have watched this film's progress on line for years. When I recieved it, I was not disappointed. It is a good fun film with loads of satire. It is not for the thin skinned politically correct. Definitely recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Iron Sky Fail","review":"Great concept, utterly ruined by nasty political rhetoric. It could have been funny, smart and hip, but if that's what passes for smart and hip, I'll pass. I seldom feel bad about wasting my time watching a movie, but this was one of those times. Straight out of the player and into the trash can.One star because there is no Zero star."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only great thing about this movie was the preview","review":"Husband endured the whole thing but I gave up 1/3 of the way through. Premise was fantastic and had the potential to be a very funny, over-the-top film. I think I was expecting something campy along the lines of the musical, The Producers. But execution was embarrassing: direction, editing, characterizations-- all clunky. It made me marvel yet again at what actors are willing to do to be onscreen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, except for fans of cheesy movies.","review":"I rented this movie knowing that what I was about to watch was going to be very low budget and very non-impressive. My immature side talked me into watching this just so I could say to myself that I watched a movie with Nazi's on the moon that invaded Earth. ...And they did. And of course I was dissapointed in myself for spending the money on such a horribly done movie with a pathetic plot as the credits began to show at the end of the movie. When will I learn?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ad is misleading, there is no digital copy","review":"The ad does advertise that there is a digital copy. However the disc I received did not have this feature. And per the return policy of amazon it can't be returned since I removed the wrap. The only way you can know if the digital copy is there is to remove the wrap where you usually find the insert with the code to activate the digital copy.

Amazon please update the ad to be consistent with what is really delivered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brave effort","review":"Not an unqualified success but still a remarkable, clever and very brave film. Sure the Nazis have to be stopped, but they ain't all bad. Well, at least one of them isn't! The story, and the film's style are reminiscent of the early Flash Gordon era of sci-fi story telling; but profoundly modernized. Where Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow fell flat on its face, this film does not. I was thoroughly entertained by the fast-paced story and enjoyed the dark humor and satire that permeates the film. The actors work hard and the heroine in particular turns in an excellent and likeable performance. The production values are simply amazing; especially when you consider the limited budget and where his film originated. So if you want something sci-fi, something different, then you'll enjoy Iron Sky as much as I did. Believe me the film makes far more sense than dismal outings such as the recent \\"Battleship\\" movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is what it is...","review":"If you can accept the idea of steampunk nazis on the moon, everything that follows is enjoyable in this campy sci-fi along the same vein as Doc Savage, Buck Rogers and Flash Gordan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nazi's in space need I say more?","review":"Nazi's in space need I say more for a movie that's not meant to be taken too seriously. I recommend this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I can appreicate the work put into this film. However, I found it disappointing. As far as entertainment value the trailer was much better. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it wasn't a complete waste of time. If you need to kill time, and can bear to sit through an hour plus of sophmoric cheesiness and worn out cliches, this is an option."},{"rating":"2","title":"Digital Copy is PC only","review":"It was fine to get the Blu-ray with the digital copy but although I own both PCs and Macs, I prefer to use iTunes for my digital copies.

He goes into a black neighborhood and acts Black BECAUSE HE DOESN'T REALIZE HE'S BEEN TURNED WHITE. AH TRUE COMIC GENIUS! WHAT COMEDY! WHAT A BRILLIANT SENDUP ON THE HUMAN CONDITION AND RACE RELATIONS! HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHA Maybe this would have been funny when I was in 7th grade, not so much now. On second thought, it wouldn't have been funny then either.

I blanched, and kind of got ill (and I have a pretty strong stomach). The movie ended my interest right here. Is it fair for me to make a review without seeing the entire film? Yes, it is unfair. I am saying, however, that once you see something extremely offensive in a film, it kind of kills your interest in continued viewing.But, hey, that's just one cheloveks opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK","review":"Kind of corny, acting not that great.

I threw it in the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly Terrible. Wasted Potential.","review":"I'm not sure if I can articulate how bad this movie is, but I will try. So you've probably seen the trailers for this, just like I have. Nazis from the moon, dirigibles, guns, explosions, satire, Sarah Palin--ripe with comedic potential! Unfortunately Iron Sky didn't deliver on anything that, well, on anything at all really. We have a very sinusoidal and ultimately anti-climactic storyline, boring characters, unfunny jokes, and a lame space battle at the end that you could've just fast-forwarded to and not missed a single thing. This movie had so much potential, but it fails to deliver on any one item. I'm often left wondering what I'm supposed to be watching. Is it a serious space opera? No wait, it's a satire. No wait, it's space noir. I really, really wanted to love this movie. I saw the terrible reviews for this movie before I bought it. But if you're like me, you'll want to watch it anyways and judge for yourself. I suggest you don't get your hopes up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly cliched and really not very funny","review":"Well, I'm not sure who the audiance for this movie might be but it sure isn't older, conservative folks.

I have not seen it on Blu-Ray or DVD, so I can't comment on whether the \\"special features\\" make it worth the \\"bargain\\" price of over $35, but I can tell you what I thought of the movie.I give the movie one star just because the CGI effects were not a total disaster but it's all downhill from there. I know it's meant as a parody of sorts but even as that, it fails. The film is utterly unfunny and un-American. I can't decide what I disliked most: the bastardized version of the \\"Star Spangled Banner\\" they played during a scene showing President Sarah Palin (that's not a typo) beating U.N. delegates with her red shoe, the African-American actor that played a white man during the majority of the movie or the fact that, in the end, they try to portray, as sympathetic figures, not the Americans, but the Nazis.If you remember only one thing from this review, let it be this: I watched \\"Iron Sky\\" so you don't have to."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun movie, Fantastic CGI","review":"This was a pretty funny movie.

Fun flick, I hope the make some more quality movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly enjoyable movie","review":"First, I have no taste. I have been told this for years. I love this movie. I've watched it a couple of times since I got it. The action is well done, the humor is most excellent, and the acting is perfect. The special effects are what you'd expect out of a much larger budget movie, and the story is great.No, don't go in to this expecting \\"Lord of the Rings\\". Instead, expect \\"Tremors\\", \\"Wild Zero\\", \\"Rocky Horror\\" (3 of my favorite movies....). It's funny, it's action packed, It's fun to watch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"B-movie fun, you'll enjoy every minute as long as you realize it's not trying to be Scorcese or Speilberg...","review":"Very silly, a tad forced in places, and who gives a crap? Pure, B movie fun, as was intended. Amazing effects considering their $10 million budget. This movie was silly, had a message but delivered it with the subtlety of a giant rubber mallet. It was the funnest load of crap I've ever watched. Highly recommended.(Note: this review was originally a reply to Hydra's review, but I decided to post it on its own.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun for sci fi nerds!","review":"This movie is total camp... It's a blend of all kinds of sci fi memes, mostly from the 80s and 90s with a fantastic tie-in to the 00s. Don't expect it to be Star Wars (or even Space Balls for that matter). But a fun watch anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silly and Funny Farce / Satire of possible NeoCon Future for USA","review":"Tounge in chesk look at the political climete of the second decade of the century with the always popoular Nazi Enemy.

The movie is actually very well made, smart and very, very funny. Sort of Dr. Strangelove meets Airplane by way of Mel Brooks, only the Nazis don't technically dance.

A unfortunately small number of them though. Those moments were pretty hilarious, but a lot of the time it was just plain stupid. This movie had been hyped up so much that I had pretty high expectations, and it didn't deliver. The acting was ok out of most of the characters.

It started out silly, and the absurdity got exponentially more intense as the movie went on.Yes, the acting may be off at times. The writing may be poor at times. The direction may be clunky at times. But none of this matters. If anything it enhances the \\"expensive B movie\\" feel.If I have one complaint about this movie, it's that it made me appreciate the potential awesomeness of a Sarah Palin presidency. That's scary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title Misleading","review":"I was hoping for a detailed description of this incredible story of survival, such as has been written in \\"The Land of the White Death\\" or \\"South\\" by Shackleton (both excellent and richly detailed books). In author Robert's defense, it is quite apparent that there is little information available - what is could have been covered in a magazine article. While the book is interesting in its own right, my criticism lies in that the Title is misleading - it is more about his reseach on this subject than the actual historical record."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short story","review":"If you read the \\"Editorial Review\\" for this book, you've read the story. The rest of this 288 page book is about how the author researched the story.If you want a good research story, get this book. If you want (like me) a Jack London/Shackleton story, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be titled \\"The Search for the Story of Four Against the Arctic\\"","review":"This book is NOT the story of the four Russian sailors shipwrecked for four years in the Arctic. It is the story of the author researching the story of the four Russians. He does uncover some interesting bits about early Russian and Norwegian Arctic exploration but it is all buried in 288 pages of the author's self importance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything it says it is, and more.","review":"It is difficult to understand why anyone would state as a COMPLAINT that \\"The book is about David Roberts and his research into a survival story.\\" Yes, that is EXACTLY what it is. Roberts' story-within-a-story is accessable, immediate, often humorously self-disparaging, and it shows a drive for knowledge which one can only admire.I was captured by the end of the first paragraph of the introduction, and I couldn't put it down. Great stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"An absolute waste.","review":"Only about 1/4 of this book is about the Russians shipwrecked for 6 years. The rest is about the story of researching the Russians. Roberts has nothing but vitriol for authors who have come before him. Roberts' way of detailing his research is so painstakingly boring that you'll think you're reading an accounting textbook. If Roberts sent a FAX to someone seeking the translation of a map, he'll not only tell you about the FAX but how fast he received a reply. Adventure has here been turned into how words have been translated into different languages and lost their original meaning. Of the dozens of Arctic and Antarctic survival books available this is among the worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needed an editor","review":"I really enjoyed many aspects of \\"Four Against the Arctic\\", the story of the four stranded Russians, how the author followed up every lead to learn more about the original story (which many reviewers did not like) and the way the author tied in many other survival stories. A good book as far as content goes. But what I did not like about it was the jumbled and highly ornamented writing style. Not content to use a simple adjective when an obscure one will do, Mr. Roberts seems to write with a thesaurus at his side. There's no indication that the publisher assigned an editor to the project. That was mistake. \\"Four Against the Arctic\\" would have been a far better book if it had been edited. Although it was a relief to finish it, I still value \\"Four Against the Arctic\\" for the content. Glad I only paid two bucks for a used copy - thank-you Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit misleading","review":"I got this book because the title seemed to suggest it would be a story about FOUR AGAINST THE ARCTIC. It's not. The book is an endless description of David Roberts research into the story I hoped to learn more about. While Roberts telling of his story is creative and his research thorough, this reader would have appreciated having a title that described what the book was really about. This is not the first time I have seen a book title by this publisher that seems to mislead readers just a bit. It's disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ego Trip","review":"While the parts about the Russian sailors are interesting, the book rapidly degrades into the author's ego trip as the book becomes more about what a clever researcher he is and less about the sailors. What a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"I read it anyway","review":"I'm an incurable fan of anything about the Artic or Antartic. Maybe because of my Norwegian roots. I devour this stuff, so David Robert's self-interest couldn't stop me. Nevertheless I have to agree with some of the other reviewers. There wasn't a whole lot in these 304 pages about the four Russian sailor/survivers. Robert's research at Cambridge got pretty slow, but when he finally arrived on Svalbard's shores, his own adventure, it was better. What troubled me was his continuous disdain of previous writers and even his disdain for his fellow adventurers on Svalbard. I think I learned a bit about Polar Bears though. How awesome that people can survive in these extreme environments. I'd like to try it some day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be Titled: Find the Hidden Story","review":"This narrative is an excellent account of how people can survive in the face of a challange. Unfortunately, the author details the actual writing of the tale much more effectively than dramatizing the task of wintering the arctic. The actual story, (which is hard to find in the book), and the photography would have made a very interesting cover story of a National Geographic. What is ultimately presented turns out to be a mediocre story of how the auther did toil to research the information in his book. But that was not about what I had wanted to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely Not a Survival Story","review":"I hate to write this, but I don't want others to make the mistake I did and pay $20 or more for this book. If you expect this to be a riveting survival story, as I did, you would be wrong. The book is about David Roberts and his research into a survival story. Details about the libraries he visited, the books he read, how he found various documents, his correspondence, his disdain for all previous efforts to document this story, his ability to read various languages, even friends of his family, etc. I only made it through 1/3 of the book. The rest of the book appears to be more about David Roberts and his trip to the arctic. I wanted to learn about the \\"Four Against the Arctic\\", instead I learned all I'll ever need to know about David Roberts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surviving the first 79 pages is a book in itself","review":"I was looking forward to reading about the harrowing adventures of these men, but can't get past page 79. This book was more about a writer doing research rather than the survivor's tale. I often found myself reading a paragraph, taking a bite of lunch, only to bring my eyes back to the page and reading the same paragraph again. Hence, 79 pages read after having the book for 3 weeks. I guess I'll put this book up for adoption now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Four Against the Arctic: Shipwrecked for Six Years at the Top of the World","review":"This was a fascinating book. I enjoyed it so much I bought another copy to give to my brother."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Goes Nowhere","review":"I kept going with this book because I felt it just had to get better at some point-but it doesn't. As other reviewers have pointed out, this is a story about research, not about the four men who survived the shipwreck. I was hoping the polar bears would get the whole boring lot of them, but no luck with that, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough information for a book","review":"This is an amazing story. However, most of the book is about writing the book. I don't care who he spoke to and where he read things. He should just tell the story. However, there isn't enough material for a book. Quite a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best toaster oven on the market today.","review":"This is truly a great product. With the digital timer there is no guessing about time and temperature. The 1600 watt quartz heating system is beyond any small oven that I have used. I don't even have to preheat. It reaches the set temperature within a minute. The convection feature is also very nice by reducing your cooking time on many products.I was disappointed with the size. If they had made it 2 inches longer it would have been large enough for a 9 x 13 baking dish, the most common size.There is one more issue that was disappointing. The baking pan is covered with a non-stick coating that scratches even from the food. It needs to be improved upon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Good","review":"I have always had small toaster and or convections overs, to save money and don't always need the power of my new JenAir Kitchen I just had installed (LOVE IT). When I only cook for myself, I use the small oven (Krups). For the price this oven is a BIG BIG MAJOR flop, it gets hot all over when cooking, you can burn yourself, the door does not operate correctly, jams, when cooking the sides and top of the door and frame turn brown from cooking, instead of venting. This is what other write ups also say, I should have learned from their mistakes.My recommendation is that I would PASS on this Krups, especially for the price, where is the craftmanship, attention to details and quality of the product, it does not exist.This is the most expensive Convection and or toaster oven I have ever bought and would strongly recommend that you look at cheaper models with same features, and based on write ups like this one choose any maker but this one.Good Luck if you chose this turkey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Krups high end toaster oven","review":"This oven works very well - just cooked a chicken in it and it turned out evenly cooked and browned.

The only other recent Mahler 2 in this league is Thomas-San Francisco, and this one is better. The recorded sound is great and the orchestra is in top form. Fischer captures that elusive 'Mahler sound' here. Many recordings of this symphony don't seem to caputre the extreme volume contrasts in this piece, but this recording finally does. The ppp is terribly quiet, and the big climaxes are huge.

This was the first one I read and it was Sorry, The stories were incredibly dense and redundant. I have read comic books with better erotica and literary skills. I have a hard time putting a book down, even when I do not like it, but reading this was awful. I am astounded that anyone enjoyed this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It","review":"Once again, don't pay such close attention to the reviews. It is all a matter of personal opinion. I really enjoyed both of Zane's stories. I just love everything that she writes. Her style, her description words, and sexual scenes. Zane is just awesome! She hasn't written anything I haven't enjoyed. The twin story was wild. I also enjoyed Delusions. It was comical to me. Another author I believe is a star writer is Shonda Cheeks. I truly enjoyed it.

Each story is what I would describe as being sweet and sappy. If you are expecting detailed love scenes, then this is not the book for you. It was surprising to see Zane describe sex as, \\"Doing the do\\" when she has never been one to hold back her tongue or should I say pen, on the matter of sex. So, this book was an ok read.

I would not recommend this book. The characters are not well developed. They're not really even developed. The Tree in The Giving Tree travels a greater emotional distance than any of these characters. The dialogue is not witty. The plot is weak and the book is not fast paced.It is an OK read for the price, especially if you've got some time on your hands and you'd spend the $3.99 on something more fleeting, like a Starbuck's coffee. Some of the character names are so silly they become annoying. (Lord and Lady Creamcroft? Is this story taking place in Candyland.)

Of course the interesting part was that Nessa wanted to be scandalous and Jack wanted her to save his reputation.

Wikipedia! I can't name a single professor who would accept that on a paper, but somehow, that's perfectly acceptable in the textbook publishing world. And some of the sources aren't even cited at all! And don't get me started on the perspective bias that is in there. One incident of a man who murdered five people was insinuated to be due to a miscommunication/bad persuasion issue, but when I found information outside of the book on the incident, there was no such causation mentioned...and the author had the death count off.Bottom-line is, although there is certainly useful information in here, but the book is constructed rather poorly, and based upon that alone, it's incredibly hard to trust the text. Certainly not worth the money spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete waste of time...","review":"The author is so very opinionated about politics that reading it is difficult.

There are some good, often surprising, stories in this books with characters who could as easily live in the present as in the \\"Roaring Twenties\\" generation.However, the editing on this Kindle edition is a joke! Every two pages or so there were blatent spelling and grammar errors- disturbing to the point that I almost did not want to continue reading it. Free Kindle edition or not, no one should let loose on the public such haphazard and poor editing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"Fitzgerald has established that he _can_ write, and well in his other works. This one, however, leaves more than a little to be desired. Cartoonish brassy debs and Horatio Alger-style golden boys with island paradises mark the basic theme. Futher, Fitzgerald can't seem to finish a paragraph without some reference to \\"darkies\\" or some more insulting epitaph. I mean - Twain's references were bearable, because we have the feeling that he's on the right side. But Fitzgerald's omniscient narrator (read: Fitzgerald) is pretty objectionable in his characterizations. And then he makes the cardinal sin of being decidedly unclever with the story. Even Maugham is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameful amount of typos, even for a free book!","review":"I happen to love this book, and I love F. Scott Fitzgerald even more. So I was appalled at the number of typos in this Kindle book's copy. I understand that this Kindle book is free, but does that mean its final version doesn't deserve to be properly proofread?I was already feeing funny about reading a book like this via Kindle. (My Kindle was a gift, by the way.) I vowed to only buy books that I already owned in hard or soft copy, just out of principle. I bought this book to read on the plane and couldn't even get through its first story without becoming a little bit angry and sad. I finally just gave up and will now delete this from my Kindle \\"library\\".This convinces me that in being converted to a Kindle book, every \\"real\\" book is in danger of losing some of its dignity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, engrossing short stories","review":"Fitzgerald may not have been overly fond of his short stories, but his writing skill and insight shine through anyway. In The Ice Palace and Bernice Bobs her Hair and the Four Fists in particular, Fitzgerald captures individuals struggling with themselves. Who/what should they be, and why? While I wasn't too fond of the pirate story, as it lacked these elements, the other stories in the book show a depth of understanding and introspection that makes for a wonderful, thoughtful read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of typos (but great stories)","review":"Don't buy this particular printing because it is FULL of editing errors, typos, missing words, spelling mistakes, missing or misplaced quotation marks, etc. I can see that it was printed on the day I ordered the book, so it must be one of those books that they scan into a computer and print-to-order without editing.

I think he used to overcook it a little bit, attacking notes a little harshly, but now I'm guessing he knows how to stay within himself better as age will make you do that (plus there is some studio magic going on). Don't get me wrong, he sounds fanstatic, especially at his age.Duran Duran is a very unique band in that they started with extreme pop status the overshadowed some fantastic songwriting, and when the pop status left them, all that we left was the talent.

The rest are not very good at all.The song, Taste The Summer is, in particular, quite bad and annoying.No song on this album can compare to songs like Hungry Like The Wolf and Ordinary World, which were good songs.This band just doesn't strike me as having much originality (at the present time), nor does it seem like they would be much of a band to watch at a concert.Just my opinion, others may really like them."},{"rating":"1","title":"THESE ASTRONAUTS DONT FLY","review":"ASTRONAUT IS THE WORST ALBUM BY THE WORST BAND IN HISTORY.AVOID AT ALL COSTS.IF YOU HAVE THIS CD,YOU HAVE A LOUSY TASTE IN MUSIC.GET WISH YOU WERE HERE FROM PINK FLOYD INSTEAD.roxy music are legends whereas dd are a fad."},{"rating":"2","title":"a comeback-dream for their fans","review":"its so good to know the boys are back, and its better to know that this is one of their best times together!an album with pure pop duranish style at its best.

Most of the 5 star reviews are from people who would give ANY new DD a 5 star review, no matter what it sounded like.There are maybe four good songs, the singles, love you more and finest hour. the rest would've been cut from any previous DD album.The true believers will rave on, but deep in their hearts they know better. Be honest, if Rio is 5 stars, this is only two or three.And why oh why did they cut \\"Beautiful Colours\\"? It was the best new song on the tour before the album came out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Band is the best, Astronaut music is most worthy","review":"So why the 1-star rating? Because the CD is copy-protected so badly that it will not play on almost any computer CD drive and those are all my stereo is hooked up to. It also has problems on certain car players although it did work on mine. This is completely unacceptable."},{"rating":"2","title":"They are back!!!","review":"Well, Duran Duran is finally back again! Thats right. All five members are back together again and this is their first album toghether in a long time. The songs are a mix of their original style and that of the 90's. Roger Taylor is back drumming in the style that we loved so much in the 80's. Simons voice sounds as good as it ever did! Amazing. Yes, studio technology and recording today can do amazing things for vocalists but the voice is still a voice and Simon Le Bon's sounds as young and fresh as in the 80's. Wow! The complex and melodic bass lines of John Taylor are so great to hear again. The simple yet always melodic guitar leads of Andy Taylor bring us back again to vintage Duran. And as always Nick Rhodes works his magic on the electronic side of things adding fresh new techno type riffs to the whole mix. This CD has something for everyone and easily crossovers into a variety of genres. Great stuff! Four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"All back together?!.....great idea!!","review":"The first cd that I bought from them was Liberty 1990, at that time not all the original members were playing, and I still like a lot that album, I heard some radio songs with all the original members, at my point of view at that time, they were fine. But this album it is GREAT, all the songs in it may show their experience. It has a great combination of music: pop, rock, balads, etc.Simon Le Bon sounds as their first years, John Taylor's bass rocks, Andy Taylor's guitar, Nick Rhodes' Keyboard and Roger Taylor's drums play in perfect harmony. What do you get: A perfect album. You may found it pop, but I will asure you that you will like it.Some people may like Duran Duran at their early years, some, like me, may like latter years, well, this one is for everybody, I hope they still together for long time, so we can enjoy this type of music. Buy it, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This is a great album! I recently saw the band in concert and as they started performing their first song all I could think about was how great it was that they were all together again. I feel the same way whenever I listen to the album or look at the cover art.I love the beat to Sunrise, Want you More, Astronaut, Nice. As a slow song, I love the sound of Chains.I highly recommend this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gift!","review":"These knee pads are very tough and they made an excellent Christmas present for my dad who has been doing lots of home improvement projects lately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Winderful insight into the men behind the men at the healm!","review":"The author eloquently serves up a biographical feast of the fathers of the leaders! It's not so much an ideological review of the fathers' influences on the Presidents but an analysis of the influence (or lack of) influence the men had fostering. The most interesting review if that of Andrew Grant and his father's strict upbringing, without which, we would not have had this military leader and President."},{"rating":"2","title":"I learned a great deal from this book!","review":"I realized after reading this book how much of what I read here was totally new to me, although I have read a good deal about the presidents. It seems, though, that much more focus is always put on the mothers of presidents, and the fathers are somewhat overlooked. I really enjoyed learning what sort of fathers inspired their sons to be presidents!This book is scholary and well written. At times, the language is a bit formal and for my taste, a little overly flowery. It has the feel of a book written in the early part of the 1900s---which is certainly not all a bad thing! It's not written in the casual style of so many books today.I was especially fascinated to read about Teddy Roosevelt's father. I had no idea he was such a well loved person, and as the author says, the closest to a perfect father of any profiled here. The story of Gerald Ford's birth father and then his step-father should be an inspiration to step-fathers everywhere.Definately worth a read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Awesome","review":"What a beautiful bit of music!!

I thought that the story in the beginning was incredibly slow, and not at all suspensful. In fact, I kept losing interest in the book and stopped reading it shortly after I began. Finally i decided to finally finish it off so i never had to see it again. This book truly left me bored, and thinking \\"so what?' about it. I think I am going to stick to familiar names like Pike and Stine and not try to venture off for a while unless something really looks good. Oh well, guess I will send it to another used book store for some other person to find."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makita 3 1/4 plunge router","review":"This was a big dissapointment, usually makita puts on a good show. But not this time. The tollerance in the plunge mechanism is terrible. It allows the router bit over 1/16 of movement from side to side while plunging the router. I thought there was something wrong with the router I was sent so I asked amazon to replace it, they did and the second one was worse than the first. Then I asked the Makita rep, his response was,\\" It must be a knock-off.\\" When I asked him to come take a look he declined and advised me to return it. One of the worst tools I have ever bought..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great - but heavy!","review":"No lack of power. Exceptionally solid and powerful tool. I've never bogged it, even in exotic hardwoods. Bit changing is teriffic. This is the ideal table mounted router. Great height adjustment, etc. Downsides: The single noisiest tool in the shop, heavy jerk on starting, and mine managed to vibrate the lock lever loose. It's also very heavy. This is a big tool, and it's hard to feel comfortable using it freehand until you're used to working with a router."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked Great, for two minutes!","review":"I realize that every manufacturer builds one or two lemons, so I can't be too harsh on Makita. For the most part, they make great tools. I didn't get a chance to test the router's cutting ability, however I can say that it is very heavy and I would not use it for too much handheld routing. I still think I would recommend this router for a table mount to someone else based on Makita's history."},{"rating":"2","title":"No need to spend more money - this is tops","review":"This router is exclusively used in my router table due to it's size and power. I *LOVE* the variable speed and soft start. You can run the big bits at much slower speeds and not get vibration or burning. Bit changing is straight forward (equipped with shaft lock), and they never jam (I use 1/2\\" shank only). There is NO REASON WHATSOEVER to pay more money elsewhere for any other 3+ HP router, or even a shaper - short of a factory production line.This is a tool that I will enthusiastically encourage anyone to buy, without any shortcoming at all - A GREAT TOOL VALUE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost like being there.","review":"This video is as close to really running the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon as you can get without getting wet.

The good: the player is compact and easy to use when it works. The bad (besides not working at all): the volume jumps from just barely audible to loud.

The 80s music only adds to the memories of my 80s childhood. This show had great potential to make even more episodes than it did.

This challenging workout will leave your arms feeling like wet noodles. It is led by Janet Brooks, who does kind of remind me of \\"Aerobics Instructor Barbie\\". That isn't really a bad thing, but you may end up hating her by the end of the workout because she will work you HARD. Not a single muscle group is neglected - she hits the back, chest, arms, shoulders, and even your core.Equipment used in this video: Fanny lifter (substitute: a step), sculpting stick (substitute: broomstick), and three sets of dumbbells.This is an excellent workout to sculpt your upper body. The only problem is that it is so tough I will have to really psych myself up to do it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best FIRM Workout - FIRM should do all like this one!","review":"Upper Body Sculpt is a very thorough workout and takes only 37 minutes (including warm-up and stretch). Janet's perfect timing moves this workout along quickly. She never misses a beat, not even in the set up, so you get a full and efficient workout.This workout really targets your entire Upper Body Muscles, unlike any other FIRM workout that attempts to be an Upper Body Workout. It is very effective, and you see results almost immediately. I love Janet's no-nonsense teaching style. She's for real, and it shows that she's there to give you a great workout, unlike most other FIRM instructors who can't cue well and are more interested in being cutesy than teaching a solid workout that gives results. Janet leads and cues so well that I want other FIRM videos just like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of My top 5 firm videos","review":"When I became serious about My workouts and used MY firm dvds I lost 24lbs.

It requires a sculpting stick, 2 different Fanny Lifters, and at least four sets of dumbbells. Who has all of these at home?

I use my The Step instead of the silly Fanny Lifter, and I use my dumbbells instead of the ridiculous Sculpting Stick, and I still got a wonderful toning workout. I like that it's a relatively short workout (afterward I did the Crunch Dance Party for 40 minutes for cardio), and I don't like the weirdo instructors/participants. The lead has disproportionately large breasts that distractingly defy gravity despite her not wearing a bra, and as in all my other Firm videos, some of the other master instructors (standing behind the lead in this video) are freakishly muscled--not my aim at all. But those are all superficial issues. A solid workout for beginners or a light day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Upper Body Workout Ever!","review":"Janet Brooks is by far the best instructor at the FIRM. This workout is phenomenal. The upper body moves are unique and she makes it a lot of fun. Her cues are very easy to follow, and she is very straightforward with her coaching. This workout includes a variety of shoulder exercises, pushups and other chest work, biceps, triceps, back (including lower back) - my entire upper body gets worked when I use this workout. I wish I could buy more videos led by Janet Brooks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bag","review":"I bought two of these, one for a co-worker and one for myself.

I want each song to be its own stand alone work. That's how it should be. The problem with the last two compilations created for Carpenters \\"The Singles\\" and \\"Yesterday Once More\\" is that they purposely blend the songs together. NO!The other issue seems to be original versions of songs v. remastered material. It's all wonderful to go back to the master tapes and rerecord the tracks to make them sound fresh. However, if you start futzing with the arrangements and \\"improving\\" them by adding instrumentation, or whatever audio tricks you have in mind, you're tampering with the stuff that people are buying the album to hear!Just based on other reviews, some of this is going on again. What do I do to get Carpenters' songs the way I want them?! Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's All About The Voice","review":"How can any one complain about this album. Sure, some of the songs are remixed and not as well done as the originals but...................this is Karen Carpenter!!! We can never hear her beautiful voice on anything \\"new\\" again. All Richard can do is remixes and try to make them different. I, for one, will buy anything Richard puts out because I want to hear her any way I can. She had the most glorius, beautiful, haunting voice ever. I miss her talent tremendously."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Guiltiest Of All Pleasures","review":"I can't stand it when haters rag on the Carpenters. Say what you will, but no one can deny the beauty and simplicity of Karen Carpenter's voice. This collection is a great representation of the many hits that the Carpenters churned out in the the 70's. You get the tracks that they're the most known for (\\"Superstar\\" *my fave*, \\"We've only Just Begun\\", \\"Close To You\\", etc.) the covers (\\"Rainbow Connection\\", \\"California Dreamin\\", \\"Ticket To Ride\\", etc.) and some of the lesser known tracks. I can't help but marvel at the innocense and simplicity that this music represesnts. So it had no substance....who really cares? Music nowadays lacks the innosence that the Carpenters portrayed and it's rather sad how the times have changed. I'd trade hip hop for the 70's any day."},{"rating":"1","title":"musak at its best","review":"I was very disappointed with the recording.

I've never owned a Carpenters album but grew up listening to them and Karen had absolutely one of the greatest voices ever in pop, so pure and unaffected.

All the hits are included as well as material I've never heard before eg. 'Make Believe It's Your First Time', 'I Need To Be In Love', etc. Each and every one of these 40 tunes are gems. This is not a set of cd's to be downloaded because you would miss out on the liner notes and history of each song as told by Richard Carpenter. He seems very proud of the artistry of him and his sister and so he should be. A must have set for Carpenter fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"easy music","review":"great soft and easy music. uplifting and pure.

It's a \\"just right\\" way to tell a story that would make any writer wonder where to begin. Amy Bartlett's recollection of her own 9/11 day was a good way to set the scene and to introduce herself and her pertinent thoughts. She provides a selection of personal stories gained from interviewing others, a fair sampling of the many many stories that this day caused. We will all remember \\"where we were when...\\" This is a good gift book - especially for a New Yorker to give to a non-New Yorker."},{"rating":"2","title":"You won't want to put it down!","review":"First off, I will divulge I am a very close family friend of Amy's.

This book lets you view this fateful day through her eyes. It is heart-wrenching to read the description of people's reactions. It is also very uplifting. I read it every anniversary of 9/11.

I didn't understand the motivations of the characters and the plot twists aren't set up well. Some stunning visuals, especially that sequence across the rooftops. To me, the worst Park Chan-wook movie to date."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Buying","review":"Was intrigued to watch this movie because I like the director for the movies he has visioned in the past, (Three Extremes, Oldboy) which I really enjoyed. But this 'piece of work' so to say is very slow and strange. Not very entertaining and dialog is just cretinous. It doesn't really portray the same exact attributes that your average vampire movie would have and maybe that's why I didn't find it to be amusing. If you feel the need to see this, just rent it. Don't Purchase, you'll be dissatisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thirst","review":"I bought this movie expecting an erotic asian thriller. Instead it was a PG rated movie.

That's the key to it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great vampire story full of depressing reality.","review":"First of all, Korean women are the most beautiful women in the world! I am hopelessly in love with the leading female star, Ok-bin Kim. Miss Kim does a great job playing a sexually obsessive woman. Also, Kang ho Song is a great actor and does a great job at showing how men fall from grace. Sex is currently one of the most abused natural urges of Mankind. This film goes to great lenghts at showing how sex makes us who and what we are in essence. Esoterically, according to this film, no matter how much change a Man or Woman may undergo in life they cannot escape their origin which is linked to the sex act. Not even vampires!!! Hahahah. Highly recommended for people who enjoy Korean cinema."},{"rating":"2","title":"Korean vampires","review":"Some weird, crazy asian narrative, but still far more interesting vampire than the ones that shine with daylight.

Although it's arguable in which is the worst, watch it yourself to see. Watching the first few minutes I thought \\"ok, this isn't too terribly bad,\\" but then it took a dive for the worst: Viz left the original Japanese voice actor's singing in for Mitsuki! The sad thing is, the American voice and Japanese voice don't even sound alike so I was like \\"she's singing?!.\\" I have seen a lot of things. What you're paying for in this DVD is basically the English dub. The English version takes so many liberties on the characters' pasts that it's not even funny. I could almost swear that Viz ripped the script straight from a FanSub and changed a few lines to Americanize it."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG","review":"This was horrible to watch because the english dub sucked so bad.

I think my pet rock does better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bruce does the sweaty-vested hero thing again...","review":"Director John McTiernan returned to helm the 3rd part to the Die Hard trilogy, which regains much of the fun action that was missing in Renny Harlin's Die Hard 2. Bruce Willis does the sweaty-vested action hero thing again as John McClane, and to good effect. The main villain, played by Jeremy Irons, is much better than the weak bad guys in DH2, and the inclusion of Samuel L. Jackson makes it even better. Great stunts, action, one-liners, explosions and music. Fine extras too, with a featurette and trailers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Non-stop action, humor, and great acting","review":"Usually I am not too entertained by movies like this, as they all have the same plot. But this one does it with style. Not only is there heart pounding action through the entire movie, but there are many funny scenes added throughout. Although parts of the movie are quite cheesy, that's to be expected from a movie of this genre. Hats off to the actors; Bruce Willis does a good job and Samuel L. Jackson is incredible."},{"rating":"2","title":"As i was goin to St. Ives I met a Man with Seven Wives","review":"The best movie of the series. Period. It has more action, more scenery, better characters, better acting. This is the ultimate edition. Samuel L. Jackson. Beautiful Performance as a somewhat racist store owner who becomes an unlikely partner after saving John McClane in the first ten minutes of the movie. From there it is non stop action. No meaningless stretches where they jsut talk and ramble about nothing. Simon is the villain who has caught some feelings over his brother's death. ( Nakatomi) and does an excellent job as the villain. The only gripe is that simon went out like a punk. I think they coudve ended it better but it still leaves you satisfied. YOU should definitely buy this. Also check out the first two because they are no slouch either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old formula","review":"Same old formula. . .Yes, it's full of action and stunts, but once you have seen one, it's easy to get tired of:o Bruce Willis making faces and cursing in phony frustrationo blurred images to generate phony excitemento lights that shine directly into the camerao Willis armed with a pistol and a handful of cartridges confronting a whole shipful of heavily armed terrorists"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of My Favorites","review":"This is one of my favorite movies.

Thisspecial edition has good picture and sound plusneat extras. I highly recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't die hard","review":"A little bit sillier than the previous two, but still entertaining and worth watching for some popcorn entertainment. Samuel L. Jackson is awesome as the co-star, but my main problem with the movie is that it lacks some of the hard-hitting action that made the first two elite. Granted, this one has some great moments too, it just is not as good as the first two. It is still pretty good though and a worthy installmant to the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Your Average Run of the Mill Suspense Film","review":"I have followed the life and times of John McClane from the beggining, and have always loved Bruce Willis' abilities to make this character come to life and seem so real. For this reason I wasn't happy to find that he and hife \\"wife\\" had divorced sometime between the last movie and this one, but that aspect alone makes the ending of this film worth waiting for. I also liked the very original escape scene in the film as McClane runs for his life through water filled tunnels. This is one film you shouldn't miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST DVD TRANSFER OF A FILM!","review":"Don't get me wrong, the 1 star is for the DVD. I give the movie 5 stars. The reason for the one star is that THX was supposed to have remastered this movie, it looks like they took the movie overlooked it and said it looks fine to us. DON'T BUY THE ORIGINAL!

And One Other Thing I Should Mention.","review":"If you are looking for a movie that is filled with hard hitting action, Die Hard is it. It has so much action packed into the movie from beginning to end. In my opinion, it's probably the greatest action film in all of history.Oh, and by the way, to whoever wrote the product descripion for the first Die Hard movie, the character Hans Gruber is played by Alan Rickman. Not by Alexander Godunov as you described. Godunov plays Gruber's sidekick, Karl. I just wanted to let you know that for two reasons. Firstly, so people who haven't seen Die Hard can read your description and get the correct information about the characters they're going to see, and secondly, because Alan Rickman is my favorite actor and I think he deserves credit where credit is due. So whoever wrote that description would please be kind and edit the names. Thank you very much"},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"Bruce Willis is witty and serious, saving the day.

The theater was right across from the plant and I met my buddy, Danny, who got free promo tickets for opening night or my buddy Dave won them but could not show. I can not remember, but I think it is the latter. It was exciting going to a premier showing; they had draws, local celebrities, save the Jets campaign, etc. The movie was ok. Another typical action movie, but I like the water Jug part. I hope many of you can guess the mystery, my mathematically inclined friend did, and myself a little after the movie. Bruce Willis does not do the over the top annoying borderline jerk character, and I like the more realistic role."},{"rating":"2","title":"Die hard son!","review":"I'm a die hard fan.

What else is one to remark of a movie in which people are manifestly killed for the pleasure of the audience watching it? It is a sign of our profoundly debased and witless times that the same rating of 3.5 stars should have been given by a pundit to this brutal, vainglorious, and puerile film as he had elsewhere deigned to give to a very different film, \\"Dr. Ehrlich's Magic Bullet\\" (1940; director William Dieterle; starring Edward G.

This is a collection of articles by different authors from Woodenboat magazine regarding ... planking and fastening. It's not really a fun book like some boat design books but more of a manual on how to complete a boat.

The author apparently feels it's more important to impress the reader with how much he knows and all the fancy words that a \\"real\\" professional would use rather than write an easy to follow how-to book that most novices can follow. This is not to say that this is the only marine how-to author who is guilty of this. However, this guy pushes it way over board (no pun intended). After spending 15 minutes with this book, I had to pack it up and send it back to whence it came. Even the pictures were difficult to follow. Sorry, Pete. Maybe I'll come across one of your other books that I can understand a little more easily.

And I never do that. Usually I practice more self-control. If you're like me and find 80% of the literature pumped out these days unreadable and flat than this book will be like Christmas dinner. I have'nt read anything this good in years. One of those books that you just want to spill all over your close freinds and workmates.And Jimmy Lerner saves the best for last.Part three about his life before prison in AA meetings and his subsequent fall outshines most of the prison stories, and believe me when you're reading the first two parts you won't see how that could be possible.

This is a poorly written and disorganized book. The descriptions of characters behind the walls are one dimensional and self-serving. The attempts at relating corporate skills to prison survival skills are shallow at best. The story of the crime the author committed to get to prison does not ring true on any level. This story sounds like a thousand others, only perhaps this guy is a bit more literate and knows an agent. A larger than average vocabulary does not make you a writer any more than it makes you a pro-social member of the community."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"This book was first brought to my attention by my husband who also enjoyed it.

I hope this author soon publishes another excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Prison Story","review":"From start to finish I couldn't put this down.I read it years ago and have thought about some of the scenes in this book ever since. Re-read it again recently and it's just as good as the first time.My original paperback copy has been passed along from friend to friend over the years and when we get together all of us still talk about this crazy story. It makes you think ... how an ordinary person (like you) could easily end up in prison with just a few wrong choices.Well written, engrossing and entirely frighteningly enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping story","review":"Reading the various other reviews on this I have to agree with many of them. The first part of this book is gripping and really gives you a sense of what it must be like to 'wake up in hell'. How true it is I do not know but from other accounts of the US system it seems plausible. However I agree with the reviewer who says he found the last section of how he came to be in prison self serving and I too thought going to Vegas with a certified nutjob would lead to no good! However give it a read-you'll enjoy it. I too emailed the author and await his next book (if it ever appears) eagerly"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Always Thought Prison Inmates Worked At The Phone Company!","review":"It is fascinating how the author shows how he used his New Age, California, touchy-feely, Management training he received at the Phone Company and applied it to prison situations. It is hilarious when he relates how the \\"skills necessary for survival at The Phone Company\\" can be applied to the convict gang leaders in this Nevada prison.Who knew that being a corporate cubicle nerd like the author was a great preparation for being in a cellblock with murderers, rapists, drug dealers and pedophiles.This book is an incredible, wonderful, funny, bittersweet journey that I am still talking about to all my friends a week after I read it. I hope the Hollywood guys stay true to the book when they do the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than a prison story - much more!","review":"I originally borrowed this book from my friend thinking it was a memoir, a true story of a corporate executive sentenced to 12 years in prison.I quickly discovered the writer is far more ambitious and talented!

Gets Mocked!","review":"This is a really great read and the author does an amazing job of telling a very difficult story. The story of one average man's fall into the hellish abyss of the American prison system is a tragic story. Yet the author keeps us laughing with his light touch and sardonic tone.Where the book disappoints is in the descriptions of the Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. All 12-Step meetings has eccentric characters yet the author would have us believe that A.A. is full of cross-addicted addicts, overeaters and sexually dysfunctional degenerates.When the author sticks with his experiences as a \\"cubicle slave\\" for The Phone Company or as the \\"Lawdawg\\" in prison, the book is simply wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lerner outsmarts self","review":"A good disappointing book. Not to be a lemming, but I agree with other critics in that the last chapter on the corporate life should have been left out. The story of the crime itself is pure fantasy. Alcoholic Rambo overpowers crack addled strongman?! Puh-leeze! Then we see the NYTBR investigation that discovers the 'monster' is a little guy! The jacket says \\"every word is true\\" -- so how much else is false? The rendering of the prison vernacular is quite good as is the depiction of the economic system. I find it hard to believe, though, that Mr. Lerner was never once attacked or abused in prison - he just rarely mentions a tear here and a bit of fear there. Could have been alot better. Like so many cons the book sinks itself. In spite of all this I found the story interesting and worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harrowing, True, Laugh Out Loud Funny","review":"I came to this page because I wanted to see if Jimmy Lerner has written a second book. If he had, I'd snatch it up in a heartbeat. You Got Nothing Coming is a wonderful book, hilarious, hair-raising, true. There were passages that had me laughing uncontrollably, others that were terrifying -- not just as a figure of speech, but terrifying for real. Jimmy Lerner can flat-out write. I just hope he's got another book in him -- or three."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"This would be a good book if I were 45 and I wanted an explanation of my kid's slang.

The article goes on to describe the incident in Mr. Lerner's statements given to the police immediately after the incident--which is a far cry from the description given in the book.

And there are many inconsistencies throughout. I can see why the editor decided to leave the story of the murder to the end of the book--the author becomes unsympathetic and the story of his supposed mistreatment and misunderstanding under the law unravels.

This is not only the best so far, but my best read of the year.Here is a writer who can squeeze the wet towel of irony and come up with wine. He is a master of the repeating joke. After reading this book, your vocabulary will be changed forever.Here's how much I liked the book: immediately after reading it, I had to buy two copies for my brother and sister (I want to reread my own) so that we can all read it and use it as a reference for new family \\"in-jokes.\\" This book: it's all good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging, but some things don't ring true..","review":"Just finished the book. I couldn't put it down either, but when I got to the last section of the book things weren't ringing true for me. Lerner tells about his two back surgeries and constant back pain. I know people who have had that same surgery, the symptoms don't just \\"go away\\". I would think that physical problem would have impacted his life in prison. He never mentions it though. Then he tells how he spends his workdays playing games on the computer and deleting e-mail requests, but a little later goes on to tell how he is a workaholic and dedicated cubicle slave. And why in the world would he knowingly move onto the same street where \\"the Monster\\" lives? That doesn't make sense.I started wondering if any of the book was true. The image of Lerner I had from reading the first prison section of the book totally changed after reading the last part. The book certainly keeps your interest though and makes you want to stay out of jail!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book except for all the corporate stuff!","review":"I loved this book when the author was describing his cellmate, Kansas, or when he mocks the Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.

I deliberated about buying this album for quite awhile. It seemed like everything I was hearing by John Reis sounded essentially the same, and there didn't seem to be any point in acquiring more of his stuff, no matter how well he did it. But it was a good investment. Back Off Cupids is some of the loudest Reis music I've heard, but it's not the hard-charging masculine rock I was used to. It's pretty hard to compare to his other projects, even though all the trademark elements are there. You definitely have to hear it to understand. Then again, maybe you won't. Back Off Cupids is complicated. But it's more worthwhile than most of the Reis encounters I've had.

He's lucky he's so small and it didn't choke him as he struggled to get it off his neck. Beware leaving your pup alone with this toy as it can get stuck around a little pup's neck. Maybe this is fine for big dogs, but NOT for small dogs - I have a Maltese. I'd ONLY buy this for big dogs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pup didn't find it interesting","review":"Bought this for a teething 8-week-old border collie puppy. She really likes things that make a \\"crinkle\\" noise, so I figured this would be fun for her. She played with it for about 30 seconds, put it down, and never looked at it again. And this is a puppy that will bite and chew ANYTHING she sees. I tried to play tug-of-war with her with this, and she was very disinterested with it.The \\"crinkly\\" noise is very slight & soft--definitely nothing loud enough to keep a high-energy dog like a border collie engaged.Might be fun for extremely young pups (maybe 3-5 weeks?), or very sensitive/easily-scared dogs, but if you have a pup that really likes gnawing on stuff and making a lot of noise, look elsewhere :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly fun puppy toy!","review":"We got this toy for our Lab pup when he was about 10 weeks old and it's still in great shape even though he's now an aggressive chewer at 4 months. He has dismembered aKONG BraidZ Large Tigerbut hasn't torn this toy at all despite heavy play.He loves playing fetch with this toy, and the way some of the tabs that line the outside make a crinkly crunchy sound when he chews them is really satisfying to him. The fact that it's soft means I don't have to worry if my kids want to toss it inside the house. They like to not only throw it for him, but skim it across our tiled kitchen floor.

Pacios's attempt to accuse Orson Welles as the killer by backing up her diagnosis of his \\"secretive\\" sociopathy through an examination of Welles's movie props,off-screen behaviour and sudden trip to Europe following the murder cannot be justified in any way. I do hope she has a good lawyer in case the people handling Mr. Welles's estate ever sue her for slander and libel.For you Dahlia die-hards, John Gilmore's Severed is where you want your money.

So, we mounted 2 of these wall mounted units on a small sliver of wall next to the rods. They are easy to install. The plastic hangars for the ties are a heavier duty plastic and free of sharp edges that often come with cheaper moulded plastic. My only complaint is that the opposing clips that the ties slide into are a little awkward to separate. I wish they were rounded instead of flat. Also, since my husband has a lot of ties and the unit only comes with 30 hangars, it would be nice if the unit either came in 2 sizes with the second size being longer to accomodate more hangars or if we could purchase a bag of extra hangars for a nominal price.

But the beauty, power and expressiveness of his voice is unmatched by any tenor I have ever heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"BMG Needs to hire Folks in the Know","review":"There are several cuts on this CD that Lnaza did in fact record much better at other times. I have all his records LPs, 78s and movies and I wish BMG would consult a Lanza fan,or me,for the cuts would make the perfect CD. I think its great that we have such a wonderful collection of recordings of Lanza and this one warts and all is still one of the best. The best Lanza set was the RCA LP 2 record set put out in the 70s with Lanza on the cover in M. Butterfly. Where oh where can it be??? Long live Mario Lanza!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Typically good recording by Unicorn","review":"A friend of mine commented that a male soprano is an acquired taste. The countertenor on this disc sings with a lot of conviction, and the alternation with the rich baritone make it very listenable. The instrumental improvisations get a little wild -- typical for this ensemble -- but they never sound completely improbable. These versions of Cantigas 18 and 295 in particular are possibly the best out there, and definitely the most fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice board","review":"For the price, this is a very nice board.

The problem isn't with the DVD burner, because other brands have offered me nearly flawless service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok on PC, not very good with DVD recorder","review":"I had been buying Memorex DVD+R media, but thought I'd try the HP because the 50 pack was priced 25% less than the Memorex brand, and HP is not exactly a no-name brand. I found that the HP media works ok on my PC's (HP) dvd burner ok, but I really wanted to use these on my dvd video recorder. I tried to record 4 movies off-the-air. 2 of them worked ok, the other 2 errored and resulted in a 'coaster'. At that point, I figured the media was not quite good enough for that device (it's a Cyberhome CH-DVR 1500).Based on this, and not wanting to waste any more media, I'm going back to Memorex brand for the video recorder. I think the extra few $ for that brand is money well spent and don't think I'll be buying anymore HP media."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it!!!!!!

I like it because it's not overly complicated at all and the chips really fly as opposed to clogging up in the chute. The fence is substantial, easy to adjust / lock and it's very straight forward to use. I don't want to have to \\"refresh my memory\\" for its use on those few occasions when I need biscuits. If for some reason I needed another, I wouldn't hesitate to buy another Makita for this tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just a biscuit joiner","review":"I have been very satisfied with this biscuit joiner. It operates smoothly, the dust bag works fine, no parallax problems and its easy to handle (I'm glad to have spent the extra $ for it).Its other benefit is that I bought a 110mm(=4&3/8inch) blade so I can use the joiner as a panel cutoff saw. The max depth of cut I can get is 1 inch and the high quality head machining means the cuts are straight and square. I cut my panels up with this blade and then quickly swop back to the biscuit cutter blade to do the joints. This is great for a woodworker like me who has no room for a table saw.Update 2012: just found that I can set the adjustable fence so it references the outside of boards with mitre edge joints and not the inside. Very good when the boards are of slightly different thicknesses."},{"rating":"2","title":"I just love biscuits!","review":"This plate joiner works great! It's movement is extremely smooth and the cuts are accurate. I've made many joints with this tool and it's a pleasure to use every time. The depth stop is easy to use and consistant, just dial to the correct biscuit size. I love how it holds on to the wood, no slipping, even on miters/bevels. It's very easy to use and you may find yourself using it for more than just biscuits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Happy","review":"As a first time biscuit joiner I studied the Amazon reviews and decided on this one. I am not disappointed! I've only done edge joining but I'm totally happy with my project thus far, I would purchase this item again if necessary. The chip bag needs to be aimed down to the floor and plan on emptying it after 7 cuts using .20 setting otherwise the collection area behind the fence jams up with shavings and is difficult to clear. This unit seems very safe as I have used it. I've only used the unit with pine wood so far. I don't feel like there's much chance I could get injured from this tool. I hold the unit by the barrel to plunge and hold the top left corner down with my finger (right handed) to assure level cut into the face of the joint edge. Very happy with this purchase and the packaging is of course Amazon quality...great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"sloppy tolerances","review":"I am surprised by all the positive reviews of this product. The adjustment stop on mine is slightly out of alignment causing the stop bolt to bind with the adjustment mechanism. Instead of returning for a new unit, I disassembled the stop adjustment knob and filed it down a bit so that the bolt would not rub against the knob. My major complaint is with the rack and pinion adjusting fence which is not parallel. The pinion gear is only on one side of the fence and there is over 1/8 inch play from side to side. I will need to check the fence after every adjustment. Fortunately as a hobbiest, I don't have to deal with setting the tool up all day long. I am considering returning it for the Dewalt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great deal. Works good.","review":"I've had and used this for a few months now. So far so good. I have never used other plate joiners so I can't compare it too well but at least using this one I'm able to get good joints with even my novice abilities. As with any tool you have to pay attention to detail to get things right but at least I feel confident that this tool is of sufficient quality that I can produce high quality joints without undue effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"satisfied amazon customer","review":"This was the sixth installation of planet waves auto trim tuners we've performed for the same customer over the past few years.

This album gives a new listener the feel and sound of what Gospel Music was like in the 40's and 50's. Higher pitched voices with minimal instrumentation. The sound can be grating if you are not used to it. However, as an example of Gospel Music, you would be hard pressed to find better. The songs covered are from that period and many have been lost through the years and have not been recorded. It is a good album and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not All Original But Good","review":"This album will have you wanting to go back to that time in your life when everything was simple.Basement parties with the black light.With the acception of \\"You and I\\" which is not the original,but still enjoyable to listen to, this is a good album to take you back down memory lane and have you wanting more.A blend of harmonies and melodies that you won't hear in todays music.Enjoy the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fishing guide","review":"I have Mr. Steinstra's camping book and this is done in a similar vein.

We have contacted Amazon several times and have had them decline a return. After 2 months, we are still wiating for her to eat and fall asleep. VERY DISAPPOINTING! Would not recommend at all!!!

We haven't had an problems with her eating her food and you just need to slightly squeeze the bottle. We bought Pampers preemie diapers and they fit great and are much cheaper. Baby alive also fits into preemie clothes perfectly. I do have a few complaints though...the first time I wiped off her face the paint on her lips came off, her hair looks terrible unless you are far away b/c it is so thin, and she needs some more phrases to say (no she's not in trial mode).

The Left killed 35,000 priests and religious workers.

You can see him take a little solo in the \\"Fela in Concert\\" video, filmed in Paris in 1981. He, better than any other, is well grounded in the Afrobeat tradition. But beginning with Shoki Shoki, he brings this great music into today's musical scene, keeping the rhythms that make this music and adding a completely contemporary sound. This CD is very hot, full of great dance numbers and politically aware lyrics that come across as much more heartfelt and bitter than his dad's. Fela suffered more than Femi, was burnt out of his house and imprisoned by the government, but he always maintained a sarcastic sense of humor. Femi is more urgent, and so is more thought provoking. This fire drives the music, infuses it with feeling and meaning and makes your heart beat stronger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Banging!","review":"This album not only has political views in it, carrying on his father's tradition, but the song Beng, Beng, Beng is really banging!!!!!!!!!!

She is one of my favorite actresses. I had never seen this film before, and I have to admit I found it slow and somewhat dull. The storyline is set in occupied Paris, and one would think that this would put some excitement and suspense into the film, but it just meanders along. The characters that Charles Boyer and Bergman portray are somewhat annoying, and despite the talents of the two stars, it's hard to feel much sympathy for their plight. Bergman looks fantastic--she may never have looked better than in this film--but it's too bad the screenplay does not match her beauty. Hard-core Ingrid Bergman fans may still be interested in picking up this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arch of Triumph, gloom and doom","review":"Arch of Triumph is film noir at its worst. Badly filmed, written and acted. A study in how to produce a bad film. Charles Boyer, Charles Laughton and Ingrid Bergman couldn't save thid turkey.

It's a tragedy that dear Ingrid and Charles had to work with such material... It actually wasn't a bad story - it just needed a lot of help.

The only reason I would buy it would be to say, yes I have it. It does have Ingrid after all. But whether I would ever unwrap it and view it is another story.There were a few good moments. Unfortunately they got so mixed up in the rainy haze that I can't remember what they were. This is definitely only for people who are Ingrid freaks like me and even I wasn't moved by it.Well, so much for that.

I could hardly stay awake during the first hour. Bergman and Boyer do what they can with shoddy material but their characters are somewhat unlikeable, especially Bergman's.

Its more like a 4.9. Still I think Jeremy Camps' first cd is much better. Because this cd is a worship album the songs are much slower especially in comparison to his debut album. Still I do recomend it for those who love listening to worship songs with a more rock out beat to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A prophet of the modern revolution.","review":"There is no denying that Jeremy Camp smashed his way through with \\"Stay\\" and his amazing story of how the songs came about for that Album.I found the album musically to be a great encouragement and one that provides and alternative to the rich sounds of mainstream CBA worship albums...this is real!IN this, HIS second mainstream release you will hear a man searching God's heart within the context of his pain. Looking for direction and all the time Giving God Praise for the gratitude and relationship that Jeremy passionatly has with the Lord Jesus.I found this album to be an awesome follow up to \\"Stay\\" and a great addition to the Trilogy in his Journey which comes to a close in \\"Restored\\" his new release. Its almost like reading a story when you read the lyrics and know the journey he has been on.A prophet .. of the modern revolution.YOU will dig this.GS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worship-filled, yet exciting","review":"I got this CD as a gift and It's been such a blessing, Jeremy Camp's style to his music and strength of his voice are so catchy.But his love for God is so strong that I see all of his songs as worship music.

This exam has absolutely no sensitivity or specificity since 97% of people pass it.

I honestly didn't buy this book, but took a look at it in my medical school's bookstore and had to laugh. Preparation for the exam is basically doing your rotations, remembering how you spoke to them and examined them, and then speaking English (which is 1/3 of the exam).

Best Out Of Eden to date!!","review":"There are so many great songs on Love, Peace and Hapiness its hard to choose the best from the best. Out Of Eden really elevated the standard with this cd. It is full of great songs, lyrics and style. If you like any of Out Of Eden's previous offerings then you'll love this one. Their style, although it has evolved, is familar and that is just fine because its just building on greatness.I really enjoy every song (except for Tenessee Girls, it was just bad...GRITS didn't bring their magic to this interlude, at all!). Songs such as Love, Peace and Happiness, I Know, Shoulda' Listened, Could've Been Me and Secret are all great. The best song on the cd that impacted me the mose is Sincerely. The song vocalises what we should all feel, a sense of gratitude because we are unworthy of all that Jesus Christ did for us. It as a very touching song and I love it.Please make plans to buy this cd it is worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Perspectives, New Insights in to the Old, Old Story","review":"At first glance, and through much of the first third or so of the book, it appears as if this is a book for the learned and scholarly, much too \\"academic\\" for the casual reader seeking a new perspective or new insights....then, as Thursday approaches, the book \\"takes off,\\" telling once again, the \\" Old, Old Story\\" with new insight and different perspectives, all of them reverent and respectful---respectful of those who want to take the Bible literally, but also respectful---and reassuring and challenging--to those who want to see and beleive the Bible in a different manner.

Good addition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"The search for \\"the historical Jesus\\" and the assumptions made around that whole conversation are paramount in this work.

Our church book study group is very pleased with it. Based on the Gospel of Mark, it goes step by step and day by day with helpful information on the history and culture of First Century Jerusalem and it's Roman Rulers.

I approach the Bible as a Unitarian Universalist and appreciate the wealth of context they provide. I find this book helpful and enriching."},{"rating":"2","title":"fascinating and unsentimental","review":"Written by two scholars, this is not the usual academic book loaded with footnotes, but rather something rare: \\"a page turner\\"! The dull, \\"I've heard all this before... yawn\\" has been set aside, and in its place the authors unfold a series of new insights, closely tied to the cultural context of the Roman Empire, and Jewish ideas of Jesus' day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jesus and Rome in a nutshell","review":"The Last Week gives the story of Jesus in His last week leading to the cross as described in Mark, the oldest gospel. It clearly shows how much of a revolutionary figure Jesus was and why he was such a threat to local Roman authority that they felt the need to execute him. It shows that no one can really understand the New Testament without a good working knowledge of Roman history. If this book were required Sunday School material in our Christian churches, we would have a lot less antisemitism and conflict within our ranks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Provacative conclusions about Jesus' week","review":"This book gives some interesting thoughts about Jesus' entry into Jerusalem and his activity during the last week of his life. The discussion of how Crossan and Borg see the activities, with their comments and OT references, bring some different consideratons to mind. the discussion of what \\"sacrifice\\" means and how it \\"makes sacred\\" is very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly deep","review":"These guys are enormously talented musicians. Even so, I figured their Christmas album would probably be a little cheesy, if only because Christmas itself has become a little cheesy these days. However this album is anything but cheesy--on the contrary, the songs have clearly been chosen with extreme care and fine taste. There are hymns, old cowboy songs, folk songs, each precisely arranged and performed by the exceedingly capable Riders. This album is sure to delight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun way to enjoy your old favorites as well as new","review":"As a recent transplant to Texas, this seemed like a natural new Christmas CD choice and it didn't disappoint. It includes traditional songs as well as cowboy songs I didn't know but do enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas the Cowboy Way","review":"\\"Riders in the Sky\\" are always great. Once again sound quality is superb. Songs such as \\"The Christmas Yodel\\", Side Meat's Christmas Stew\\", and \\"The Prairie Dogs Christmas Ball\\" are ones I had never heard...and I have been around going on 74 years! \\"The Twelve Days of Christmas\\" contain different lyrics than what we are traditionally familiar with, having been adapted to \\"Side Meats\\" humorous manner of thinking and speaking. This latter song contains some worthwhile yodeling and is worth the price of the entire album."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a fun Christmas album","review":"I must admit that I love the Riders in the Sky anyway so this review is probably slanted that way.

However, it has a clear bias, presenting and defending a right-wing agenda. For example:*Taxes, unions, environmental protection, transfer payments are bad.*School vouchers, social security reform to presonal retirement accounts, medical savings accounts are good ideas.Of course I oversimplify (slightly), but whatever side of these and other issues one might fall, it's pretty clear that the other side is given short shrift.A minor beef I had with this text is that too many of its examples cater to the college student."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teaches basic economics","review":"If you have time and want to learn macro and micro economics fundamentals and how it can applied in a practical setting, then is the book for you.

This is not another \\"Hard Days Night\\" filled with goofy hijinx as you might expect from a band like Slade in 1974, but rather a semi-autobiographical look at the ups and downs of becoming pop superstars. And while there are no master thespians in the group they certainly don't embarass themselves portraying the \\"fictional\\" group FLAME. Definitely a classic of the era.Also included is a 50+ minute interview with Slade frontman Noddy Holder conducted in 2002. This DVD is a must have for all Slade fans! However this disc loses one star for the transfer. The credits at the beginning and end are in 2.35:1 aspect but the rest of the film is 1.85:1. You will notice some people being partially chopped out of shots because of this. Why couldn't they have just done the whole film in its proper aspect??? At least it's anamorphic.Cheers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good film, crappy DVD","review":"This is a very good rock film, featuring a band who sadly had little success in America, even though they were immensely popular in the U.K. and Europe.Unfortunately, Sony did a really poor job with this DVD. The print they used is generally in good condition. However, the film was shot in Panavision (2.35:1 aspect ratio), but on the DVD only the credits are the full widescreen. The rest of the film is only slightly letterboxed, so that characters are routinely cut off the sides and the whole film has an \\"off-kilter\\" feel to it.On top that, Sony (in it's apparent never-ending desire to keep those dreaded black bars as small as possible) has made the height of the image slightly too tall, so that every edit (cut) in the film appears as a quick white line at the top of the picture. It's VERY distracting in the many dark scenes in the movie.Don't the people at Sony who do the work on these DVD releases have ANY quality control or take ANY pride in their product?"},{"rating":"1","title":"If it's worth doing, it's worth doing well.","review":"Sadly, the company producing this DVD put no effort into making this film worth watching. The beginning and end credits are \\"widescreen\\" and still cut off the edges. The rest of the film is full frame, showing you less than 1/2 of the picture. Absoluitely dreadful. On the plus side, the special features include a nice long interview with Noddy Holder on the making of the film, and THAT is the only reason to make this purchase. Here's hoping the film with be re-released by a more quality conscious company in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-see rock film!","review":"I did notice the change in aspect ratio after the title sequence, but I didn't find it that distracting. The picture quality itself is fine, and the film is about as good as a rock film can get. It reminds me sort of like a rock version of The Harder They Come--untrained actors, location scenes rather than studio sets, dialogue you have to listen closely to to understand. And most of all, they are both unvarnished looks at the seamy side of fame and the entertainment business. Slade doesn't resort to crime, but plenty of shady activity surrounds them as the reach the toppermost of the poppermost, only to find it isn't exactly what they want out of life. In the midst of the pre-punk glam seventies, this demystification of the rock world must have been a real slap in the face for audiences. It remains a bracingly enjoyable film today. Don't miss it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmmm","review":"I've only watched this film once and I don't have any Slade in my collection but based on the \\"Hard Days Night\\" reference in the original review I expected a higher quality film. The pacing in this film is pretty bad. The video is dark in many spots and the audio is horrible. It's interesting to watch but I think you had to be there the first time to understand the \\"greatness\\" of this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I just bought this and cannot say how disappointed I am. I read almost all the reviews and still never came away with the information that there are virtually no performances by Slade on this.

Does no live Slade exist on film?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow Content, Many Errors, Poor Examples","review":"I almost always turn to O'Reilly first when purchasing a new reference book, however this time I was disappointed. This book is fairly shallow in content and much of the information that you need is actually buried in the text instead of being presented as a topic unto itself.The thing that is the most bothersome, however, is the plethora of flat out errors. Many of the examples have typos, missing code, etc. Even as a PHP novice I was constantly spotting errors which is frustrating when you're trying to learn the language.On top of that, many of the examples exhibit just plain bad programming form (inefficient code, variables that are only used once, etc). It's the kind of thing that makes a seasoned programmer wince (and if I was reviewing the code I would send it back to the author with lots of red ink)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"Programming PHP is a great introduction to PHP. The chapters are well written with good examples that explain what is being discussed. The chapters are not written in a \\"read one after the other\\" fashion, so you can easily go to the chapter you need information on and find what you are looking for. This book did have some errors in the sample code, but if you read the text and actually try out the examples you can easily figure out what needs to be fixed to get them running. Since the O'Reilly \\"Programming\\" series is more about advanced programming issues, I think this book should have had the title \\"Learning PHP\\". It just seems to be an introduction, because it did not delve into any advanced topics. It is worthy to have on any PHP developers bookshelf.

Besides fact-checking everything that the other authors wrote, he contributed many chapters of his own.

Every example is coming out of nowhere. It doesn't have a project. So everytime different variables, situations. Like, in one example it uses Flintstones character names ($name=Fred, $name2 = fred etc.). Next example is subjects of a class (math, science, history, english etc.), on other one it uses very random strings like (\\"I like paris in november\\", \\"the key is in my pants\\")If you want to learn PHP, stick with \\"PHP and MySQL Web Development, Second Edition\\" By Luke Welling, Laura Thompson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"O Reilly publishes the best programming books--they're accurate, elegant and get to the point quickly. Unfortunately, this book is an exception. I agree with the complaints of the other reviewers, e.g., the text has buried information and incorrect examples. However, my main ojection is the index. It appears that the authors simply searched for every keyword in the book then tabulated them in the index. Thus, the index is hardly useful. It's no good to look through several pages just to find that the keyword was used once in a passing sentence that has little to do with that topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Book for Beginners!","review":"This book is really hard to understand for beginners.

The title implies that the book would cover PHP in the same manner that Programming Perl (from the same publisher) covers Perl, but this is not true.

They are most likly attemping to script php5 code examples in a PHP4 setting and not realizing it. Yes, some of the examples do not realte which also happens in a few other books, but the point of this book is to pass a message on HOW to script. The examples should not need to relate in any specific manner. If you need a book that uses the same examples over and over again to get the point through, i reccomend \\"PHP: A visual quickstart guide\\" or just not attemping PHP at all and sticking to HTML. And if you do not know HTML, dont even attempt this scripting language becuase you will never be able to figure out PHP."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book is 'OK', but not great","review":"I used this book at work, and wasn't impressed.Now, maybe it's the language itself that lacks consistency and isn't all that interesting, I don't know.I wasn't as much exceited reading the book as I was when I read, for example, K&R; (C), Paul Graham and Peter Seibel (Lisp), Meyers (C++).

However, many times his arguments are lost in his use of analogies, references, and words which even an attorney can not understand. In other parts of his book, he provides little explanation of the economic theories which have been used by previous scholars to defend the current status of information law. This leaves the reader confused unless the reader is an economist by training. Although I agree with Boyle's view of information law as being bigger than it has previously been defined, I think his archaic style of writing leaves the reader more frustrated than enlightened. I recommend having Black's Law Dictionary and Webster's handy if you are going to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant analysis of law, information and the market.","review":"I have both just finished Boyle's book and his Torts class at Washington College of Law. Boyle's analysis is strikingly clear. Taking as one of his launching-off points the important California Supreme Court decision in Moore V. Regents of California, Boyle tackles issues ranging from the commodification and distribution of information to the creation of legally protected property interests in biology. He exposes that courts make decisions based not so much on ahistorical, immutable legal principles but on policy considerations often directly related to contemporary trends in economic thinking. Boyle, despite several references to Marx, is a defender of a uniquely American kind of privatized safety regime in the form of the tort system. This has confused careless readers as evidenced by Huber in the pages of the NYT."},{"rating":"1","title":"An interesting analysis gone horribly wrong.","review":"The first half of this book offers interesting analysis of the legal problems with valuing intellectual property.

Yes Sublime is a very talented band with a good sense of music but what happened with this album? I'm looking at the inside cover and it says that all drums were PROGRAMED by Brad. WHAT, programed, the drums aren't real. How could a band with so much talent use a drum kit to make there album. Another thing is the songs sound [awful] because they were recorded in some dude's basement. I give it 2 stars because there are 4 or 5 good tracks. But if you want a real good CD with about 17 great tracks skip this and get 40. oz to Freedom or the self titled CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD blows","review":"I want to first start off by saying that I am a HUGE Sublime fan. This was the last of their three original CD's that I bought, and I was very disappointed in it. It has maybe 3 good songs on it.

This statement might rise question to why I gave it 5 stars. I did so because sublime is not just a band or just a group of puck rockers. Sublime represents the long beach way of life. No other band expresses there own lives in there music as well as Sublime did. Furthermore no other sublime CD does this as well as Robbin the Hood. So if you heard one of sublime's songs and you thought it was kinda phat then buy their self titled. But if you have and like 40oz and second hand smoke then this album is one of Brad's must haves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sublime's Second Best","review":"Ok, this is one of Sublime's most creative albums and has some of the most dramatic songs that leads to Brad's death a few years later. This album shows unique samples such as the Cisco Kid and some great acoustics and instrumentals such as \\"Lincoln Highway\\" and Boss DJ. This album would be my favorite if it were not for 40 OZ. The other predessing albums were more of radio hits than Sublime's inner creativity but don't get me wrong all of their albums deserve an A plus. People who aren't real Sublime fans probably won't understand this album because it doesnt have \\"Wrong Way\\" or some other popular song. But for the diehard Sublime fan, this is an absolute must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"you'll enjoy it more with every listen","review":"one thing that you have to give sublime, is that they can really nail a beat.

Glad I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sublime Strikes Again, Good Tunes","review":"I'm saying this CD was great for the most part, but it's not the same as their other two albums that came out while Sublime was still all alive. I'd say the highlights of the songs on this CD are as follows: Greatest Hits, STP, Work that We Do, Boss DJ, All You Need, Freeway Time in LA County Jail, Mary, and that bonus hidden track with that awesome version of Don't Push. There was a lot of filler on this CD, with many of the tracks containing no lyrics or minimal lyrics. There's one where they're just talking to music to some guy. Some of the non-lyrical tracks were good, though.I would say that this is their weakest CD. It's still great, though. There are so many good songs on there. Just not as many as 40 oz. or Sublime's self-titled album. Even Second Hand Smoke beats it by a small margin. Of course, this is just my opinion. Definitely worth it for the songs I named above and maybe a couple more you might like. Give it a shot. It's definitely worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"buy it for the good songs","review":"I am a huge and hardcore sublime fan. 40oz. to freedom is my second all time fav. album.

Trust me, give this album a chance, dont listen to the first 4 songs and throw it away. keep listening, itll grow on you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robin' the Hood is a great CD for everyone","review":"For everyone who enjoyed 40 oz to Freedom, Robin' the Hood is the next logical step on the road to becoming a true Sublime fan. Robin' the Hood is much more experimental then their previous CD, 40 oz, but all the more fun. The band lets loose, showcasing their musical abilities, and their talent of writing great songs. There are a number of remarkable tracks on this CD including an amazing guitar solo \\"Falling Idols\\" and an incredible bass-ballad \\"Stepping Razor\\". While many of the songs are sound clips, or obviously just the band messing around, you can't ignore the genius behind this CD. \\"Saw Red\\", \\"Boss DJ\\" and the infamous \\"Pool Shark\\" call Robin' the Hood home, making this CD worthy or anyone's collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another GREAT CD to get stoned to...","review":"WOW, this is a blow your mind album, recorded on a 4 track recorder throughout Bradley's home (gotta love those minimalist ehtics) this CD is odley sofisticated with a bizzare mix of different sfx, samples little tunes, and comical commentary from Raleigh Theodore Saker.

Also you wont like it the first time you listen to it because of the stuff in between the songs. My advice is to go straight to the 4th song the first time you listen to it. Give it a chance but its not their best by far. I would buy the selftitled first to get into sublime then 40 oz. The album 40 oz. is better but the selftitled is a good introduction to sublime. Also the sound is pretty shady this is because it was made in living rooms on a 4-track recorder. Although is not great like 40 oz. but its definitley worth buying cause its better than any thing out now.

Overall great for true Sublime fans, but an acquired liking for others."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing blend of music, still not Sublime's best","review":"This is Sublime's second real release, and although it isn't as good as 40oz to Freedom or the self titled cd, but this cd might examplify sublime's genre clashing the best. This cd has everything from the jazz/Blues like sounds of waiting for bud and Freeway time in LA county jail, the funky beat of songs like the B Loop Dubs, Q-Ball, Work That We Do, Cisco Kid and I don't care to uch for Reggage Dub. To the ska punk sounds of Pool shark, Saw Red, Greatest Hits, STP, Falling idols and All you need, plus laid back acoustic numbers (Poolshark(acoustic) Boss DJ, Mary and crazy spoken word from Raleigh Theodore Sakers in Raleigh soliloquy's. Some of this cd was recored at the famous west beach records but most of it was rcored on Brad's 4-track in various houses and living rooms around LBC.

It starts off with a bunch of fans screaming over a boy band, played by Seth Green, Breckin Meyer, and a couple others. This short beginning may well be the only funny part of the movie because of the actors. However, the rest of the movie goes down hill from there. I found myself waiting for it to be over. Though I like Rachael Leigh Cook, all three girls were boring and obnoxious - especially the ditzy Melody (played by Tara Reid). Rosario Dawson was a worthy effort out of the trio, the only one with a little brains.

The notion that Americans are jumping around from one to another (\\"orange is the new pink\\") has been done much better before. The only inspired part of the film involves the opening with the boy band DuJour, which ends all too soon. I guess 12 year old girls may like this film.

That's about all I can say. There wasn't really a plot, which is fine, because half the people that see this movie will probably be 13 year old girls. The acting was good and points, and REALLY tired in others. Some moments are funny, but others seem to fail to capture the fun and imagination that the cartoon had.The film follows three singer/songwriters who happen to dress like cats. They hit it big, and have to adjust to their new surroundings. I think I summorized in 2 sentenses what took about and hour and a half to explain in the movie( that should say something).One of the reasons I found the movie to be stupid, was because they were going against what they were preaching.

It's a great movie to watch with your girlfriends. The story is about three small-town girls from Riverdale USA who have their own band and a manager. One day they get \\"discovered\\" and sign a recording contract. Along the way to fame and fortune, they discover they are being used to sell products via subliminal messages in their music. The record exes are really out-there, as are some of the other minor characters, but Josie, Melody and Valerie remain true to the original Archie characters. Alan M and the Cabots are even featured.I love the Josie and the Pussycats songs (though the DeJour songs could use some work). I even have the soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Josie and the Pussycats is the best movie EVER\\"","review":"No, it's not, but that is a line in the movie and it is about subliminal messages, so I can't help but describe the movie that way. :) It's really quite funny and a lot of fun to watch.

In recalling the cartoon of the same name, it made me even more curious as to the results of this movie. While there were some humorous parts, overall it was a big disappointment. The music was not good, the acting was not good, and the plot was not good. In essense ... the movie was not good ... just a bunch of hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow","review":"My review is simple and to the point. This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

I left wondering why I'd even wasted my time on this piece of garbage. 'Josie and the Pussycats' resembles the Spice Girls music flick with a similar plot 'Spiceworld'. Both movies are dumb, dim-witted, badly acted, and follow a weak script. It's a shame, Rachel Leigh-Cook, Tara Reid, and Alan Cummings are fantastic actors. They should be embarassed to have appeared in something like this!'Josie and the Pussycats' is obviously geared towards younger kids, so maybe I wasn't suppposed to like it, but I at leats should have enjoyed SOME of it! My eight year old sister and her friends love this movie, so I recommend it for anyone under the age of nine years. I'm a movie lover, so it's hard for me to truly dislike a movie.

But I have to say right off that Josie was FUN! I have been a fan of punk/power pop for over 25 years, and the music itself was marvellous. But when you add the funny, and campy story right out of the tv show, you have a winner! For those of you either too old or too young to have seen Josie on TV. Let me tell you that the story was something that would have been a great original episode of the series. Yes it was a little goofy, but that was the whole idea. It was something to enjoy, not critique.

But others, like a bedraggled looking Tara Reid, don't improve what is already a scattershot film with sloppy writing and choppy direction. The notion that Americans are jumping around from one to another (\\"orange is the new pink\\") has been done much better before. The only inspired part of the film involves the opening with the boy band DuJour, which ends all too soon.The movie also has so many product placements it is distracting. The filmmakers apparently are trying to make this seem funny. But it's just like a huge shameful commercial. Acutally commercials usually show more cleverness than this film.I guess 12 year old girls may like this film. But I doubt anyone else will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Josie and the Pussycats -- What were they thinking...","review":"Just what were they thinking when they made this movie?

The highest rating I dare give this film is 2 stars.\\"Josie and the Pussycats\\" is one BIG ad for fast food chains, shopping malls, and music stores. Though the casting for the 'band\\", \\"Josie and the Pussycats\\" was well done. The movie itself had no real plot. The villians were cheesy.This comic/cartoon should have never made it to the big screen.If what this movie was looking for was laughs, I didn't find any.

However, the boys are never to know that they are twins, for if they find out, so superstition says, they will both immediately die.Of course, as years pass, the boys do meet and become best friends. They become 'Blood Brothers' and are always there for each other. But as they get older, they see the differences their social classes have brought upon them.

I had to FORCE myself to watch the entire thing just because I paid $15 for it, and I'm still angry over wasting my money. The only things they got right were the names of the characters, and even then, not entirely. Who the h*** is King Tygath??? And when did the Tombs of Atuan become a place of good and light???

While the effects were nicely done and the magic smoothly incorporated the real flaw in EARTHSEA was the dialogue and acting.Shawn Ashmore, while not what you would call a 'bad actor' most definately needs supporting cast, we've seem him in several films (X-men notably) but he needs help. He had none. The rest of the cast was a jumble of men and women who either stumbled over their lines or overdid in moments that were laughable.EARTHSEA's plot had a lot of promise, the books were decently done and well worth the read, but this movie... well it definately falls short of what it should have been. The character's weren't correctly cast and the script was poorly thought out.

Many are good actors in their own right, but weren't right for the parts.With that said, I ask anyone and everyone looking to watch this mini-series to steer clear of it... very clear of it. Go straight for the books. Personally, I got in to Earthsea by watching the mini-series... enjoying it... not knowing what had been done to it. After reading the first book, I can honestly say that what has been done is wrong. Visit the author's site for more info: www.ursulakleguin.com. The changes are not simple changes to make it better suited for a film version. They are very large changes that change the entire story.Please read the books first.

The show was honestly nothing special and while mildy entertaining, could not be considered \\"good\\". For a lazy evening of TV, you could do worse. The one act of goodness that came from my viewing is that I purchased the Wizard of Earthsea to pass the time on a plane flight and after reading both that and the Tombs of Atuan, I realized what an injustice the movie had done to the books. Though many events are there, the plot is significantly different. I can understand how they tried to \\"Spice things up\\" for TV, but in this effort they failed by butchering many of the things that made the story deeply compelling.

Then I readThe Earthsea Trilogy, by Ursula K. Le Guin. Then I watched this movie again.Oh, brother!This movie has just enough of the elements of the Earthsea story by Le Guin to be familiar, but enough differences to be jarring. And don't get me started about the acting (or lack thereof), the fake sailing, the mixing of storylines, and even the juxtaposition of the names of Sparrowhawk/Ged.I wonder how many Earthsea fans watched this show with growing horror as the story progressed. I can just picture all the \\"What the...!!?\\" comments.You won't be taking this one as your one movie for the year on an island!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WORTHLESS","review":"This is the worst adaptation of a book to film that I have ever seen. it is as if the creators of the film never read the book and, judging it simply by the cover art, set out to make a film that would cause people to hate it. It is so bad, if you sit in on the shelf next to other films it will make them crappier as well. I feel sorry for the actors who had to muddle through this chancre and I feel awful for ANYONE who sees it and thinks it has anything to do with Ms. LeGuin's fantastic work.There is nothing worth recommending here. Not one thing. It betrays everything the original writer created with her stellar and beautiful series of books. Ignore this film. Ignore it with an ax, repeatedly, until it's not a film anymore.

Completely worthless.I would have given it a negative number rating but AMAZON doesn't allow that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful adoptation","review":"Very briefly: it was a great disappointment.

After reading all the Earthsea books, I was appalled at how much the movie DIDN'T follow the books it was based on.The special effects in this movie were just awful. Poorly done 3D graphics, as well as over used smoke machines and badly done blue screens. There was very little effort, or so it seems, put into creating realistic effects.The acting was absolutely abysmal. I will admit that Shawn Ashmore, and Kristen Kreuk were the best actors, but they are FAR above this type of cheap, cheesy film. I also enjoyed Chris Gauthier as Vetch.

Fully understanding why LeGuin disassociated herself from this production and it is pitiful that she was not consulted becuase with her assistance I do believe the production could have been much better since the visual effects and set were not all that atrocious.

I was captivated by the story told on the screen, the characters, and the rich musical score. I was so engrossed with the tale of wizards, magic, and friendship that I started reading the books the very day after seeing the first half of the mini series. I found somewhat sadly that the mini series did not follow the books very much, but I found that I could enjoy both for what they were. Some of the things that I like about the mini series is that it is a facinating story that is full of suspense and has a lot of great characters. I am grateful to the mini series because I would most likely not have been pulled into the books if I hadn't liked it so much. However, the books are wonderful in thier own way. So, I loved both forms of the story for thier own sake; I like the mini series for being a good story, and the books for being amazing tales of magic and people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another hair movie.","review":"The only good thing to say about this so-called adaptation of the Earthsea series is that you need less than 15 seconds to see how poorly made it is.Those 15 seconds were enough to give that screen writers, producers and directors around the world should have to get a license certifying that they can read at above a 6th-grade level before they are allowed to put anything on screen. That would save a lot of people a lot of money and grief. In addition, people like the ones who made this mini-series would be forced to do something meaningful with their lives.If you can't read, don't make movies based on books. Become a quick-fry cook or waiter. Do something that benefits the people around you.If you can read, read Ursula K. LeGuin's Earthsea series.

Instead, it feels like a total strip down of the story; like Ms. Le Guin's discarded first draft.As a fantasy by-the-books movie, I can recommend this only to people who are just looking to pass a few hours.But, as has been expressed below by Ms Pamela Thomas, I am worried that people will see this and completely ignore the books. If I hadn't read the books and saw the movie my first reaction would be: \\"Oh boy, those Le Guin books sure are overrated.\\" And that can't be further from the truth!Skip the movie, read the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible: horrible, horrible...","review":"If it were physically possible to make a *worse* adaptation of Ursula K. LeGuin's award-winning EarthSea series, I'm sure SciFi would have tried. The actors, all talented, make the best of their material but there's not much there to work with. The mistakes, the bloopers, the incoherent storyline...has Ed Woods been reanimated, and why?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Le Guin fans will be disappointed","review":"Don't waste your money!If you are a fan of the Earthsea series of books, you will be sorely disappointed in this miniseries. I was so disappointed, I couldn't even finish watching it when it was originally aired on the SciFi Channel! The acting was poor and the dialogue was contrived. It had none of the sublime spiritual beauty of Le Guin's text, and the inner lives and struggles of the characters were not as clearly portrayed. In all, I found it to be juvenile and superficial. There is absolutely nothing of the spirit of the books in this miniseries!Apparently, people who have not read the books have enjoyed this miniseries. I tried to imagine what I would think of it if I had not read the books, and could only conclude that maybe I would have liked it if I had seen it during middle school or earlier. In otherwords, adult fans of fantasy: don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best to dissociate it completely from the books","review":"This film version of the classic Earthsea books bears almost no resemblance to them whatsoever - even the names of the characters were reversed. If you loved the books you will most likely hate this movie.As a work of art, the film is not bad, I suppose. The visual effects are decent and the sets are pretty good, but the acting is mediocre. Overall the film is underwhelming compared to other recent fantasy adaptations."},{"rating":"1","title":"A travesty of the wonderful original","review":"It's been a while since I read all the 'Earthsea' books but even my imperfect memory could tell me that this was dreadfully wrong. What a pathetic rendering of a marvellous tale. Without Le Guin's wonderful language, a TV adaptation was always going to be risky, but this just fell flat on its face. My teenage son wandered in, looked, laughed, and went out. I just sat and watched in anguish. Who, having seen that and not knowing the original, is going to go out and read the books?But that's what everyone must do - read the books and let your mind supply the visuals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"I feel that if I had never read the books this movie would have been at best mediocre. Since I have read them, I think it's terrible. I was unable to even watch most of it so I'm not really able to give more of a review than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you can't be true to the STORY, leave it alone!!!","review":"Notice I said story and not book. Nobody expects a movie script to follow a book verbatim. But come on.... I have read the books and enjoyed them very much. My wife has not read them. Ten minutes after sitting down to watch the movie my wife asked if they were keeping true to the story. I replied by saying that in the books there was no priestess, no \\"bad guy\\", Ged was a young child with dark skin, and there were no girlfriends. If these things were removed from the movie there would be literally be nothing left. To sum it up: The dialog is hackneyed, the plot sucks, the effects are awful, the acting is dreadful, and even the costumes make no sense given the time and location the story takes place. Avoid this one like the plague and read the books instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"terribly disappointing","review":"This movie should not even have Earthsea in the title. It is an absolute insult to both Ursula K. LeGuin and her readers. This movie has terrible casting, bad acting, no adherence to the plot or even the most basic of concepts from the books.Do yourself a favor and don't even bother.Shame on you sci-fi channel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Weak storyline, mostly due to the fact that they butchered the plot of the original books. The books do not follow a typical Hollywood storyline, as they lack a specific villain or a romance. So, the producers of this mini-series decided to add those elements, plus a battle scene. The special effects were ok, but the dialogue is just bad and the characters are whiny and uninteresting.Bottom line: go see Harry Potter, or LOTR again. You aren't missing much by skipping this miniseries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad, such a disservice","review":"I will admit I'm another long-time Earthsea and Ursula Le Guin fan, so I looked forward to this series with high hopes, especially after Scifi did such a good job with the Dune miniseries. I knew things had to be adapted to make it work visually, but I didn't expect a total rewrite. I yelled at the TV before 5 minutes had passed, and almost didn't bother watching the second segment. They took beautiful, mystical stories and turned them into a mediocre young-beautiful-people-versus-evil-guy-trying-to-take-over-the-world plot. I'm so very disappointed. I just couldn't find anything to like at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a bad adaptation ...","review":"It's just a bad film fullstop. I am a long time Le guin fan, but am not in the least bit purist. I wasn't expecting a faithful adaptation and was prepared to judge this film on its own merits. Unfortunately, with or without reference to the book this is a truly awful movie. Acting is so-so, the CGI is amateurish, the dialogue stinks (particularly so in the region of the denouement) and the narrative thread is an absolute tangle.The way people seem to whizz from one end of Earthsea to the other by boat in a matter of minutes beggars belief and exposes the sheer incompetence of the screenwriters. Roke University is more Rowlings than Le Guin. The dragon Orm Embar lacked all context and would have been better left out altogether. Possibly the worst feature of all was the \\"nameless ones\\"; instead of the ancient beings of immense power and evil that the movie had been trying to build up to, we were given overgrown bats!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a load of ........!!","review":"My goodnesss - when I saw 'Earthsea' advertised to be shown on TV today I was sat all ready, excited, with my easter egg and cup of tea, ready to be enthralled by an on screen version of one of my favourite books! What can I say? Whatever book the screen writers and script editors read to adapt this film was not the book I know and love.Ged - white? What! And what's a twenty something guy doing playing him? I sat there screaming at the screen and yelling at my husband (who hasn't read the books) --- every 10 -15 seconds my scream of rage rang out 'That didn't happen, who is he? He wasn't in the book, she wasn't a priestess, he didn't die like that, he didn't kill him, he wasn't called that, he died saving him, there was a dragon in this bit, the boat had EYES' etc etc etc.If you have read the books AVOID THIS, especially if, like me, you are of a explosive temperment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Star is One Too Many","review":"Having re-read the original EarthSea trilogy a couple of months before this show aired on the Sci Fi channel, I was appalled at what the writers did to the story. They basically took the concepts or themes that were in the book and and tore the story apart, rewriting it completely. It made very little sense compared to the books, and even if you didn't read the books (I know folk who didn't) the story made no sense. They turned into a poor vehicle for a couple of good looking (no-talent) young actors, and that's about it. I was sorry to see Isabella Rosellini and Danny Glover waste their incredible talents on this piece of schlock. I only saw part one, and that's two hours of my life I will never get back. I have lost all respect (what little I had) for the Sci Fi Channel after this travesty."},{"rating":"1","title":"The antithesis of LeGuin's series","review":"Whoever adapted this tale to the screen completely missed the points Ursula K. LeGuin made in her series. The diversity of the races and cultures in Earthsea has been stripped away, and we are left with the whitebread version. Tenar's order has been transformed from an evil cult offering human sacrifices to false gods to a group of religious who are holding back the tide of evil by virtue of their faith. The only good thing I can say about the series (aside from the music) is that it made me go back and read the books again, to make sure I wasn't completely misremembering them."},{"rating":"1","title":"yucch!","review":"I love Ursula Leguin's books, and the Earthsea series in particular (though Tehanu seemed a bit like a Church of Feminism lecture at times, and I *hate* preachy stories), but I was appalled by this SciFi channel adaptation. Cheap? Cheesy? Puerile? Unprofessional?And *WHAT WERE THEY THINKING* when they decided to swap the protagonist's use name and true name? Did they read the book before writing the screenplay? I confess that I did not watch to the end, but I cannot imagine how Leguin's powerful climactic scene plays out with the names reversed -- yechh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad at all, of course books are better","review":"To address one review, if the people who produced this spent 100's of millions of dollars, I'm sure it would have been as good as the LOTR. Can't compare the two, unfair.My kids both loved this. They are 8 and 12. My 12 year old girl read the books and she knows how movies change from books. She also liked the shadow as well.As for the name change, it does not really matter much in the whole scheme of the movie. There were times you had to think, but for the most part it is good entertainment (...). It costs my family twice that to go to the movies unless we hit the cheap times.Get it watch a time or two and sell it to someone else (...). They get a good deal and it ends up costing you the same as a rental. If you like it, more so the better. It's a keeper for our family."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing film","review":"A lover of Earthsea for many years, I and my high school fantasy class students eagerly awaited the debut of this film on SciFi Channel. We were all disappointed. The filmmakers made too many bad choices and strayed too far from what made LeGuin's novel excellent. From casting a white Ged and characterizing Vetch as a clueless slob of a sidekick to complete inventions like the invasion of Roke-it's painful to watch. LeGuin herself apologized to her fans for the film. Occasionally, the makers get things right: Earthsea is beautiful and some scenes are good like when Ogion sees Ged as a bird and declares \\"I named you.\\" These only serve as painful reminders of what could have been. I purchased the movie large to share clips with future students so that they could see more clearly what they have come to love about Earthsea through its absence in the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author disowned - need more?","review":"Then keep reading. This movie was totally awful. LeGuin disowned the book on her website because she got so ticked off that the SciFi Channel was trying to say she'd approved of it. READ THE BOOKS AND LEAVE THIS JUNK ALONE!!! But...Danny Glover was pretty good. Storyline just got mangled beyond comprehension - as an example, Ged and Tenar's relationship was totally different. He was her way into a new world and new way of thinking, and thought of her in the books as a kind of protegee. No romance til later in the series!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"very very very very very loosely based on Ursula K. Le Guin's trilogy","review":"Guess I have come to expect more from the Sci Fi Channel.....(well except for that Children of Dune thing)The movie is hardly recognizable as being based on the first two books of the trilogy(if the third is in there I missed it) The Tombs of Atuan is not even closely related to the story and I really can't figure out why...it was a great book, my favorite of the four in the series.Changing it did nothing for the plot whatsoever....The special effects are ok, the dragon is kind of cool, but if you are an Earthsea fan, expect a very different story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all","review":"I haven't read the EARTHSEA books, so I am not able to comment on this as a faithful or unfaithful representation of them. However, even as a movie, I felt that this miniseries was more than lacking. It lacked flow, the CGI looked like an animated computer game, the characters were one-dimensional, and the story so abbreviated that even moments obviously intended to be moving came off without passion. I have seen good and faithful book adaptations. I have even seen good and faithful book adaptations done by Scifi Channel (Dune springs to mind). This is not one of them.

Just Stay Away from this...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwatchable","review":"After the moderate success of Sci-Fi's Dune (and subsequentially, Children of Dune) mini-series, Legend of EarthSea looked like it had promise. The production values were high, and the commercials promised a somewhat unique setting. That, unfortunately, turned out to be the furthest thing from the truth.Legend of EarthSea is little more than a pile of tired fantasy clich��s, polished up by the decent production values. It wasn't enough to keep me interested, however. Every time a character began to talk, I cringed. There were several characters whose sole purpose was to provide needless, boring exposition.I'm sincerely convinced that Sci-Fi has fallen into the habit of hiring failed, hack fantasy authors to pen each new \\"original\\" series. I guess it accomplishes the task of increasing their profit margin, but it's gotten to the point where I'll only tune in to watch re-runs of older, far better shows like FarScape."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Crime against literature","review":"The DVD rendering of the \\"earthsea\\" series is far worse than the unjustified change to the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" by Peter Jackson.

I think this is only my 2nd cd with Marais music on it so I was interested to see if it was as good as the Marais stuff on Jordi Savall's Tous les Matins du Monde. I would say that I liked it about as much as that cd, except for the Couplets de Folies. On that track I thought the viol was too low in the mix. It wasn't \\"front and centre\\" like it is in Savall's version. Of the rest of the pieces on the disc the D major suite (tracks 5-10) is definitely my favourite; it's mostly slow & simltaneously happy & sad somehow. I think the other two suites are almost as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"Vertigo's Patto needed to prove nothing when they released Hold Your Fire. After the jazzy debut,Patto, in 1970 they had at least artistically made their mark.Hold Your Fire is far more rock oriented. The songs are condensed. But what really makes this album an early 1970s rock ace is Ollie Hassle's guitar work.Hassle was quicksilver, but when rock guitar mastery meant accelerated blues, not noise flash. Hassle took those classic blues scales and could rocket quick as Jeff Beck, right side up, upside down, sideways. His approach may seem sleepy now that we have been through Van Halen and 1980s top of the neck flash, but trust me, creatively, Hassle has far more depth.The tracks here are fantastically written, and if you are ready for a cooker after the subtleties of Patto's debut, this will slam home the goods.Go ahead.

It's a handy pruning saw, but I'm a bit disappointed. I might add that the fit and feel is quite good, but the blade flexes a bit too much.Gary Peterson"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I bought this book along with \\"Natural Healing For Animals\\" by the same author, looking for \\"Hands On\\" information.

Not very convincing. This is what I thought over and over. Until finally I decided to try it.

However, I took it to to the driving range a few times over the week, and it was really simple to use. Whats even more impressing is that it works!! I started off just practicing my chips and pitching shots. On my first day on the course after having only practiced with the device 3 times at the range, my swing showed improvement. That day I shaved 10 strokes from my previous score on the same course.

In my opinion this is priced 25 bucks too much. It mainly helps you hinge your wrist on the back swing and nothing else. There is SOOOO much more to a golf swing than hinging your wrist! My opinion- pass on this product and get some lessons -preferably an instructor that records your swing and analyzes it with you one on one afterwards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Golf swing aid","review":"This is quite a bit of money to pay for a piece of plastic, but well worth it.

But actually it didn't work for me at all. It is not worth it. The hinge between the club and your wrist is just one small thing in the whole golf swing.

I practiced with it for 10 minutes a day for 3 days then hit the range. I could see instantly that my swing was in to out every time. Not only was my slice gone, but I was hitting a draw. I played the next day and shot an 80. My old sliced drives averaged about 210 to 220 yards, and I hit several 250 during the round with the draw.

Through muscle memory, I am able to go to the driving range and be able to fix aspects of my swing.

Do they expect us to modify our cars to fit this so-called replacement part? It was also not possible to use the rubber element from this Anco part to replace the deteriorated element in the existing wiper frame, as the element is too wide. This part is totally useless to me.I just purchased a replacement that DOES fit from my local NAPA store, NAPA \\"Exact Fit\\" #60-011-A.

Home Depot, which sells this grinder, did not have any brushes for this tool when I recently visited. If you're only going to use grinding wheels, you can probably find them easily enough.

You can certainly save a nickel by getting this one, but unless you are on a super-tight budget, get a 4 1/2\\" version.One positive on this tool: if I'm not mistaken, it is designed to be used with AC and DC power, so you can run it off of a generator."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burnt Out","review":"This grinder worked fine with a four inch tile blade to make hand cuts on ceramic tile and slate.I used it with a segmented blade to chase a hairline crack on a concrete floor I was preping to tile and it burnt out after about four linear feet.I would not recomend it for anything but light duty use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This is one of the best albums of the year!

In fact, it made me cringe, jumping from track to track.I have picked up everything they ever produced, either as a group or solo, always loving their sound. I still believe Simon le Bon has the most creative lyrics and the most beautiful voice out there.The upside of this terrible album, is that the tour for this album does not reflect the album at all.

Unfortunately, this album will be quickly forgotten..as the Amazon numbers are proving. First off, Simon LeBon's voice is in the exact same register throughout this entire album. I was hoping for some maturity in his vocals. He still sounds like he's stuck in the 80's...But what's really lacking here are the hooks that I so fondly remember from Hungry Like The Wolf, The Reflex, Rio and Say A Prayer. I want a song that leaves me humming its melody, long after I take it out of the CD player. That's not happening. There isn't anything on here that even comes close to those gems. They're now a carbon copy of every other boy band out there, with a few more gray hairs. Sadly, I can only give this album 1 star. I don't see them having another shot at a comeback after this extreme letdown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astronaut Soars--","review":"If there was ever a band collaboration that has been able to consistently create and record upbeat, danceable and recognisable material, it is Duran Duran. Astronaut seemed like a risky endeavor, as so many years had passed between these members' lives and common working situation. Seeing the band perform in July 2003, I realized how capable they were of turning back the clock. Astronaut proves that they can do more than recreate the past, as the new material compares with the best of their careers.Considering that Astronaut was self-produced makes even more of an impression, as no one had to be called in to make it happen. They seem to be of one musical soul, and I am so glad they have shared that again after all of these years. And being a male fan of 47 years of age, I am not a speaking as a heart-throbber, but as a true critic and aficiando of popular music... they have lost nothing!

If you are a fan ( and if you've gotten this far , you are ) this album is quite good.

Gorgeous vocal melodies, hook-filled bass lines, synth effects and subtle but effective guitar power chords ( welcome back Andy Taylor !! ) all add up to the comeback of the year. Most all the songs on this disc I want to hear more than once ( a rarity in this age of throwaway pop music.) I couldn't find this Special Edition at my local chain store so I ordered this from Amazon and got it the day after it was released. The bonus DVD is great and only leaves me wanting more. The notes in the cd case - which is gorgeous - state that it is from the \\"upcoming live dvd\\" that is surely better than Arena,which was crap.

This album is just out of gas, safe, without inspiration or energy, complacent. I never thought I'd think that about a Duran Duran album. It's like an insult. Shoot: I was so looking forward to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"Huge disappointment. I have no doubt these tunes will be all over the discoth��ques next summer - these are dancing melodies, fun and full of funky sound, but very predictable, all right for teenagers. Sounds like a mix of old Jamiraquai (his disco tunes) combined with eight years old Freak Power . I would rather call this album \`cute' than \`strong'. Bass is missing. There are few nice (again, nice, not strong) songs at the end. Their 'Big Thing' sounds much more mature.Well, two stars since I am still a fan"},{"rating":"1","title":"I think I bought the wrong CD","review":"Some of the songs in this CD are good, but most of them are not. Song number 2 and 3, Desilusion and Despierta Boricua are great, but the rest are bad. Maybe you want to buy another CD rather than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have over 20 pair in this style","review":"I love this shoe ,it is so comfy and great to look at , the height is just right for a short girl who does'nt want to wear high heels all the time.

It does a fantastic job of that, and I can just leave all the settings in place so I get a consistent angle on my blades each time I reuse it. I sharpen everything else on my Tormak.My complaints are minor. The set up for the support under the blade should be simpler and not involve five knobs. It also is sloppy. Water and grind wheel gunk drip off the blade as you move it back and forth. It is not a neat process.I didn't want to buy one, but when the local tool company quit servicing tools and would no longer sharpen my blades, I had no choice. It took too much time and involved too much down time to drop off baldes one day and return later in the week to pick them up. It was cheaper to buy the sharpener than to buy an additional set of blades."},{"rating":"2","title":"Planer blade sharpner","review":"I have only sharpened two sets of blades to date and have found it to do a very good job, I found it very useful to read and set up properly before attempting to sharpen. One set of blades are 6\\" jointer blades and the second were 13\\" double edge thickness planer blades.I am impressed with the results."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy this","review":"It works fine, but I can't locate any other grinding wheels for it. I need a coarser wheel to grind nicks out of chisels, etc. My bench grinder will do that, but it overheats the steel. The cooling as the whole point of the very pricey wet grinder. What is the use of buying an expensive new machine if you can't get the necessary accessories for it? I've only had it one year, now the price has dropped [dramatically] - perhaps they're phasing this thing out.I would not recommend buying this. Find a machine which is supported by the dealer and the manufacturer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected more","review":"This unit is flimsy and not easy to set up. It's not easy to set up because the design of this machine is done very cheaply. If your using a course stone you will run out of water very quickly, which is not convenient. Very messy to use too. I did get the unit set up to sharpen some jointer blades and the results were ok. I honestly don't know much about sharpening and that is why I was hoping this machine would be straight forward to set up,use and get very good results. It's not. A good quality sharpener for blades and tools must cost a lot more! If possible, see one in action before you buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for cookie exchanges","review":"It has a lot of great recipes, and is very easy to follow. My family loves that I have this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book","review":"I bought a copy of this book for my sister in law with whom I live. We've tried a few of the recipes, and have found them uniformly decent. The \\"Field Guide\\" part is a little gimmicky, but still amusing, and it's worth reading through for entertainment value alone if you're into baking. It has useful tips and interesting facts dispersed throughout, as well as origin information on all the cookies. What really makes this book stand out is its binding: the spiral binding should be standard for all cookbooks.This rating approved by Samantha Biddlecom, cookbook owner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for New Bakers","review":"I decided to bake Christmas cookies for the first time this year. I ordered several books and this one is the best. Its not too overwhelming. The layout nice and the sprial binding makes it easy to use.

But, its good for the basics and for those starting out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recipes are a bust so far...","review":"While I must agree with all the reviews before me about the binding, photos, history, symbols, etc... I cannot agree with those who actually reviewed the recipes and products made from this book. I am not a novice baker, so I feel I can point some of the blame on the recipes when the finished product doesn't turn out as advertised. Maybe one recipe isn't the best - okay I get it. Perhaps this amount was a typo - I get that, too (though you'd think cookbooks would be extra careful on the typo-front!). But so far three for three of the cookies made in this book have somehow NOT worked out as advertised. Either a crumb or a crust didn't come together during cooking, or in one case the balled cookies melted into one giant puddle on the pan! So far NOT impressed... even the binding and pretty pictures can't help a book if the content isn't tested - or even properly edited. So watch out when buying this book, or just go buy a different one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute concept, great recipes","review":"The concept of this book, writing it as if it were a bird field guide or flower field guide, is cute. Cute is subjective, but even is cute isn't your thing the cookie recipes will be. Every cookie recipe has a picture, well laid out ingredients, easy to follow instructions. Cookies that are a little more complicated are taken step by step making them accessible to almost any level of baking experience. The entire books is friendly and inviting, not intimidating. Beginner cooking makers and advanced will both find something to make in this book.Of course, the most important thing is the taste, and the recipes deliver. The cookies I've made have all been very good. I especially liked the nutmeg logs because it was really fun to watch the fluffy icing turn into this coating on the cookie just like the recipe said it would. There is even a dog biscuit recipe for your pooch, so no one in the family is left out."},{"rating":"1","title":"DTS recording cannot be read","review":"I bought this CD because of the DTS recording. I had 4 other DTS recording before and marvelled at the quality of 5.1 recordings. Unfortunately, the sample I have produces only white noise. If you do not have the proper decoder you might hear white noise but I tried it on two DVD players rated with DTS decoding and which play my other DTS CDs. I also tried it on my computer using multiple software players (like VLC)that can read DTS. Zip nada on this one, just white noise....I did not bother contacting the vendor (probably because I am lazy). I cannot judge the quality of the recording which I never heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst disc I have ever purchased","review":"This sounds like one guy playing an organ or synthesizer.

He was at times very nasty and demanding of the cast he worked with. He also had lots of friend. This book chronicles his childhood through to his death. The author spends time detailing both the ballet part of Robbins life and the Broadway part. Unless you are a dancer, the Broadway life is much more interesting. There are loads of interesting facts in this book. For instance ,Mary Martin was considered for the lead in Funny Girl !!! Jerome Robbins life was fascinating. His story is easy to read and really holds your interest. Advice, skim the ballet sections."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and vulgar","review":"Very little to do with dance, this book is mostly personalities and scandal.

The \\"TOC Read\\" seemed to be the problem. Amazon replaced it with no fuss. I wouldn't recommend this machine. Since it replaced a Pioneer 6 CD changer I bought way back in 1990, it's a mystery why this machine must pause to \\"read\\" each disc while you're standing there waiting to hear music. The shuffle play is terrible, since it heavily favors certain CDs over others, and worse, plays up to four cuts in a row from the same CD. Not my idea of random or shuffle play. The Pioneer it replaced was 15 years older technology, yet the Pioneer was superior in every way. The Pioneer's random play was awesome...no repeats, no loooong pauses to read each CD, no two cuts in a row from the same CD, and it didn't favor any one Cd over another.

McGriff shows that he's already a master of blues- and soul organ and particulary on \\"There Will Never Be Another You\\" you hear his playing tribute to his mentor - Jimmy Smith.

Yes, they have turned more towards the electronic side of things, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. \\"Nursery Rhyme\\" uses the drum machine in the perfect way and the song ends up being probably the best song on the entire album. My only complaint is that the album is VERY short. Many of the songs are short in length and the album ends after about 33 minutes.

This time around he has a backing band that does an excellent job considering the short time they were able to prepare for this gig. The mixture of old and new material was very well presented. The setting for this outdoor concert was suberb and it was nice to 'take-in' the scenary and relaxed atmosphere while listening to Shawn's music.

I cant do the inside of cars with what it has packed with it. Surprised and somewhat let down for the price paid. There is no clear cut order form or whom to contact for parts. The hose does not rotate in its locking collar so it is prone to kink and must be unwound before putting an attachment on it..... a decided disadvantage.So c'mon Hitachi, get on the stick...............I would have liked MORE satisfaction for the price, but, I amhappy with the unit.

What a sweet, inspiring, charming and delightful surprise -- just what the doctor ordered for a dismal winter day! These short essays are perfect for reading one at a time, at random, whenever you want to digest something short but very meaningful and lovely. I keep it on my nightstand, and wish there were more books of essays like this -- today I am newly inspired to look at the beautiful, simple things around me with fresh reverence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Direct Replacement","review":"Good quality mount.

No grains of any sort are detectable, and I wanted something crunchy. On the other hand, if one is craving dates, this bar will satisfy the desire. I have given 5 star ratings to other Pure Bar flavors, but this one totally disappointed me. I wish I could return the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so","review":"I have tried several other of the PURE bars and really enjoy their flavor and overall taste! However, the chocolate chip trail mix is a disappointment. I like chocolate and thought this would be a nice alternative to the brownie bar, but it doesn't even have a hint of chocolate, at least in the common sense of chocolate. The flavor otherwise is decent and edible, but I would prefer one of the others if going purely on the name as an indication of taste. Especially if buying a full case of this, I would try to find a single bar locally and give it whirl first."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Pure Bars. Hate this flavor!","review":"I have tried nearly every flavor. I love Pure Bars. Great quality and wonderful tasting. I do NOT like this particular flavor though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious - and just a bit chewy","review":"\\"Trail Mix\\" should have been the first two words because I don't really taste much of the chocolate chips, but otherwise this is very good tasting bar. I like most if not all of Pure Bar's products and this one doesn't disappoint: chewy, not too sweet, a little crunch from the seeds and nuts and very nutritious. I wish there had been more chocolate chips but that's just repeating others' observations. Overall, I recommend this and will get it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"These ideas can help increase the value of ANY home!","review":"Home buyers as well as home sellers will learn how to increase the value of ANY home.

If you have a shoe repair place near you, they can resole and recondition your birks pretty darn easily.One hint from years of wearing these is make sure you keep the cork beds in the back of the shoe coated with a sealant.

However the same size for this clog didn't fit nearly the same. The ridge that supposed to be sitting behind the toes was placed too far forward. Therefore instead of providing support \\"behind\\" my toes, now they're \\"under\\" my toes. Unlike a sandal you could only push your feet so far forward because of enclosed nature. Other than that the support is almost identical to the Arizona. If you do order this clog and you're using the Arizona as sizing reference, you may want to try ordering 1 size up. But then again not sure if you will lose the proper arch and heel cup support due to being oversized. Overall, will not recommend. Max 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is such a CUTE DVD ...","review":"I watched this recently .. a friend gave it to me for Xmas as a gag, we've been buddies for over 30 years .. but amazingly, Donny's actually very good and I'd have figured he'd had more videos or DVD's out by now. The part where he duets with himself on \\"Go Away Little Girl\\" from video taken 30 years ago did kind of bring a mild tear to my eye .. and when my friend and I watched it together, we reminisced about all those years ago being 'crazy in love with Donny Osmond' while watching that piece.Donny seems to have turned into quite the talented performer, very classy and polite. My youngest daughter and I met him a number of years ago and he seemed to be the same when we met him as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Donny Osmond Live","review":"A great DVD -- wonderful Live Concerta good buy --this dvd as well as Donny Live in Edinburgh castle is worth every penny --great music -- his new cd \\" That is what i meant to say\\" is also worth a listen too --Thank you Donny for the great music that you are sharing with us"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show but dvd quality bit odd.","review":"Look, the show is really great. The sound is superb. But I don't not if its just my dvd but the tracking of people movements seem odd. Sort of blurry or something. So when Donny bobbing around, like he does, its not a smooth flowing transaction, its like there's a dithering image thing going on.Makes it very hard to watch. I'd be interested in other people's comment on this.BUT OTHER THAN THIS - it's a fabulous show and well worth getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Experience","review":"This concert video was a wonderful experience. I have always loved Donny and wanted to see his performance in the United Kingdom. He's an incredible performer. He not only touches the hearts of his fans in concert, but also is not afraid of shaking hands, giving hugs and kisses to those lucky enough to make eye contact with him. He has a wonderful stage presence and works the stage and his audience with professionalism. Definitely a unforgettable performance and 15 minute documentary."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first love!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed watching this DVD.

In our shop, the Hitachi has trouble resawing anything wider than about 6 inches and hard woods like maple and white oak just compound the problem. Feed rates need to be kept very low in order to keep the motor from stalling. Most of our resawing is still done on an old 18\\" Oliver bandsaw which runs rings around this thing. The only impressive thing about the Hitachi is its price. For the money, this tool has been a real dissapointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Over priced under powered","review":"I obtained this saw from one of my Doctors hobby shop. I got it for $610.00. At this pice it is worth the money. I am a one man shop building custom furniture. It is great for matching pannels. It is underpowered for production. I was a tool and die maker with General Motors in the 60's. I took the saw apart and rebuilt it. There is no vibration and it cuts streight as an arrow. If you find a used one and need a dedicated resaw this one is great for the small shop. It shoud come with a 3hp motor and the price shoud be under $2,000 with all the guide attachments. The quality is top notch, no complaints in that department. I use a 3\\" carbide skip tooth blade on the saw. I never take it off. Happy Sawing."},{"rating":"1","title":"over priced / horrible","review":"Saw has terrible performance. Underpowered. 3\\" blade will not track streight and has huge chatter / vibration.

I was severly let down when the movie came to an end just over 30 minutes. WARNING if you do not play or know much of anything about the game do not get the movie you will have wasted your money. Grant it the movie is a little behind where the game is but it really dropps you off expecting more. If you do know about and follow the game then dowload the movie for free, borrow it from a friend but i wouldn't pay for it. $8 for 30 minutes of movie it's not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Micromemo - Nasty Signal to Noise Ration but J&R service is great","review":"I was very disappointed to find the signal to noise ratio on the Micromemo was terrible - 40dB, akin to a cheap cassette recorder of yester year.

Where it fails is mostly Apple's fault. The battery life is dismal once you hook this device up to the iPod. I can barely get a 2 hour class recorded before it turns itself off. I also froze the iPod twice trying to pause or stop a recording to get more recording time. The actual device fails where it records a huge wav file that has to be converted to a smaller format. This is really a waste of space and time.If you are looking for a good recorder that saves down to an mp3 file very easily and quickly, then go for the Sony ICD-P520 ($50-$60). The software is easy to use and the device will store almost 30 hours at high quality. It works great for recording lectures."},{"rating":"1","title":"it skips every 2 minutes","review":"when i first used this product i was immediately angered as i realized that my recordings had skips in them almost every 20 seconds, that is to say, i would be reading something and five of the words would be missing. i fumed for two days then tried recording on low quality. that seemed to solve the problem but that was perhaps only because i pressed the pause button every twenty seconds, incidentally there is no difference between high and low quality. but then the problem started back up again though this time at a much less aggravating intensity since it skipped only every two minutes. this is still very painful and damaging since i record poetry recitals almost every week and i also use it to practice foreign languages on a daily basis! the sound quality is barely above acceptable as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT GOOD","review":"THIS MIC WILL NOT WORK OVER HALF THE TIME, WASTE OF TIME, THERE IS NO WAY YOU CANTELL IF IT IS WORKING UNTILL YOU ARE DONE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for moino recording (voice)","review":"Products only flaw is not being stereo.

I would attach the microphone and it wouldn't register that it was attached. If I held the microphone in sometimes it would register. When I tried recording a few songs, it said it was recording, but nothing played back when I listened to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely usable","review":"The main reason I got this recorder was to record phone conversations of sales calls for my notes at work. I got a RadioShack device that plugs into the phone and then has a jack that goes to a mic. input. The RadioShack device works fine with a tape recorder but with the XtremeMac IPV-MIC-00 MicroMemo Digital Voice Recorder I can hear myself OK (much quieter than I'd like) but the person on the other end is barely audible most of the time. I've tried every possible setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great, totally worth it!","review":"I use this to record piano parts for audition songs, songs I've written, etc. It gets a little buzzy when it's too close to whatever is making noise (especially musical instruments) Great for picking up speech-level audio. More than decent at picking up music, the only downside, like I said, is that you have to have the iPod and mic across the room if the room has any kind of echo. Throwing a blanket or jacket over the mic helps a little.Overall, it helps me a lot just about every day, and it's TOTALLY worth it. Can't beat the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't do the one thing it's supposed to do decently","review":"I took this device traveling with me and created many memos over a 2 month period. I quickly realized that the Micromemo recorder was dropping large sections of speech every 30 or 60 seconds (depending on selected sound quality), which was needless to say extremely frustrating and would warrant a 1 star rating on its own. I kept recording anyway because it was the only thing I had around to use, and upon returning home it did me the kindness of deleting 2/3 of my memos anyway because it failed to sync properly--no joke. So in my experience, it doesn't work recording, and it doesn't work syncing either, so there's really no reason at all to waste your money on this. My travel memos were very important to me, and it's taken considerable effort to avoid swearing up a storm in this review."},{"rating":"2","title":"used on my 30g ipod","review":"worked on my 5th gen ipod classic, when the harddrive took a poop i upgraded to a 120g 6th gen and it would record, i assume it only is compatible with the 5th gens"},{"rating":"1","title":"I've experienced why it was discontinued...","review":"Initially when I found this item I was so excited that it was so much cheaper and simpler than any other iPod recording device that I ordered it before reading the reviews. Immediately after ordering it I went to close the window and noticed the reviews which highly suggested it would not meet my needs and had significant issues. Within a hour of my order being placed, Amazon would not permit cancellation. I wrote the seller who did not respond until after he'd shipped it. Item arrived the following day and was placed in my mailbox so that I wasn't able to refuse shipment as the seller requested. For the price I figured I'd chance it and see if it just might fit my needs. Unfortunately its junk. After about the third use, it developed a horrible noise during playback of any new recordings. I laughed and told myself.....you get what you pay for!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Optimism quashed","review":"I bought this device hoping to use my new 5th gen ipod video as a digital recorder for class lectures but felt it did not meet my expectations. The Apple genius person told me, after making \\"voice memos\\" that were not able to be transferred to the computer and were part dead air, that memos could not be recorded longer than 20 minutes or the file would start to corrupt. So I began to stop the recordings at or before 20 minutes and I still had problems with about 30% of the files being partly corrupted and most unable to be transferred to my computer. My second trip to the genius bar was met with rebuff and advice to buy a real digital recorder and just use my iPod for music. I try to be a good apple customer....but its so hard sometimes.... I was also directed to the ExtremeMac company. I'll enquire there too...but not with much optimism. I think the advice I got today is best...buy a recorder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible hiss","review":"I have just received this and didn't think the hiss people have mentioned would be that bad but it is simply awful!

Worth it!","review":"I bought this album my first day visiting Bahia, Brasil (hopefully won't be my last; I loved it!) and I'm glad I did. It is catchy and because it is a compilation, you get to hear different artists' styles, and determine what you like. It is in portuguese, so if you don't speak it, but being able to understand what they are saying is important to you, this album is NOT for you. You can hear the black american influence, but it is not just a copy of american hip hop w/portuguese lyrics. There is some brazil flava to it. Try it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I would not read this book to my child","review":"This modification of the classic tale of the ugly frog turned into a handsome prince lacks the charm of the original tale. It is true that the frog is eventually turned into a handsome prince by the actions of a princess and they live happily ever after. However, the princess made a promise to the frog when he retrieved her golden ball and she had to be commanded to keep that promise. In a fit of frustration she hurls the frog against the wall and it is this action that turns him into a prince.In my opinion, this renders the story inappropriate for children. They are so impressionable that it is not out of the realm of possibility that some child may try the same thing. Also, the princess is a mean person, refusing to even thank the frog for retrieving her golden ball. I would not read this book to my child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful - a review of Edith Tarcov's Frog Prince","review":"I was looking for the classic tale of Frog meets Princess and mistakenly picked up this book. Dreadful.First, although we have liked James Marshall's artwork elsewhere, there's nothing special here. The drawings are simple and generally uninspired.Second. Who thought a rewrite with the princess slamming the frog against the wall was a good idea?!? Not us. In fact, my husband nixed the idea of reading this to our small children after he gave it a preliminary perusal.From the book:That made the princess veryangry.She picked up the frog, andshe threw him against the wall!But when he fell to thefloor; the frog was no longera frog.Note that there is no explanation of why this outburst led to the witches spell being broken. [Perhaps we should slam each other around to see if there's a prince or princess hiding within--lol]Two Stars. So-so art. Not true to the original tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst child book I have ever read","review":"How does a prince propose marriage to a nasty princess who throws him against the wall after enduring her abuse from the very moment they met, is beyond my comprehension. Why does the princess accepts this offer after so much repulsion toward the frog can only be explained by the prince's new looks after the spell is broken. This book teaches children that beauty is better than values or character and that violence is the solution to problems. I am surprised Scholastic is even publishing this book. Stay away from this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Reward for bad behavior","review":"My first-grader brought this book home from school. I was appalled at the story, as the moral of the story seemed to be that you get rewarded for being mean and shallow. From the other reviewers, you probably read what the plot is. I was very disturbed by the fact that the princess mistreated the frog because he was unattractive, but marries him as soon as she throws him against the wall and he magically transforms into a prince. This is a terrible message for young children, telling them that someone is only worthy if they are either attractive or is a prince. Don't buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"for professional flautists only","review":"I am too used to Galway and that group of more popular classical artists, so this cd is much over my head. it is not the composers who make this Cd too esoteric; Debussy, Ravel,Satie wrote beautiful music .but unless you area musician yourself ,you will find this much too intellectual,A great gifty for your musician friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a shame","review":"It's a shame that this is one of the few recordings of the Liebermann Sonata available. Katherine Kemler's rendition of the Muczynski sonata isn't too bad, but her Liebermann has some serious problems with it. Wrong notes are abundant, and the execution of the piece is just very sloppy in general (particularly in the second movement). I'm not particulary impressed with her use of vibrato or choice of phrasing either, although perhaps this is a matter of taste. But in an edited recording there's really no excuse for so many blatant errors. The Liebermann Sonata is a good piece, and it deserves better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm...","review":"The most offensive thing about this CD is not the stiffness of the performances or that the music never takes flight, but the blatant disregard for the score. The most egregious example is the Liebermann Sonata, in which both musicians change notes to accomodate their whim, and the pianist even re-composes the last climactic note in the second movement, dropping the left hand to a \\"B\\" from the written D#. I have no doubt that these musicians are capable of better and perhaps this recording was created under difficult circumstances of which I'm not aware. Alas, humility should be one's guide in creating a recording; not only in respect to the composer, but in shaping one's own legacy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this music","review":"I like all types of music - country, classical, rock, oldies, experimental, Chinese music, African music, etc. Peter Mathers' music I happened to pick up as a tape years ago. I played it in my car over and over again because I liked it so much - I do that, get hooked on certain music. This fellow seems to be unknown here in the U.S. No-one has written a review of this CD. All I can say is \\"I love it\\", I can't say why. His style is called 'flamenco' but I don't really associate it with other flamenco music.

If I already had a copy of Mirage, I would have known that it was wrong, but since I did not have one, it didn't occur to me that Amazon's listing would be wrong.

It begins with content very similar to the CIA world fact book entry for Turkey and proceeds to give approximate english alphabet pronounciations of Turkish rather than explaining the pronounciation and rules of Turkish. These rules are few, vital, and can be explained in a couple of pages as other books do.

It's good, but not as good. I don't think this album had the hard-driving phychadellic surf sound as in 'Viva!..' Hornet's Nest and Tempest are the best 2 tracks (and the most Los Straitjacket-esque) on the album. But I like how people are commenting on Jim Lester's drumming! He's great, and a major influence on me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"I love this band and their first two albums, but this one is a major disappointment. The mix sounds muddy. And too many of the songs try to be humorous but cross that fine line into cheesy-ness. Case in point -- \\"All that Glitters\\". Stick with the first two albums and see 'em live, but save your money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, soaring surf music -- with one amazing cover","review":"While everything on this album is top-drawer surf music, the song that, deservedly, gives people whiplash when walking by your cubicle is their cover of \\"My Heart Will Go On,\\" the theme from \\"Titanic.\\" Not changed, not transformed, simply filtered through the surf music stylings of Los Straitjackets, it becomes truly a classic surf tune and one guaranteed to make casual listeners stop, trying to figure out where they know the song from.The cover nicely encapsulates both the humor and artistry of Los Straitjackets, who manage to produce classic surf music without sounding like they're simply emulating Dick Dale or the Ventures and without straying into other forms in order to find a way to inject new life into the music.A great album for surf music fans of all ages. Strongly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cold and calculating","review":"I would've appreciated this book so much more if Carolyn came across as a candid, warm person with a sense of humor. Instead it seems as though she's an automaton whose entire life is her work. She even refers to her family as the \\"Kepcher Organization\\" and calls her parents \\"team captains.\\" Agh!But what truly annoyed me about this book is how she fell all over herself gushing about Trump, yet went out of her way to badmouth each of her prior bosses. Not a chapter goes by when she doesn't make a point of flattering Donald Trump in some way -which, I suppose, is to be expected - although it didn't help her authenticity in any way.In the end, I wish she came across as a real person with real life lessons. Her advice didn't ring true to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suitable for fresh employees","review":"I was disappointed with this book after reading all the rave reviews others had submitted.

But overall straight forward and informative book. I would recommend this book to ambitious women who want to know more about a successful leadership."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your money","review":"I was really disappointed with this book for two reasons: 1) Carolyn praised Donald Trump throughout the entire book (I understand that she is very grateful for working for Mr. Trump but she comes off more like a starry-eyed love sick puppy. 2) She really did not provide any real business tips beside those that are pretty much common sense.This book was not worth the money if she writes another book I will make sure I check it out from the library first before spending anymore money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Quick Read","review":"I wish Carolyn had addressed her snarky tone with Apprentice candidates. From another manager, it's an abuse of power. I don't agree with Carolyn's advocacy of outsourced parenthood. What's the point? But I was pleasantly surprised by the content of her book. It was likely written by her, given the errors in grammar and content organization. But it is very open about office politics, a topic rarely discussed so openly and personally. And her advice on how individuals need to position themselves relative to employers to promote success is spot on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workforce intro","review":"The title to this book is very succinct in explaining its content. Carolyn Kepcher's account of her rise to the top includes very basic business tips for anyone who's embarking on their careers, climbing the corporate ladder, or new to their executive role. The beginning of Carolyn 101 was great; Carolyn gives insight into what it took for her to achieve her career goals as a young woman and carry on her executive duties after having two children. She discusses tips for how to ace an interview, ask for raises & promotions, becoming a good manager and the importance of a team enviornment. All of this was wonderful but the book starts its decline as Carolyn finishes the book by talking about experiences from the Apprentice & I believve the last few chapters used the Apprentice as a crutch to make the book longer. Overall though, it's a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"The worst business book I've ever read. All style and no substance.

But after 2 weeks, it seized up during a recording.I tried Go Video the DVD+RW it came with (TDK) & Fijifilm DVD+RWs. I used it to copy VHS. The recording was horribly pixilated 30% in corners or even the whole screen & there was many times the sound went out with horrible squeaking using even SP speed.

Cluttered buttons and you really have to be very close to the main unit for the remote to work.Also the unit doesn't work with most of the DVD brands on the market, you may see what brands are compatible on their website.The bottomline is,D O N O T S P E N D M O N E Y O N T H I S U N I T..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!!!

The only way to unfreeze it was to unplug the unit. When you do this, you lose everything you previously recorded. I returned the unit and got a replacement (refurbished unit I found out later). After a week, the same thing happened again. I returned and received 2 more units. The last unit I asked for a brand new one, but who knows if it really was. Even this one did the same thing. I can't tell you how much material I have permanently lost because of this recorder. Stay away from this unit and anything else GoVideo puts out there or you'll be sorry.

The roadtrip is powerful in the sense that it blocks out whatever radio signal you have on and you can play your music, the mmr-60 is very weak and for it to do the job you have find a good spot in your car and somehow keep it there, but still the sound quality is pretty bad.

No kidding.In the car it's even worse, since my car antenna is external the only way I can get it to work at all is BY TOUCHING THE CAR ANTENNA WITH IT. And even then I STILL GET STATIC.It's unbelievable that a company with a reputation such as Sony's would release such a useless piece of equipment, but there you have it.

It would barely work in my car (too many radio stations available) it would work so-so in my house, although the ten meter range it supposedly has is laughable, the only way it would work in my house was to lean it up against the receiver.That is why I returned it to Amazon.All in all I would stay away from this unless you are in an area that has next to no FM stations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money unless you planned to use it outside the city","review":"This thing works good but only very close to the receiver, and don't even try to use it in the car unless you can make it levitate just above the radio, it won't work even from the passenger seat.

So, I decided to take a chance on it, just to see what my experience would be.The MMR-60 is worthless -- the signal was so weak as to be, well, unlistenable.I spent an hour or so trying different radio settings and finally decided it wasa lost cause.Save yourself some money and time, don't bother with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty cool","review":"I was a little skeptical about buying the transmitter after reading some of the reviews, but I took a chance. And I'm glad I did. I haven't had much issues with it except that the range is about less than one foot from the radio I use to listen through. But that's okay because I just sit it right on top of the radio and have clear music coming out. People that come into my office don't even realize that the music is from another source. They are always amazed to find out it's from my phone. I would buy it again if need be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, it's bad...","review":"I had to find out for myself and I am not disappointed because I expected it to be bad. I will be returning it.To make it worse, there is no connection at the bottom to plug in the charger as the picture shows.

It is a really great concept."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sony Ericsson FM Music Transmitter MMR-60","review":"This product did not work well.

Don't waste your time.It does work, but it has to be right near the radio source, but even then it gives you static. On top of that, it uses alot of power from your phone battery. Great idea, but Sony needs to go back to the drawing board on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works, but should be much better","review":"Many of the negative comments about the MMR-60 FM Transmitter are valid points. However, understanding its limitations will help to mitigate some of them. Here are some tips to get passable sound.(1) Place the transmitter in a location as close to the receiver's antenna as possible and with as few obstructions as possible. (2) Choose an unused frequency that is between two other unused frequencies. (3) Turn the volume of the phone all the way up and set the equalizer to flat.I mainly use mine in the car and the best locations I've found is on the sun visor or propped up in the center console (my antenna is printed on the back window). Keep in mind that orientation also plays a factor in the signal strength, so if the signal is weak, try moving the transmitter around slightly. The sound may not be the best, but if your radio doesn't have an input jack like mine, the options are extremely limited."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money!","review":"It does not work as advertised.

Inspite of reading all the reviews, I bought this to give it a chance. Here is the real picture.Works great if you place it above the FM radio at home. For the car, it cannot transmit signal within a foot and even if you place it close, the static that builds up is simply annoying. I almost tuned all the available frequencies. So, people who read the reviews, do not buy even to give a chance. Dont get attracted by the look.

The stock elements of Arthurian legend--the enchanted castles, the abducted princesses, the contests with mysterious knights--are revealed to have a coherent esoteric meaning.As Loomis writes, to understand the relationship between the familiar tales of Camelot and the wilder Irish myths \\"is to open suddenly the mountainsides into the glittering palaces of the Sidhe\\"--the home of the Celtic gods.The brilliance of Roger Loomis--who wrote in the 1920s--is that while he draws the same kind of fascinating connections as Robert Graves, Loomis does so through careful argument and documentation.

I would liked to have seen a few twists in the plot. Sometimes the bad people seem to repeat the same scenario over and over and although you don't know who they are until the very end, you never really seem to feel much of anything for them. The villian should be easily dispised or blow you away with the realization that they are some one entirely different than you expected. This one did not do either for me. Nevertheless, the climax near the end was extremely suspenseful, filled with action and emotions. I really did enjoy this book and would recommend it.

Logan McCord is a wonderfully scarred and tortured hero. His kidnapping experience seems to have scarred him permanatly, such as his distaste of kissing. Kelly Taylor is a wonderful young woman and neither Logan or Kelly seem to quite understand the other. There are some misunderstandings between the two. There are many questions the reader may form at the beginning of this book such as...Who kidnapped Logan? What were their reasons? Maybe the kidnapper is closer to home than anyone thinks. Why does Logan barely remember his first five years before his kidnapping? Why does he look so much like his \\"adoptive\\" father? Why do his supposed siblings resent his return? Don't worry.

They sing every hit song from the seventies era that I remember like \\"Joy To The World\\", \\"Liar\\", \\"Eli's Coming\\", \\"Mama Told Me Not To Come\\" and \\"Just An Old Fashioned Love Song\\". Which these are my favorite tunes and I recommend this CD even though if your 3 dog night fan you'll enjoy listening to this one.

You can barely hear the guitar track on \\"Mama Told Me\\" -- that problem alone made the whole purchase worthless for me. This was one fun, playful rock band with jazz and soul influences. They were very popular in the late 60s early 70s, and the music is awesome for nostalgia (and for the occasional party). If you don't like pop, that's one thing, but assuming you already like the music, don't get this version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious","review":"This CD is one of the finest CD's I have ever purchased.

I highly recommend this CD. The songs on this CD are timeless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Enough Here","review":"An improvement over an earlier \\"Greatest Hits\\" compilation, this CD still falls short, and fans should invest in the more thorough collection, \\"Celebrate,\\" which also includes great liner notes from the band members.

I mean, I watched the film, I understood roughly what it was about, but I could not write a synopsis. I think the main reason I struggled to do this, is because the film tries to do too much in such a short space of time. We are literally thrown into the midst of several character's stories, and then expected to sift through it all as we draw towards the conclusion. The fact that we are told very little about each of the characters we meet, makes this process all the more difficult.Although this is a very impressive looking and well-acted independent film (shot for $750,000), I think that in the end it would have benefited from tightening its focus more on the central characters involved in the bomb plot, and examining their motives for executing this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fatwa!","review":"You sent me the wrong move!

The cabby/terrorist is really a backdrop to the major scenes but brilliantly done. You actually have to believe these people really exist. The girlie and sex segments are probably the worst I've seen in contemporary cinema. The gore is too much and too long.

The other day, I was at Target and saw the new video for \\"Almost Perfect\\" and I had forgotten for a second who the band was,but I knew it was a cd I wanted to get. The group has a sense of desire to create good music and the tunes they come up with are so catchy and easy to get hooked on.What I love about the song \\"Will I ever make it home\\" is how you can interpret it to mean whatever you want it to be. And you can really hear the emotion and genuine expression in the vocals and that's what is missing a lot with modern music. You hear a lot of lyrics that are supposedly deep or emo lyrics that say \\"tear my heart open and sew it back shut\\" but it's almost insincere to sing words like that by shouting. This album by Ingram Hill is truly a lovely album and I hope their popularity picks up! =D"},{"rating":"2","title":"very good, nice balance","review":"This is a good album, particularly for people who like alternative/rock music that's not too heavy but not too slow. You can listen to the album while doing pretty much anything; once again, it's not really too slow or too fast. And it's not screamy, if that bothers you. Just some good alternative music. The guy's voice isn't gravelly either; I know that can be annoying. So all in all, a good buy, particularly if you don't really know what you want but just need some good music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ingram Hill's June's Picture Show","review":"I bought this cd at an Ingram Hill concert. I went to the concert just because I liked their one song Almost Perfect which I had heard on the radio. I had such a great time at the concert and really liked their music so I decided to buy the cd which is a decision I don't regret especially since I got it autographed, but the music is genuinly good. It is a mix between rock and a little pop and I would say it is a softer rock. The songs have meanings behind them and you can actually relate to them. Ingram Hill also plays all their own instruments and they write their own songs. If you have heard either of their hit songs on the radio and liked them you will truly enjoy the whole cd. It is something the whole family can listen to and enjoy also.<a href=http://ingramhill.onthestreets.net/taf.php?ref=1&uid;=15220>Join the Ingram Hill Street Team!</a>"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleasant surprise","review":"I discovered Ingram Hill on a local modern rock station a few months ago. Since I liked two of their songs I decided to get the CD. It was definitely a great purchase. Their songs are really catchy and have good lyrics. The kinds of songs you have spinning around in your head hours later. I also like that they try out different styles and sometimes catch me by surprise with what they do. Give them a listen to see what I mean.It is hard to pick standout tracks considering the fact that I really do like them all. But the most memorable ones for me are: Almost Perfect, On My Way, Will I Ever Make It Home, What If I'm Right, Maybe It's Me.If you are finding the music currently on the radio to be stale and uninspiring, I recommend giving this a listen. This may best be described as rock with an emotional side. I simply call it a breath of fresh air."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!","review":"Like many people, I saw Ingram Hill open for Hanson and I thought they were awesome. They are very good live. That was last summer, and this week I finally got around to buying the CD. Plainly, Ingram Hill rocks! They are definitely one of the better rock bands out there today. Many of their songs were easily stuck in my head only after one or two listens. My favorites are \\"Never Be The Same\\", \\"What If I'm Right\\", \\"Hanging Around Again\\", and \\"Slippin' Out\\".

Their music, while accessable and groove-laden, at the same time had complexity to it. Brian Felix, the keyboard player, often uses various effects to manipulate the sound of his instrument - in essence, quickly sampling himself. Ilya Stemkovsky stays in the pocket most of the time, dropping a handful of fills on the album, but when he does, they're huge. Pete Novembre follows a similar path. But to think of the band as a group of three individuals is the wrong way to go about it. Om trio's greatest achievement is that they sound like one unit, whereas often times trios like Medeski Martin and Wood sound like three guys trying to impress each other. The Om trio isn't trying to impress anyone; they're just trying to make good music, and they most definatly succeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE of TECH FOR LESS!!!!!","review":"I ordered one of these Tvs for my Niece from Tech for Less.

They are all good for some different reasons, and for some same ones. Mellow Gold is great because it seems to catch Beck at one of his artistic pinnacles: during a collaboration of musical opposites into one (a)tonal smorgasbord. Beck's genius lies in his ability to incorporate all of the best qualities of varying musical forms into a balladry-reinforced, techno-hip-hop pudding. Mellow Gold is a fine example of how a healthy dose of anti-poetry and lack of concern can make music seem so pure. \\"How you like me now?\\" I sez: \\"Pretty good.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Clean.","review":"A decent album with pros and cons. This version takes out a few of the curse words Beck was known for using in his earlier pre-Odelay days. A fun album, lots of different styles, probably his most diverse album from 'Golden Feelings' and 'Western Harvest' to 'Sea Change'. Includes 'Loser,' one of the few songs that changed much of pop music in the nineties being one of the first to mix the pop formula with hip-hop (just about any big pop star in the nineties was either influenced by this song or by the post-grunge movement or both). The clean version isn't better or worse to the listener, just cleaner.

Maybe, but it wouldn't be the same. The songwriting is good. As it is on Sea Change. But this adds excitement not sadness. Beck is famous for recreating genres into his own thing. This remakes Blues, some folk, a little bit of funk and may bits of classic rock.

I was listening to this cd with a friend on the way up to the mountains and we couldn't make it past track 5. Of the 2,000 or so cds I have spun there are three that I couldn't make myself finish. This is one of them.That was 2008. So I waited till now to give it one more chance. I was able to finish it but Dear God the last half of the record is unlistenable. The only song worth anything is the opener novelty cut \\"Loser\\". With zillions of cds to choose from this is dragging the bottom. The cd made #10 on the 1994 Pazz and Jop poll.

If you want to, go ahead and remove the Radio classic \\"Loser\\" altogether from the track listing and you still have a great Album. If your looking for unique songs to add to that perfect mix CD, this album is packed with Nuggets & Doozies such as \\"Pay No Mind\\", \\"Wiskeyclone\\", \\"Truck Drivin Neighbors Downstars\\"...that will blow listeners away and make her/him fall in love with you...Why do you ask?

I had the pleasure of rereading \\"These Happy Golden Years\\" recently, and even now, a married woman myself, the book still exhilerates me and captures my imagination. In some children's series, it is sad to see the heroine grow into a woman, but in Laura's case, her stories become even more interesting as she crosses the bridge from youth to adulthood. She and Almanzo were a strong and exceptional couple whose courtship should be an inspiration to everyone. I'm glad that, if the series had to end, Ms. Wilder ended it on such a satisfying note."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent book","review":"Love the whole series.

I have had a notify request in to Amazon/ToolCrib for over a year, never got any information, and they long ago seem to have removed the carbide blade item from the site. This unit NEEDS carbide blades for the planer. Without them, the unit is relatively useless on anything harder than fresh yellow pine. Old wood, ash, oak and the like require carbide or this machine simply folds the edge of the steel knives. while they can be resharpened, they are relatively useless compared to carbide blades. The planer is great, the steel blades are a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review","review":"These are good quality blades.

The blades are easy to resharpen, and can be removed and reinstalled with little hassle. I have been very pleased with the HSS, though I have never tried carbide in this planer.For those of you who want carbide blades, I have seen them come up on eBay on occasion (new in box) for about $400-500.

All of the ideas to use for Charades were made up for those who lived in the 1950's. All of the movies and songs were so old that there would have been absolutely no way my child/teen could know. It needs to be updated. Also, I paid extra for faster shipping to be on my doorstep the day of the party for my daughter's 17th B-Day. I gave Amazon 2 days...and it landed the day after. Don't trust the shipping unless you do know for sure it's going to arrive in one day.

However, I LIKE that about this game. With current movies, books, etc., the game tends to be too easy.

I wanted to get a CD so that I could choose random and repeat and queitly veg and meditate or sleep.At first when I received the CD I was disappointed to see the note on the back that there were vocals. The Water Spirit is solely instrumental. But I popped it in the CD player and Kim has a beautiful, haunting voice that blends well with the instruments.

The albums are \\"A Grande Revelacao\\" (1963), \\"Que Queres Tu De Mim?\\" (1964) and \\"Sentimental Demais\\" (1965). Dutra was a throwback to the pre-bossa \\"radio singers\\" era, when the bolero style that dominated the rest of Latin America made its way into the Brazilian mainstream. Probably too corny for most listeners, but if you do get on this wavelength, this is ripe, rich, fun stuff.(This box set came out in 2002 on EMI-Brazil.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Review from a Deaf reader","review":"I noticed that while reading the other reviews, they were all people who had read this author before or love baseball. I am writing this review from the view of a Deaf person. In the first chapter, the author opens up with a scene at a Deaf school. For those of you who don't know, the Deaf school is a sense of pride in the Deaf community and the author seemed to have an awareness of that. Luther \\"Dummy\\" Tayler (all players who were Deaf back in the early 1900s were called \\"Dummy\\" - so don't take offense) used different means of communication throughout the book. He always seemed more comfortable with those who signed. His wife is Deaf, which is another culture instance within the Deaf community - marrying other Deaf people due to communication issues. This book also shows that Deaf people are actually quite smart (which is opposite the nickname, \\"Dummy\\"). This book was not written by a Deaf author, but he was well-informed and it is worth reading! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Aye Yie Yie!","review":"I would give this book five stars if it weren't for the level of difficulty in reading it...just had to take off a star for that reason alone. This isn't the book for the first time dog owner or casual trainer. It's a serious book for the well-versed student of dog behavior and training. Mr. Lindsay definitely knows what he's talking about but the reader must already have a fairly good grasp of the \\"concepts\\" behind his explanations in order to fully understand the material. It was a good read that I had trouble putting down, though! If you're serious about learning the more advanced concepts and principles in dog behavior and training, the book is well laid out and informative to the max!"},{"rating":"2","title":"well worth the time and money!","review":"This book along with volume one are the most in depth and useful books on dogs, their behavior and training. A 'must read' for those who work with dogs and very useful for the owner who wants to know dogs better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Dog Trainers/Behaviorists","review":"This book is well written, organized and supported with reliable sources. Definitely written at a collegiate level. The author spends a lot of time (3 chapters) talking about the different types of aggression dogs display since aggression is the number 1 reason people hire a trainer. There are also chapters on excessive and compulsive behaviors, fears and phobias, elimination problems, basically all the issues that are the reason to hire trainers. He also includes a very specific form that he finds helpful to collect information from dog owners to get background information before training and before the first in-house meeting session with clients. This is a form that I will model my own after as it includes everything you can think of that can relate to a behavior issue. This book should be on every dog trainer's shelf and in use. I'm excited to read the next and to have the complete series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing pieces","review":"did not ship with all that was needed.

All make for good reading for the traveling birder, and are especially good during the very earliest phase of trip planning - ie, choosing a destination. Considering the scope of the book, it is understandably brief and shallow, which is its greatest shortcoming. I could envision the next edition doubling in girth, and still omitting a lot! The segment on Mexico is particularly skimpy - whole regions, rich with endemic birds, are left out - such as the Acapulco/Guerrero region. On the other hand, the Lesser Antilles are treated a bit more completely. But, this book (and the series) is really the first of its kind, and every serious or casual neotropical birder will benefit from reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best guide","review":"I used this book while in Africa, and discovered that Africans were using a guide to the mammals of Africa that is better organized and easier to use.

At page 131 it seemed like nothing had happened in a few dozen pages except a lot of sailing (it takes place on a boat going north from Florida to New York using guess what...an inland passage) and a lot of almost teen-like relationships, with a lot of drinking thrown in. I'll have to leave the cruise in mid-stream."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another flick from the bargin bin.","review":"Made-for-TV thriller that is more predictable than thrilling.Lynn is an office-clerk with a mysterious past and a tall stranger following her. The last thing she needs is to have an armed robber tell her the location of 2 million dollars in loot before he commits suicide. The other crooks involved are convinced that Lynn knows where the money is while the police know she was listening to loud music on her headphones and couldn't here a word.As luck would have it an embittered cop is designated to be her protector and after a few rolls in the sheets he finds out Lynn's ability to read lips (incredible co-incidence isn't it?). So plots and betrayals spring up on all sides and you never know who you can trust with two million on the loose.You average TV movie. The most redeeming feature about the DVD is that there are no commercials. But I suppose that there are enough \\"Family Ties\\" fans out there to keep this one on the shelves for a while"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eyes of a stranger","review":"I actually only bought this dvd because Im a huge Macgyver fan.

Bascially Macgyver has to babysit justine bateman and starts to fall in love with her, and he gets shot in the process, movie over.It's plot is pretty typical and boring, I was expecting Dana Elcar to pop up and pull Mac outta a jam... but was disapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best!","review":"This is one of those albums where every single song is fantastic. The overall cadence of the album is perfect for making dinner! - starts of with great boogie tunes and then moves to more mellow numbers.

This CD makes a great gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT COMPARABLE TO PINK MARTINI","review":"I purchased this CD based on the reviews - \\"if you like Pink Martini...\\" I love Pink Martini, I love Latin music, but I dont love this. The instumentals are great, if only you could separate the ridiculously stupid lyrics. One review compared Pepe to Ricky Ricardo - true but more aptly a bad attempt at satire, reminiscent of an SNL sketch. I only wish I purchased this at Tower or Virgin so I could return it - I cant think of anyone to give it to. It's so bad I'd be embassased to be associated with it. To each their own. People are entitled to their opinion and to love this CD. However, dont compare it to another band knowing that people will rely on your comments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funtimes on a CD","review":"Aight, if you are looking for interesting and fun music with a distictive Latin flair then this is the one to get. The music has the ability to make any room start jumping. If you love to dance to Latin music you are in heaven. But beyond that the song selection shows the diversity and breadth of the musicians. One of the most fun (there's that word again)songs is Number 4. It sounds like an old-style swing song, except for the fact that the lead vocalist is singing in Chinese...really really cool. There is also a really cool version of Sing Sing Sing. My personal favorite is Rumba de 5 Kilos. If you enjoyed the music of Pink Martini then this cd is a must buy, the same quality but much more danceable. And if you really like this cd then you should pick up Sympathique by Pink Martini (another group put together with Pepe Raphael)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wild, rowdy but charming, relentless fun!","review":"What a trip! Mad, bizarre, outrageous paired up with melodic, rhythmical, and enchanting. I'd classify their style as mellifluous hodgepodge. Bold improvisations on some familiar tunes and themes, plus plenty of inventive and original variations. Incredibly catchy, swirling, jiving music and lyrics. Nothing is held back, totally unrestrained. The CD starts out with terribly energetic tracks, mellows out a bit in the middle, and wraps it all effortlessly at the end. \\"Latenight Betty\\" is nothing short of a fiery, feisty, cathartic listening experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"I want more Pepe & the Bottle Blondes!","review":"I grew up a third-generation Spanish American and was thusly exposed to a lot of different types of Latin music and I love it all. Lately though, I've been looking for something a little off the mark, something different. I wanted an album that was good for a big party, but nice enough to play at a dinner party.I somehow stumbled upon Pepe & the Bottle Blondes and it hasn't left my CD player since the day I bought it!The depth of Pepe's voice and those of the Bottle Blondes as well is astounding and moving in a way, especially on \\"El V��ls De Tom��s\\" (my favorite song on the album.)If you're a big fan of salsa, latin jazz, anything with a good beat, you'll really appreciate this album. I can't really define any one word to describe their sound, all I can say is that they make beautiful music. I can't wait to hear more from Pepe & the Bottle Blondes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Production","review":"The quality of the production blew me away! I play the CD loud and often.

In more than one way Dagerman echos the french existentialists, notably Albert Camus (The Fall).As American film noir of the 1950s expressesed the pent-up depression of the 1930s and the post-war confusion of the 1950s in the US, so Dagerman's work appears to confront a country forced into change by external forces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Purchased a pair only received one lamp shade","review":"Purchased a pair only received one lamp shade.

The book seems to be a bit more focused on the details of adobe brick making which is great if that is what you want. The rammed earth sections are very informative but lack some of the construction details. I would have liked to have seen more detailed decriptions with better drawings of forms, for example. The author also has several table having containg soil composition that was a bit too technical for practical use.

Additional books would be needed to learn enough to build one yourself though."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to Build Your Own Adobe Home","review":"This book is for the individual who wants to and is able to build his/her own home.

Depending on you closet size and which lay out you decide on, you may have to cut some of the boards. Luckily, we own one of those portable rotating skill saw things and had no problem with this.

We ordered 2 of these and both came in relatively unscathed boxes via UPS, but when we opened them, one had a dent in one of the racks.

With the exception of Black Betty and a \\"def-stupid\\" remake of \\"I Who Have Nothing\\", there is not much to recommend on this album. A pitty.What makes it even worse is that the CD is created with \\"copy control technology\\". This means that you cannot rip the CD and load it on your MP3 player.

A great album, some very hip grooves here. And also some darker ballads, that appropriately tie the whole album together. The liner notes say that the whole shabang was recorded live with only a few overdubbs. I think music sounds better this way - in its element. I have seen these boys live, and although better live(as most music is and should be) the ablum is true to their sound.

I wasn't sure what to expect since I am such an avid fan of Rostova's Black Lace series, but this book delivered as fantastically as her others. It is a historical novel of the British in India, telling the story of a British woman who experiences a number of....well, experiences!One of the main reasons i like Rostova's novels is that she creates fully 3-dimensional characters, both male and female. The men are not reduced to dogs, the women not to vapid airheads. Admittedly, I didn't find the male character Gerald (Devora's husband) as interesting as the male characters in the Black Lace books, but he holds his own. The excellent writing and the story are vintage Rostova. Now if she would only hurry up and write another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot and Spicy!","review":"I really enjoyed this book!

I thought this was a well written story and a great twist on the colonial, cross-cultural theme. Devora is a strong, independent woman who both battles and understands the restrictions of colonial society. Rohan is a perfect foil to her with his stoically sexy attitude and also to the very British husband Gerald. Their relationship together fuses cultures and sexuality with some very hot love scenes. The other characters balance the story nicely -- a great \\"variation on a theme\\" of colonial erotica!"},{"rating":"1","title":"very lame","review":"If this is all Ms. Roy/Rostova could come up with given the immense possibilities of an Indian setting, with maharajas and civil lines lives of Memsahibs....I am very disappointed. The book has gratuituos sex scenes which do not contribute to the story in any way. Its also wildly derivative in the worst way - the protagonist is an English Memsahib of the Raj, who thinks and acts like an American woman from the 1990s. Stereotypes and cliches are scattered on each and every page, and the author has very little imagination when it comes to sex. on the whole, i suggest avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"An OST Which Completely Lacks Originality","review":"I saw the Movie, and I loved the original composition which was present in many of the emotional scenes. Throughout the film, they'd use small snippets of popular songs, which were appropriate for the movie (Ace of Spaces, etc).This OST took advantage of those snippets, and crammed these age-old tunes onto a CD and marketed them. Why in God's name would you pay $30+ dollars for an Audio CD with a random assortment of old music?The original Orchestra composition present (Clint Mansell) in the film is almost entirely absent from this disk, comprising only TWO of the tracks on set-list.The end scene had an especially moving and invigorating orchestra piece, which was not included in this soundtrack.

The digital version does not allow you to print out the hikes you may want to take - making the digital version completely useless unless you intend on taking your laptop along on the hike. While I can understand that the authors don't want you to print out the book and sell it, by not allowing printing of the hikes you'd like to take you must either memorize the details or buy another book so you don't go off track (or trail as the case may be). Buy the book, preferrably at the park. Yes I know the trails are well marked and all you really need is the information for the trail head, but it would have been really nice to take the 2 or 3 pages of the information along (without the whole book) - which would have made this book really useful instead of a novelty for ebook geeks.

In \\"13\\", her brilliantly witty first novel, Zeitoun tells the story of Marnie, a precocious teen who doesn't fit in with the bland, drab suburban life, either at home or at school. Zeitoun's vivid, clever writing makes the reader see and feel the world the way Marnie does. Anyone who has ever been 13, or felt out of step in high school (or at any point in his/her life), will read this book with a sense of recognition and delight that someone has finally been able to express what s/he thought in those days. A remarkable, confident first novel by a fresh, new voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learning ArcGIS programming","review":"This book provides an excellent introduction to programming ArcObjects with VB. I had very little programming experience, but found the book explained the subjects very well. The exercises were easy to follow and quickly allowed me to pick up most of the basic principles. The book is well laid out allowing you to work through the sections that you are most interested in whether that be customising the user interface, working with macro's or programming an application with Visual Basic. The mix of theory, examples and excerises is well thought out, giving a balanced book that is easy to read.

Lyle Alzado(RIP) stars as a demented convict who is left locked up in MSP after the prison has closed down. When a low budjet film crew decides to shoot a \\"convict women\\" type movie, Lyle breaks out and all hell breaks loose. The only positive part of this movie is that Lyle has almost no lines, so you only have to deal with a dissfunctional plot. I dunno, it may become a cult classic. Its a real stinker though. It tries to be a horror movie but fails misserably when all you do is laugh at the bad production. It has some full frontal nudity, for some the only redeeming quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy Duty Planer Delivers","review":"The Hitachi P20SB 3-1/4 Heavy Duty Planer lives up to its name.

He simply calls Joseph de Maistre \\"mentally ill\\" (p.264), and don't take any of these persons serious. By reading this book, you will pass some hard time for reading a book that doesn't help you to understand the Enlightenment, nor the context.Don't spill your money for this book.

The bungee cord came undone in about two weeks, which I managed to repair. A week later, the hook holding the bag in place tore off while I was riding, sending my bag into the middle of the road and under the semi behind me. Also when using the bag as a shoulder/messenger bag, which I had to do after recovering it once the truck rolled by, the hooks that latch onto the rack dig into your back in a less than pleasant way.

The bag is a snap to install on the rack. On my first trip, my heel touched the bag a couple of times. The problem was resolved by attaching the bag back further on the rack. There are two plastic inserts that are used to hold the bag open and make it more rigid. Some clear instructions on how to use these inserts would have been good. In use, the bag is capable of holding a bunch of groceries. I love how it folds flat against the bike when not in use.My only complaint (and it's a fairly minor one, at that) is that a second handle would make carrying it easier, when off of the bike.All in all, it's a great bag. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bag!","review":"Just received this bag yesterday, used it last night to go to the store and thought it worked great!

Here are the problems. The bag gaps open allowing things to fall out. Most bags of this type have some method for tightening the sides of the bag to keep things inside. This one doesn't. There is a clasp attached at the bottom of the bag that will keep it shut completely. That's fine if you have nothing inside. But, the clasp is absolutely useless once you have anything in the bag. The last straw broke for me today when the hook that attaches the bag to the bike rack fell off.Really, do that have low IQ monkeys designing for this company? No, monkeys would probably realize that if they had to carry bananas in this bag that they would lose them.

Some examples appear to be out-side of the scope of the book.The Ecology of War reads more like a scrap book than a study with a purpose.

Beck achieved an impressive growth spurt in the four-year period represented here; wisely dropping Stewart to concede the Power Trio + Preening Big Hair Vocalist Contest to former Yardbird bandmate Jimmy Page, and moving on to explore more innovative guitar territory (which later became known as \\"fusion\\").

Thank goodness I purchased this at a discount because it is not worth the full price (actually I wouldn't want it for free it is so bad). It's cheap. It falls over easily causing my child to be annoyed. The slide falls off. Doll gets stuck in slide. The highchair is ridiculous, it's hard to get doll in and out of and falls over and off of the unit. They include a potty yet the doll can't take her pants off, so I guess she just \\"tinkles\\" through her pants. The one I got must have been defective because she never said \\"I did it\\" after going potty (even though left hand was near soap like directions say). They include a cookie and sippy cup which doesn't trigger the doll to do anything! Unlike the ones the doll comes with. So my poor daughter can't figure out what the problem is and she gets frustrated. I can't tell you how stupid this toy is!!!!! Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"This playcenter fell apart minutes after it was given to the children","review":"might be okay for a calm and careful 7 or 8 year old.

My daughter tried to enjoy this toy, but with pieces falling off she just got fed up. It has been the least played with of her toys.

The story, however, develops quite differently from the pattern of earlier volumes. For starters, the \\"mystery\\" is not a murder (several chapters run their course before there is even a disappearance). Then, as Cadfael uses his powers of observation and logic to \\"solve\\" the mystery, and his wisdom to resolve it, the author is very slow to let us in on his thinking. When she finally does, the various threads of the story are not tied together in quite so perfect a tapestry as we have come to expect; questions about how this strange series of events could have unfolded in the context of medieval monastic life linger even as the story ends with an elegaic passage about the changing seasons in the English countryside. An excellent \\"mystery,\\" indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most dissatisfying of the Brother Cadfael mysteries.","review":"Though I love Brother Cadfael, this story was most tedious and far-fetched. I couldn't believe that this young woman would do what she did for a man she hardly knew, and the conclusion drags out too long and elaborately, once you realize who she is. I've read worse books, but after the true excellence of most of the other Cadfael novels, this one was a strange, sad let-down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good service.","review":"Prompt deleivery and the used book was in very good condition. All as advertised. I am very pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the Brother Cadfael Mysteries","review":"I have to say that this is my favorite of the Chronicles. It has great characters, a riveting storyline, and the most beautiful picture of true, sacrificial love I have ever read. To say anymore would give away the ending. DO NOT skip ahead in this one or you will not get the full impact of the story. It is better to keep guessing. But read it a second time to get the details that you missed from not knowing the secret."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of an outstanding series","review":"In this moving and dramatic story,Ellis Peters succeeds in doing something I thought was impossible in a mystery - and I am a mystery writer myself. I can't tell what it is without giving away the end. All I can say is that in addition to a story that intrigues from the first scene,characters and relationships you will never forget, and a fully-realized historical setting, there is an ending that will first thrill you and then make you say, \\"How did she do that???\\" And then you will want to read it all over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eats Wood!","review":"I looked at all the planers. I was going to buy a planer with AMPS being my first concern. With a 3.4 amp motor this planer did not fail once. I put this machine to work on rough cut white oak with the blades full bore, and I got tired before this Hitachi planer. My only wish is the shoe as in all planers in this class was 1 inch longer. With a longer shoe or base this would get 5 stars. At this price you cannot go wrong. Blades are a snap to change, and sharpen. This is a nice machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining, but not very helpful","review":"This book was OK. There were some good pieces but there was so much whining in it I found myself getting terribly annoyed. I also found it to be very, very politically correct.There are some good, entertaining essays, but some of the writing is HORRIBLE. Especially the non-essays where the editors are talking about the modern world and how they work. It's just not very original. It didn't tell me anything I didn't already know.It's a great idea for a book, but it just doesn't seem representative to me. The pieces don't remind me of people I know in my twenties. Some one else could do a better job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read This Book!!!","review":"I absolutely loved this book and read it cover to cover in one sitting. Finally, a book that talked about my life. It was both affirming and inspiring. As a person in my late twenties, I have dealt with a lot of the issues regarding how to make a home, figure out relationships, and find meaningful work. It also made me want to be more socially engaged. I loved the idea of an anthology as the only way that these issues could be presented since knowledge is subjective and we learn from a variety of perspectives. In it there is something for everyone (I highly recommended it for parents of a twentysomething).

How can she still be that girl who was in living color when she is ranked as the most demanding artist out there. She calls herself down-to-earth when she thinks she is a diva. Not only are the lyrics unworthy, but the collaborations are too. I am tired of her trying to be black and trying to be Mariah by having all these rappers in her songs. The only difference is that Mariah has the voice. She is not overshadowed by the rappers.

For her latest single, Jenny From The Block, she claims she is still the same girl she was, but she was just too sarcastic in fashion with that in mind. Still, she really has to get herself away from being the Milli Vanilli of Latin Pop, and prove that she can really sing. To be honest with you, I think her beau sings better than she can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't find these locally","review":"This is a good product. I'm replacing another that lasted about 10 years. It's reasonably sturdy. The best part is that it is BLACK plastic. Locally, I can only find white and it stains and looks dirty and terrible in the sink after a short time. In terms of design, the only improvement would be to have the little pull on both sides of the screen. Sometimes it falls into the sink and the pull is on the bottom and I need to use a fork to turn it over."},{"rating":"1","title":"excellent for keeping out silverware","review":"I gave it 4 stars not because it was faulty, but because it doest fit all disposals. I had a kenmore originally, and it fit perfectly. I had to get a new disposal, a waste king 8000, and the screen was too big. I filed it and sanded it smooth to get it to fit the new hole. other than it not fitting all disposals, It works perfectly.An update, I just changed it to 1 star, the fins/ strainer has cracked in several places, not completely broke in 2 yet but any time soon the center handle is going to break out of it. Its center is too weak, if a pot or glass goes into the drain it puts stress on the strainers center. Apparently its not designed to stay in the drain and pile any dishes in it. Kind of defeats its purpose of keeping stuff from falling in the drain if you cant put anything it the sink anyway.Im currently looking for a better replacement before it breaks all together and my wife grinds up my silverware in my new disposal. save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liked it at first","review":"This was just what I wanted - a black disposer screen.

This book is an absolute revelation. It puts into perspective so well the pain I recently suffered at the loss of a very close and dear friend.The brilliant thing about this book is that Dr Buckman has been exposed to the suffering of serious illness and grief both as a Dr and as a patient. Having had leukaemia (and survived) as a young adult 30 years ago, I found every word in this book about the suffering of the 'terminally ill' (as I was told I was, so long ago) struck a familiar chord.This is one of the most comprehensive and compassionate books on death, dying, bereavement and grief available today. If you, or a friend or loved one, is supporting someone with a life-threatening illness, this book will be a tremendous support.

The result was that I took many many dumps from horses taught to fear riders. Getting into my mid 30s I started to feel all those old injuries and decided I wanted to get back into a more routine yoga practice to help. During my next trip to the tack store I found this book, and WOW it is great! It's been inspiring me to get back into the yoga and to realize how influential it has been on my riding already. I only hope they come out with a second book: Advanced Yoga for Equestrians.

It stays on the bottle until you pull it off. And I haven't opened a 750 ml bottle of wine yet that it didn't fit. The stainless-rimmed coaster is even nicer looking than the plain black one. This is an attractive utilitarian design that really works.

It serves as a reminder how hard it is for anyone to write \\"a la Schubert\\" without simply stealing themes actually by Schubert. What we have here is a motly heap of cut and pasted tidbits, borrowed from various chamber works, the Wanderer Fantasy and even Winterreise! Perhaps the worst of it is the Andante movement which brings together rip-offs from the Great C major, with what sounds like suspiciously like part of the Andante from Mendelssohn's Italian Symphony, which then grotesquely morphs into the \\"Wanderer\\" theme!

It fails in several regards. First, it is loose in the slot. I would guess there are about 0.04 (1/32) inches of play between the miter gauge bar and the slot, and there is no adjustment. Second, the pivot on the miter gauge is loose, and there is no way to tighten it. This pivot slop probably adds an additional degree or two of play in the system. I gave this two stars instead of one because for the price I don't think it is reasonable to expect much more. I only needed it for making very rough cuts, and it is good enough for that.

If the suction cups weren't made to give the caddy its structure, the whole thing wouldn't just give out when a suction cup needs to be reapplied or slides on the tile. In a recent fall, a few pieces broke off. Being that is it plastic, I guess that is to be expected. Basically, this thing was great for a temporary shelf but if you are looking for something long term, and are annoyed by having to pick your shampoos and soaps up off the shower floor every few days when it collapses over time, like myself, perhaps choose a different shower caddy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hitachi Workhorse","review":"The M12V 3-1/4 HP router is a solid piece of equipment that will do the job for many years to come. It is easy to use and comes with the accessories you will need for a variety of routing tasks. The adjusting knob is easy to use and quite accurate. The instructions are clear and easy to understand.

I have used it to mill over 150 rafter tails out of 3\\"x8\\" stock. My only complaint is that the linear bearings needed some silicone lubrication occasionally during the project. The variable speed is a plus; the large bit that I was using cut best at less than maximum speed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hitachi M12 3 1/4 HP variable speed 1/2\\" Plunge Router","review":"I recently attended a woodworking show where I saw first hand the many router bit suppliers using this router to demo their router bits. I asked them why they weren't they using Porter Cable or Dewalt routers and the typical response was this was the best router for the buck! They literaly abused this machine and it plowed right along. I did the research and this is the cheapest(dollar wise)router thats built very well. It is a little heavier than other models of the same caliber, but it was very comfortable and easy to handle. I would definitely recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"So good I bought two.","review":"The M12V is solidly the best router bang for buck. Amateurs and professionals would appreciate this tool. First off, the fit and finish were great. The first time I turned the router on I was instantly impressed with it's easy start-up which controls the torque and prevents little \\"kick-back\\" while holding the tool. The operation and performance were not disapointing either. I was so pleased with the first one, I bought a second for a dedicated router table.PROS: cost; power; performance; versatility (variable speed) included accessories; good company for support or service if neededCONS: no real dust collection built in (only resaon I didn't think it was a 5 star rating)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great router","review":"Bought this router with the idea of using it in a table exclusively. I Figured it would be too heavy for using it without a table, but I was wrong: the smooth slowstart feature and the router having no vibration makes it easily controlled.I did end up mounting it in a table and it works great with large style and rail cutters.I compared this against the larger DeWalt, but this one won based on price. As to performance, they are probably equal.If you need a larger router for a good price, get this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"tremendous BANG for the buck","review":"I purchased this router over a year ago and it has been a real workhorse. I mounted it in a router table built from a shopsmith plan and it is every bit the machine I could want. I have used everything from a 1/4 inch square bit to a 3 inch raised panel bit and it has performed flawlessly. I really like the variable speed, and the height adjustment knob works great in a router table.

Heck, I thought I had popped a breaker, or a \\"re-set,\\" or a part that could be replaced. WRONG, if THIS router \\"grunts\\" it fries the speed control module. They charge about $80 for the module! But heck, since I ALREADY have \\"modified\\" this router to use in my table, I \\"try\\" to buy the module..... GOOD LUCK! After 2 months of dealing with a \\"hitachi distributor,\\" I finally told them to stick the order and bought a Milwaukee. I \\"learned\\" a lesson, IF I find anything about half the price of all competitors, I probably should BUY TWO so that I can \\"fix\\" it when it breaks.

It is currently permanently mounted (3 years now) in my router table and will most likely stay there until its shot. I have added the router raizer kit(simple installation) to it and cannot live without this setup!This router has soft start and runs smooth and true. I use the router with a 3 1/2in raised panel bit with no problems. It has enough power to hog out all the material in one pass, but I usually take multiple to prevent blowout and a smoother finish.For the price, I am considering purchasing a spare just to have as a backup. You just can't go wrong with this one!

But it is smooth, it is powerful, it is affordable & it has a proven track record. I built my own router table with a tilt up top & made a hand crank to replace the height adjustment knob & these two things make it easy to change out & raise or lower the bits. Also stuck a couple of o-rings in the collet like a previous reviewer suggested & have never had a stuck bit. Have to clean, buff & lube the plunge rods once in a while but I see that as a non issue because any router should be periodically cleaned anyway. So for the money it costs for one of those top-of-the-line models I've got a good router & a nice table to put it in & I like that. Happy woodworking!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"High Power Low Cost","review":"At the last Anahiem WW Show I decided to get the M12V. I was some what sceptical when I seen the price deference between the other makers of comparible HP. I bought it! I have 5 routers, I use them all! I make furniture and cabinetry. I cut 30-50 raised panel doors a month using every specie of wood imaginable. Maple, Koa and Cherry giving us the hardest time with burning and splintering. The M12V has been great. The height adjustment works well- not perfect. The wood can be pushed thru fast or slow with little bog. The true test is its ability to be forgiving when coping a rail. What I really like about- its quite, it can handle my work load and it was so cheap that I can throw it away and buy another one without blinking.

It is a little large for my table (Rockler), but that isn't the fault of the router. Because of this I have removed the handles. I like the speed control. It works well with the larger bits. (I prefer 1/2 inch bits). It has plenty of power. The fine adustment knob which came with the router was very difficult to use on a router table. Finally, I gave up and I purchased a Router Razier. After getting it installed (which wasn't an easy task), it makes fine adjustments easy. The one wrench systems makes changing bits somewhat difficult. I am seriously considering purchasing another wrench and just not using the \\"sliding wrench\\" which comes on the router. All in all I am pleased with the router. The power, low noise operation, and speed control makes up for the problems I have experienced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value","review":"A \\"keep it simple\\" approach that is durable. Used in both free hand and table mounted. Find the smooth motor very easy to use and powerful. Soft start makes hand held operations easy. The simple depth post setup is accurate.

Got an M12V2 Instead","review":"I ordered an M12V, but got an M12V2 because the router I ordered is discontinued (even though there was no mention of it anywhere). Amazon/Contractors Tools/Hitachi felt that substituting a $197 router for the $324 router I paid for was OK. Luckily, I was able to find an M12V router locally. I highly recommend one if you can find it. The M12V2 is more plastic and less ruggedly built, but the price is proportional, so it may not be a bad deal. I am now dealing with the mess of getting an RMA from the manufacturer because they shipped me something I didn't order. The router I received isn't actually shown on Contractors Tools' website, and now the image for the M12V router has been replaced by some combo kit, not the actual router image shown when I ordered it. I seriously looked at a Bosch 1619evs instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another POOR Router","review":"This router was a huge disapointment. The depth adjustment was sloppy. The speed control is recessed too far in the housing and required a tool (screwdriver or dowel rod) to effect any speed change. It was impossible to change the speed with just my fingers. My son tried it and he too couldn't change the speed without an assist. I did like the heft of the machine. It felt rather stable in my hands (heavy though.) I sent it back, as I think that the speed control is either poorly designed or defective. All in all, not very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"I bought this Hitachi M12V a couple of years ago with the intention of mounting in in a table set up. I used it a time or two freehand and it was okay except the height adjustment was stiff.Finally got around to table mounting the thing this weekend and I ran into problems immediately. The fine adjustment knob that came with the machine was broken right out of the box. The overall height adjustment is somewhere between impossible and unusable.A ball peen hammer is not my idea of an adjustment tool.Machine is worthless if you can't set it up like you need it.Sorry Hitachi, you had a chance, and it also cost you a sale on a high end miter saw.Anybody have Makita's phone number?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't buy it","review":"I looked at this router and bought a Makita.

It was one helluva introduction to the router, let me tell you.I use it in a table, where it does an outstanding job. Yeah, it's really big, has a somewhat dated design, and is heavy, but let's be honest - you don't buy a 3.25HP router to do fine work, do you? No, you buy it for raising panels on the table, or cutting dados in particleboard. Barring that, you could probably use the M12V to mix concrete.This baby is built like a tank, and has little to recommend against it.

The auto-trim feature seems like a bit of a gimmick to me, but it does work. Turn the tuning key to tune the string and as you turn the key the string is trimmed, with no sharp end sticking out from the post. The feature saves a few minutes in the restringing process.The price for them is great compared to Schaller or Grover locking tuners, the look nice and the work and keep the guitar in tune.

Sweet in that there are not that many books on Branham and this book gives an excellent historical account of his ministry. The book is bitter in that, although the end of Branham's ministry was tragic in that he fell into doctrinal error, even the beginning of this prophet's ministry in \\"The Healer Prophet..\\"is portrayed with a skeptical, almost negative twist to it. This is Weaver's Ph.D. dissertation from a traditional, non-charasmatic seminary - which \\"may\\" account for the sometimes negative tone when the writer describes Branham's use of spiritual gifts. Never-the-less, Weaver's historical account is very good and informative.

CD1; Blues & Rhythm CD 2; Jumping & Doowopping; CD3; Hillbilly Bopping & CD 4; It's only Rock & Roll. While there are many old standbys that show up on almost every Rock & Roll compilation; there are several obscure tracks that make this purchase worthwhile. My only criticism is the doo-wop disc suffers from many weak entries that do not represent the genre as best as could be hoped for, and the hillbilly country disc could use more rockabilly to better represent that genre's significant impact. Most painfully lacking are any entries from Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis, Gene Vincent and Eddie Cochran, all four as important to the formation and grammar of Rock & Roll as anyone. Their absence from this anthology can only be due to copyright issues. Still, a good collection for any early R & R enthusiast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Muder By Phone","review":"Alright...'Murder By Phone'. It was an okay movie.

This movie is pretty much about a crazed murderer dude who kills his victims by calling them + then playing a high frequency sound which makes them have like convulsions + then he sends high voltage through the phone + they die.

The carbide blade that Hitachi gives you with this saw is outstanding. If there's one flaw... it's the same for all miter saws and thats the dust collection. Even with a bag or shop vac connected, it'll still kick out a bit of sawdust behind the saw.

Yes, I realize this was the technology of the time but captions would not have been that hard to understand. Nor was the second presentation that useful or even interesting.

There was never a resolution to any question brought up in the film. Why was this happening to the lead character? I don't know. Why was he trying to perform this ceremony? I don't know.

Nice, smooth surfaces that need almost no sanding.The table is long enough, and the inside rollers strong and flat enough to avoid snipe.Be sure to get plenty of vacuum from your dust collection system because this planer is a chip factory.

The album has some chunks of rock, but as the CD inches toward the duet with Ike on \\"Baby, Get It On\\" we see a drastic change in the material of the CD. Tracks 6-9 were written and mostly produced by Ike. Instead of the classic rock songs, Tina begins to sing about men, love, and delves back into her Black R&B roots, which isn't a really bad thing. It just doesn't fit in with the mold of this album. Although tracks 10-12 are just thrown on the album to fill space, we receive some good, original chunks of the down home soul of the Tina Turner when she was still sweatin' it out on the Chitlin' Circuit with Ike, the long wigs, the Ikettes, and the Revue.

Kang handles the outer movements extremely adeptly and the Slovak Radio Symphony Orchestra offers a wonderfully textured song-like performance of the main theme in the slow movement. There are bigger names (Menhuin, Heifetz, Hahn) who have recorded this Concerto, but Kang offers a serviceable if not splendid rendition of a long, difficult piece.As for the Sibelius Concerto, I thought that the opening was played well but it loses its energy along the way. The recording itself also leaves much to be desired, as the winds and brass are hardly audible in the slow movement. While it is not the best one I've heard, Kang does a decent job handling the technical intricacies of the piece. For more illustrious recordings of the Sibelius Concerto get the Heifetz or Oistrakh recordings.

So I didn't get the hype. BUT, after seeing so many passionate lovers of this movie rate it 1 because of Lionsgate cuts, I'm wondering if that was enough to spoil the movie for the first time viewer.

It isn't worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"An Ephemeral Tale\\"","review":"If you are looking for drama, excitement or suspense, this movie will prove very disappointing. In fact, the bulk of the film deals with a group of endearing and quirky characters having a grand old time at a 1904 Dublin dinner party, where sentimentality, drinking, poetry readings and maudlin ballads prevail. In one brief moment, a couple engages in a sad pensive conversation.

Those 10 missing minutes also reveal the drinking problem of Freddy Malin, over which the hostesses of the party are fretting in the opening scenes. Without those 10 minutes, the fretting of the hostesses over Freddy's drinking make no sense.

In the meantime, Amazon UK offers a 83 minute version of the film, 10 minutes longer than the U.S. version, so one hopes and assumes that it is intact.Of course you need a DVD player that will play all regions.

It was the last movie he directed and stars his daughter, Anjelica, in one of her better performances. The film focuses one a holiday celebration in Dublin at the turn of the last century and features a great cast of Irish actors (only some of whom I had seen in previous pictures). It's focus on a lost first love and its different responses in a long time married coupled is a highlight. An Irish song at the end of the holiday party triggers this reaction and process of awareness on the part of the husband. The interaction between the family and its friends is explored in a subtle fashion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Remarkable Book!","review":"This has been a most welcome addition to my library of knitting patterns.

I went through the whole store (Babies R Us) and I noticed most of the drop sides crib weren't very smooth, but I wanted the option of being to drop the side since I am very short. If I had to decide on crib base on the side drop, it would be a hard choice b/c I couldn't find one that feels just right. For this crib, the side drop was good but it can be better. The Crib industry really need to find a better design. Also it is nice to be able to convert the crib to a toddler bed, and full size bed. You never know whether you need it or not. This crib seems sturdy enough to pass on to the next generation if you take good care of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont buy this","review":"I bought this crib because the movers broke our original crib and I needed one that Babies R Us had in stock.

And it lips out if the grooves easily, leaving the rail unattached in the front. It is not obvious when it happens, and I think it is very dangerous. I dont even let my daughter sleep in it because I do not feel she is safe.

As a crib it's okay, except that the rail guides malfunctioned after less than 6 months -- now we can't lower the rails. Before the rail guides broke, we liked the way you could lower the rail with one hand, but it's not silent going up or down, so your baby could wake up from the noise.Once your child learns to climb out, the hardware is included to make a full size head board and footboard out of it -- you would still have to buy the actual bedframe. They advertise that you can turn it into a toddler bed, but when you read the instructions, it just says to remove the rail -- that doesn't make it a toddler bed -- a toddler bed needs a toddler rail to hold the child in -- Martinique does not come with the toddler rail, and there is not even one available you can get.Since we don't have room for a full size bed, we consider the Martinique a big waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad writing","review":"Plot and characters are adequate, and it doesn't start too badly, but the quality of the writing steadily declines and by mid-book the writing is ghastly.

It is said that he had to resort to reading from cue cards and having his lines fed to him through an earpiece because he could not remember them, in the scaffold scene among others.Demi Moore can make as many strong-woman movies as she wants.

This movie is a mockery of what Hawthorne intended (that can be easily seen - just from the movie's tag line) and insults the art of page to screen adaptation... this movie does deserve one star purely b/c it made me laugh...

This is the absolute worst movie of all time. I have never seen something that could go more against itself in every way. My description of the Count of Monte Cristo movie pales in comparison to what I feel about this one. In one word, it is vile. The entire focus of the book, however much I did not like it, was shifted to a Hollywood action movie filled with stupidity. The main character in the book is absolutely nothing like the one in the movie. The despair that the book projected is not even visible in the movie, which just happens to be one of its best parts. I mean, for God sakes, the man is saved by the arrow of an Indian from a hanging! WHERE DID THAT COME FROM? Anyway, to say more would only be rambling, so I leave with a suggestion: never see this movie, EVER!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for intelligent viewers","review":"As a great fan of Nathaniel Hawthorne's original novel and also of Gary Oldman's acting, I awaited this film with some eagerness. In vain, it turned out. It is among the most awful movies I've ever wasted two hours watching. In this film version, the story is given a totally ridiculous happy ending, with the Reverend rescuing Hester Prynne on horseback and riding off into the sunset to live happily ever after with her! Hester is supposed to live out the rest of her days as an outcast! Terrible stuff. If you're looking for decent films set in the C17th / C18th United States, try 'The Crucible' or 'Sleepy Hollow'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the energy, money or time","review":"There are no words to describe this movie. Nathaniel Hawthorne was probably rolling in his grave when it premiered.

There's not a better word to describe this so call movie. There are many problems with this film.Let's start with the acting. Demi Moore has no business acting! She couldn't act to save her Life. The others are ok, but Moore being the main character absolutely ruined the film. Why can't these Hollywood people get a real actress instead of a celebrity personality is beyond me.Second, the plot was so idiotic. The book actually has meaning, and contrary to other people beliefs, this is an extremely profound book. This film's plot lacks any meaning or nuances.To Butcher a classis like this is unforgivable. Should have been -5 starsP.S. Demi Moore needs acting lessons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie in its own right...","review":"Forget the classic Hawthorne novel...put all that aside. Pretend you've never read it. This movie is loosely based on that story, so don't waste your time comparing it or you'll miss the brilliance of this film.Demi Moore actually pulls off some fine acting and Gary Oldman is captivating...I can still see those blue eyes. Robert Duvall is basically a nut, but that is entertaining in itself. The love story is sweet, sentimental, and beautiful.Don't judge this film for its abilty to accurately portray the novel, just watch it for its own unique story and experience it for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Joffe's version of The Scarlet Letter is inferior.","review":"If you want a version of The Scarlet Letter that is true to Nathaniel Hawthorne's novel of the same name, Joffe's film version is not for you. The version will appeal to moviegoers who enjoy the lurid details that an R-rated film can offer, but were only hinted at in Hawthorne's day. For students of American Literature, the Meg Foster version is best. It is true to Hawthorne and is the film of choice for American Literature instructors."},{"rating":"1","title":"consider the source","review":"Anyone who would award this movie five stars is unlikely to possess the intellect necessary to read Hawthorne."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movies are never like the books.....","review":"I read the book AFTER I saw the movie. Movies are never like the books. Everyone knows that. This movie somewhat updated some of the ideas in the book. Such as witchcraft, etc. It also showed the role of the Native Americans during this puritan era. It is an excellent period movie. If no one knew it was based on the novel, I think the criticism would be different.Gary Oldman is excellent as the reverend, and I believed Demi as the rebellious puritan woman. The love story is intense."},{"rating":"1","title":"So pathetic!","review":"\\"free adaptation\\" is not the right term for this movie. \\"Piece of (garbage)\\" would be much closer.

In it's place is a confused action flic which culminates in a macbre game of musical chairs at the scaffold. First it's \\"hang the witches\\", then it's \\"hang Hester Pryne\\", then finally let's \\"hang the minister !\\" In the end, no one hangs due to a convenient and bloody Indian Uprising. That none of these things were present in Hawthorne's masterpiece is apparently of no consequence.

They were helpless with laughter in places!The film bears only a slender resemblance to the novel, and as for Demi Moore! Who told the girl she could act?Even the usually good Robert Duvall was rubbish, although the way his character had been re-written was completely different to the book. And Gary Oldman must surely regret appearing in such tripe.Considering that HAwthorne is a well-respected American writer, I am surprised Hollywood made such a pig's ear of one of his novels.Carolyn Devine"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"For an erotica of this kind, I would say this film wasd portrayed perfectly (not by the story of course). Although not having nearly that much to do with the original story (which I am not a fan of) this film is a wonderful erotica/drama. I think Gary Oldman's performance is riveting and very convincing over-all. Although, Demi Moore does seem a bit out of place in this film, it is a good 5-star movie. However, fans of the original story will most-likely not appreciate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Truly, TRULY, Terrible Movie Beginning To End!","review":"I hope if O sama is captured by the US he is forced to sit through this movie ten times a day.Demi More's laughable and yet still painfully boring production of The Scarlet Letter is simply one of the worst motion pictures ever made. It is not merely bad, but remarkably bad. I found it completely absurd, tedious, ludicrous, and felt it was \\"freely adapted\\" to the detriment of the depth of the original source. This feminist, new agey re-telling of a classic bears scant resemblance to the Hawthorne tale and is unworthy of sharing the title. Sometimes a free adaptation can improve upon the original novel, as with the 1990's version of The Last of the Mohicans, but in this case the reverse was never truer. I could go on and on with what is wrong with this film but why don't I just say EVERYTHING is wrong with this film. Never have I laughed harder AT, not WITH, a movie in my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Scarlet Letter is Beautiful","review":"I know this movie is not highly rated by most but I found it to be a very beautiful film. Disassociate from the book for a moment and appreciate the film as it's own work of art. With the tender, emotional music and touching way of having been filmed, I find this a true love story. I highly recommend this and/or the CD soundtrack for times when you need a good dose of something emotional."},{"rating":"1","title":"laughable","review":"Our English class watched this movie after reading the book--and laughed the entire time. The \\"sermon\\" with Demi Moore's lustful face fading onto Oldman's was hilarious (it brought to mind Grease's Summer Lovin', but worse). The addition of a slave girl named Mituba who does nothing but spy on Hester is unsettling. The sex scene (bed of dried beans? I don't think so) was not erotic, especially with Mituba's hilarious bathtub action. With Hester's anachronistic \\"spunky\\" attitude and Pearl's \\"touching\\" narration, this movie is one to miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eagle Eye Review","review":"The only reason I like this movie is that I was in it.

Any attempt to view the DVD with Windows Media Player, Corel WinDVD and/or Total Media 3 (that's 3 media playlers!) was unsuccessful and froze up, twice even crashing my PC! Obviously I would not install this useless software and the DVD would not play without it. I got my PC up and running OK and played 3 other DVDs to check my media players and DVD drive.

Yes","review":"Some of our resident reviewers take life much too seriously. It states up front that the story is 'freely based' on the Hawthorne story. And so what of it? The film was photographed beautifully, the cast is good and I was entertained. What more is there? The only thing that disappoints me about the DVD is that it's full screen. I had the laserdisc of this movie years ago and it was Panavision 2.35:1. I'm hoping they'll come out with a Blu Ray version as really like the movie.

Demi Moore eats dust as an actress. And what's with adding the mute Negro slave who takes a bath, the flaming Injun arrows, the happy ending?About 4/5 of this movie has nothing to do with the original story. Wooden bathtubs. Nudity. Skinny dipping. Nudity. Stupidity. Nudity. Voyeurism.I admit I laughed a lot - it's more ludicrous than something by the Marx Brothers.If you want cheese, get some Velveeta.If you want corn, get this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"a real laugher","review":"Demi Moore's overwrought acting and nearly complete misunderstanding of her role make \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" a real laugher. If you are looking for something to brighten your day, this unintended parody will more than do the trick.Anyone familiar with the American classic will find few similarities here. If anything, by the movie's end, you will be sympathizing with the clergyman who was the weak-spined anti-hero of the original. High students who view this film as an aid to their assigned reading of Hawthorne are strongly cautioned, as it would not be helpful.Recommended only as an example of to what truly awful level Demi Moore's interpretive acting can sink."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, did anyone read the book!!!!!!","review":"I hated the book in high school because it was so boring and protracted, but over the years I found myself enjoying the story more and more. This movie seemed like a chance to tell the story right, WRONG!!! The whole thing plays like soft core porn and the story has been so horribly changed as to beg the change of the title to \\"Demi Moore gets nude and brings the ERA amendment to the Puritans\\". A waste of actors and film. THE WORST EVER!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a hokey, amusing version of the scarlet letter","review":"The Scarlet Letter is pure Hollywood...a sensual love scene between a preacher and an \\"innocent\\" waif, an indian fight in the middle of nowhere, and Demi Moore masturbating in a bathtub. The problem here, is that Demi Moore is completely wrong for this part in all ways. She loses the innocence that Hester Prynne had in the book, and changes her into a 19th century slut. She is all wrong for a period piece, and her accent proves it. However, you can't blame a gifted actress like Moore for a movie that is all together sloppy. I'm not going to say, \\"stick to the book\\", but this movie is a dud. However, if you do see it once, you might find a certain guilty pleasure amongst all the ludicrous actions that take place within this movie, which is why I give it 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great love story","review":"I love this movie for Gary Oldman as he is one of the finest actors of our time.

Gary's passion and talent make it good."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BETRAYAL OF HAWTHORNE'S VISION","review":"Vapid pseudo-adaptation of Nathaniel Hawthorne's timeless novel of guilt, conscience, and the darker side of religion. Inverts the original novel's themes of prejudice and redemption into a New Age libertine manifesto. The atrocious script has some of the worst dialogue ever and plays like a deranged parody of Hawthorne's magnificent prose. Great cast of Demi Moore, Gary Oldman and Robert Duvall is totally wasted. For a much better film treatment of many of the same themes see \\"The Crucible,\\" but avoid this travesty at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"If Only!","review":"Unfortunately, the technical details provided by Amazon.com did not mention that this DVD release was a full screen (pan & scan) version.

I'm in the middle of reading the book right now. There is maybe a total of 10 minutes worth of action written into it and I'm not surprised that creative license needed to be taken for the screenplay.I love the story line and the way the actors portrayed the deep and painful struggle between their hearts and the status quo of the times.Gary Oldman is overwhelming in his role.

I have come away from this book with a much better understanding of the nutritional needs of my pets and how to feed them to promote health and longevity. I also have gained some insight into how to spot signs of nutritional deficiencies in my pets. Surpisingly two of the writers of this book appear to work for Iams, a rather large and well known pet food company. This book was far from biased for the pet food industry nor did it appear to promote any pet food.

He has a strong interpretation of music which makes Carulli's somewhat boring pieces suddenly become entertaining. This album reminds us of how great of a composer that Carulli really was. Savino shows that he is a gutsy player with flawless technique. This was proved to me by attending a concert of his where he put on an arpeggio show as he likes to do. Savino is one of the most underated guitarists of our time and in my opinion has the maturity and poise to be rated right up there with Segovia, Williams, and Bream. THIS ALBUM IS A MUST HAVE FOR ANY GUITARIST!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent recording","review":"I will agree with earlier posts (as these people can communicate musical phrasing better than I).

This can be an excellent reference recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sonics are the catch","review":"This is some of the more interesting music I have heard from Carulli, and expressively and expertly played by Richard Savino on a very interesting looking instrument that you can see in the notes. However, the recorded CD sound is not good, perhaps the worst of the many guitar albums I have owned. The frequency response seems to cut off at about 4000 Hz, making the guitar sound muffled and unrealistic. We may be talking about quality control at Naxos instead of recording glitches, but my advice is: do not buy this CD unless you need the music and do not mind a smothered guitar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as a lot of people would have you think.","review":"Yes, The Sounds have a very produced \\"sound\\" that to unexperienced ears comes off as catchy and rockin. The fact is the sound of this Swedish band is super sugar-coated and unsophisticated. Take a look at the song titles, \\"Rock n' Roll\\", \\"Dance With Me\\", and \\"Riot\\". The songs are almost as unoriginal as their titles. Comparing this band to Blondie is a stretch. The keyboard player doesn't seem to know what a chord is and the rest of group is playing at the same volume for the duration of the record. If you're in jr. high, go for it, if you're looking for a lasting rock album, go elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell short of my expectations.","review":"I was disappointed in this album.

This band is the real deal and they are FANTASTIC. I hope they get radio play here -- this is genuine grade A+ new wave and I LOVE this cd. Musically the band is talented (great melodies, solid song structure) and the lyrics are wry and reminiscent of the best late seventies/early eighties songsters, especially Blondie. The lead singer is a slightly meaner and more aloof Debbie Harry, with a great, dynamic voice that blends Harry's vocal grace with Pat Benatar's bite.ALL HAIL THE SOUNDS!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pop the way it should be made","review":"Gee, what a fantastic album! I've had this gem for something like two years now and I never get tired of it.The Sounds may have a strong Blondie influence, but there's also some Depeche Mode around (the keyboards on songs like Rock n' Roll and Mine for Life) and some Ramones and pretty obvious punk stuff.This is a very uplifting record, and I don't mean it's just happy and danceable, but the lyrics are uplifting too in a very misfit way.If you love your pop to have some strength to it and a very heavy 80s influence, then think no more and buy this record just because you will be happy to do so.I've seen them live at the Hard Rock Cafe in Mexico City and they blew me away.

This is one of the catchiest albums of the year, each song filled with hook after hook. \\"Seven Days a Week\\" is a great song, and I'm surprised it hasn't taken off more than it has. It is such a feel-good song, it is hard to listen to it and not smile. This is the same for much of the album, as we are either brought back to the 80's, or getting our first taste of what music was like in that odd decade.This is only a three-star album, with one additional star simply for \\"Seven Days a Week\\". The songs can get repetitive, and often the keyboards overbear the rest of the instruments. I would like to hear the guitars a little more, but what can you do?This is a good album because it is an impressive throwback to the few good things about the 80's, but not good enough to make you want to go and buy all of Toto's and Wham!'s albums.

This is the worst picture quality among all the blu-ray movies I have seen. I bought all three movies for video quality testing, but this quality just didn't work for me. QUESTART obviously does not know how to produce high quality blu-ray movies. This scenic contents appear to be blurry, grainy, and it does not appear to have native 1080p resolution. I give it two stars for the contents itself, but overall for the quality, video is not properly encoded ... low bit rate, wrong frame rate, it is all messed up. I only paid $7 but still feel money wasted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silver Wings","review":"I First read \\"Silver Wings\\" in 1949. At the time I gave a book report in my high school English Class.

This stuff is a like a watered down version with the same scent. The smell washes of your body with the soap. About the only thing that has not changed is the price, (now we can easily say this stuff is way over priced!

I've been buying this product for years, but recently they have decided to change the pumps on the gallon. Previously, the pumps had a spring in them and were well made and lasted the entire time that you had the gallon product....which is generally pretty long. Now the pump breaks in a few weeks. It's junk. And you are stuck with a large amount of Vitabath and no way to get it out of the container. So I've had to transfer it to smaller generic containers just to use it up. I won't be buying the gallon again. By the way, I called Vitabath in New York and asked them to please send me a replacement pump. I even said I would be happy to pay for it. They told me they would send it to me free of charge. Of course it never came. Don't buy the gallon!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Large size is a good buy of a good product","review":"I bought the larger size this time, and will do it again.

This product did nothing but dry my skin."},{"rating":"1","title":"The original Spring Green formula has changed","review":"Shame on Vitabath. I've used the Spring Green gelee for years and I just replenished my stock with two 1 gallon bottles. The incredible evergreen scent that permeates my apartment every time I take a shower is effectively gone. The scent is so weak now that it fades out almost immediately. I'm so disappointed in Vitabath - I went to their web site but found no mention of a change in their formula. If you are expecting the wonderful, aromatherapy-grade evergreen scent, be forewarned: It's a thing of the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful smell","review":"I normally place a great deal of importance on fellow Amazon users' reviews, which led me to purchase Vitabath after seeing the glowing comments.When I received the bottle in the mail, the first thing I noticed was a faintly nauseating scent coming from the body wash even before I opened it. Once I squirted out a small amount to use, the smell was overwhelming. It lingered in my shower even when I wasn't using it. The smell was so strong and nauseating, I eventually had to throw out my exfoliating sponge as I could smell it everytime I held it to my face.For many, it appears to get the job done. For me, the smell was so nauseating I had to throw out the entire bottle.Also, after I showered it felt like there was a filmy residue left on my skin that made me feel like taking a second shower.Buyer beware, this body wash is a 'your mileage may vary' experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic indeed","review":"This is quite possibly the best smelling book about movies with which I have ever had the pleasure of spending an afternoon.

I decided to go with this unit for size considerations. Since I am just one person, I decided that I could move the hose from machine to machine. This has proved to be more of a pain than I anticipated, so you may want to consider a more powerful machine if you plan on installing permenent ductwork.I must say though, that the unit has performed its function, and dust is not nearly the problem it used to be.

Slowly the company has been skimping on the amount of actual lime oil used in the product -- now so little is used that it hardly has any odor at all, and smells instead like linseed oil, rendering it all but useless as a deodorizer. I don't think I'll be buying any more of this company's products. Currently, the tops of the cans don't even match the bottoms -- a sure sign that the company is focusing on skimping and on maximizing profits rather than on producing a good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing good lasts forever","review":"About 10 years ago this was a really great product. Nothing could beat it. Then, it got noticeably less great. Then, they stopped producing for about a year due to a sourcing issue. Now they're making Lime Mate again, but it's not at all the same product. The \\"spray\\" is very oily and makes the floor slippery and stains anything it comes in contact with. The fragrance has turned into an odor, more like rotting fruit than limes. The last case I bought was mostly unusable - the sprayers don't even spray!

Both of them leak so much each time we spray that our hands are covered with the product and it is dripping from the bottle. In the past, we have had a little problem with leaking after using the spray for a long time. But now, as soon as we began to use it, it was leaking like crazy! I hope they figure out what is wrong with these, because there is no other spray that comes close to the smell. I can't stand most sprays that are full of chemicals.

All the differebt routes to go, and the great quality trains. We found it very easy to put together. The instructions for the train track are also very easy to follow. My son also likes it when we take the train track off and he plays cars on the top. We have stuck down some pieces using blu- tac just because the bridge parts can become unstable and my one year old likes to pull the tracks. The table will be easy to make taller as my son grows. The storage buckets are excellent. Overall very happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many pieces","review":"We gave this to our 2-year old grandson for Christmas, & he seemed enthused by it. BUT, the tracks are very wobbly and come apart far too easily, especially the sections that are elevated. We glued the trees together, otherwise he would have just kept knocking them over and they fall apart far too easily, so they would have become lost. The train magnets are only strong enough to maintain 3 cars together. I guess only time will tell how much he will play with it, but we think overall, it will cause frustration.

For example, almost all the backbacker accommodations mentioned in the UB section have closed down, and it doesn't mention Gana's Guest House which is the only place to stay if you're on a budget. Also, it underestimates the travel times between different towns, and makes some of them sound quite big when in fact they are tiny.

I found this book not only derogatory of the Mongolian people, but woefully outdated (that was in 1997!). Furthermore, the maps in this book are tragically wrong; particularly when you get out into the rural areas. Lastly and most disturbing was the overall negative attitutde behind this book.

This book offers more of the same in the form of an intergalactic battle to the death in a labrinyth (which is actually the New York Public Library). The aliens and their guides provide much of the action as well as humor. Dr. Stephen Swain, the human chosen to represent his species in the contest, finds himself battling assorted humanoid and reptilian species while trying to keep his young daughter free from harm. It's more slam-bang than, say,the stories of Isaac Asimov, but it's a very good read for a rainy day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Actionpacked adventure","review":"Dr Stephen Swain and his daughter Holly are trapped in the seventh Presidian held in a New York State library.Stephen and Holly are suddenly caught in a contest they didn't enter. The Presidian is the battle between the dominant species of each world from every corner of the universe.

Well, I hope they get better!The premise is great; seven contenders from all the intelligent races in the universe brought together in a \\"labyrinth\\" to fight it out until only one is left standing. However, the writing in this book is very immature and the author hasn't yet learned how to create true tension that makes you want to turn the pages as quickly as you can. In Contest you know from the very beginning how it will all turn out. There's no character development, but that's not really expected in this type of novel and doesn't generally stop me from enjoying them.Well, hopefully he has improved and I can write a more positive review on Temple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun read","review":"The Contest is both cheesey and engrossing. It reads like a Michael Crichton novel and smacks of a blockbuster movie with way too many CGI characters in our future. Despite that, however, The Contest is a highly enjoyable read, though the premise of hardly believable. But if you're looking for a good book to curl up with on a rainy day - or something to take with you to the beach this summer - The Contest is definitely a book worth checking out. Suspend your reality for a day, and give it a try. However, I'll take a moment to mention this is the only Matthew Reilly novel I would recommend. I attempted to read his other novels after reading this one and found them all to be stale and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was totally abominable","review":"I am an easy to please reader...a little suspense, a little gore, a semi-believable plot and I am content. This joke had me totally disenchanted from page one. The plot is so totally CONTRIVED and unsuspenseful it will shock you. Of course everyone who reads this review will discount it as most other reviews are favorable but BELIEVE ME this was awful and I'm trying to save you from wasting your hard earned cash. It's the least I can do."},{"rating":"2","title":"About the only","review":"Matt Reilly book that I like, and it happens to be his first one. I don't usually read sci-fi anymore, but I thought the premise was a good one.Unlike his thrillers, this sci-fi book is actually quite good. Maybe he should be a sci-fi writer instead.I won't spoiler the book, but suffice it to say that it's about a human being thrown into a challenge against unwinnable odds where the losers get death. It happens to be quite thrilling, being locked in the library and the characters are quite unlike Reilly's 2D ones. You actually like the protagonist. The ending is fine too. It's too bad that Reilly did not stick with sci-fi. Worth a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"This was my first Matthew Reilly book and I had no idea what was coming. The reverse of the book only said it was a contest for life and death but it totally left out the alien angle.The idea of an alien gladiator-kind battle on earth was quite a (pleasant) surprise and the book turned out to be a real roller-coaster.Who cares that this book does not really have complex characters/story if it is that fast paced and highly entertaining? I could not put it down and I am really looking forward to read more of Reilly!PSWill there really be a movie about this book on day?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech","review":"What a disappointment despite the praise on review sites - the whole story reads like a badly written Sci-Fi original movie script, complete with predictable outcomes, completely unrealistic situations (yes, it's a sci fi story, but there are still parts that just don't make sense and are just there to move the story along rather than stop to make a point about them), and boring dialogues.At -best-, it's a teenage-written fan fiction on a science fiction site online. Don't bother with this one. I'll be giving this author another chance by visiting the library for his other titles, but I'm not hopeful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this and read the rest","review":"I realize this was his first book, but had I read it first, then I would have never wasted my money on another. That being said, I would have missed the many hours of enjoyment I have received from most of his other books. The plot and characters in this one wouldn't have made a good comic book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesnt even rate as amateur writing","review":"This is the poorest excuse for a novel I have ever come across in a bookstore. I dislike being so critical and I understand this was a first novel, but the truth is, I feel deceived and conned from purchasing this book and would like to warn others. The only effort put into this book is in advertising. This does not in any way qualify as professional writing, it is beyond poor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jet Saw - Looks good","review":"The saw was delivered on a substandard pallet whose height was such that the lift would not fit under it. As a result damage was sustained to the pallet and shipping crate. Luckily, the saw was not damaged. The extention table was delivered without legs - not clear from the photos and ad text. The extention table top support had a misaligned screw that broke out of the edge of the oak support. Assembly was easy, instructions were excellent. I'm impressed with the power of the saw. In spite of the minor annoyances cited above leading to 4 vice 5 stars, I'm happy with the saw and look forward to long years of service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny","review":"What a great saw! Take advantage of what Jet has to offer here. This is basically a Powermatic saw, for about $[money] less! I have to admit that the legs for my extension table arrived bent from shipping, but the service team at Amazon took care of me and shipped a new pair that arrived within the week. Setup of the saw was fairly easy, if a bit time consuming. Once I got it put together though, it ran very smoothly.

The locking mechanism on my fence is comming loose so that it won't hold its position well. I, therefore, called Jet Tools to order a new fence. I was met with unbelievable resistance. The person I talked to was extremely unhelpful and rude. I told him my problem and he told me that he cannot find me a fence that will match my saw despite giving him the stock and serial numbers and the specific type of saw I own. I even offered to take the fence to the distribution center in LeVergne, TN to show him (I live about 15 minutes away from it). He told me that this will be unhelpful. Therefore, I am left with a saw with a broken fence with no one to help me get a new one. Otherwise, the saw is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than a Delta?

The table is just great, the process of putting it together was relatively easy since the manuals were not that well developed. Jet needs to review the instructions and provide a good list of parts for the whole assembly. They could go as far as adding other items as suggestions i.e. table mobile bases, dado inserts, etc.As for the fence, I agree with the great majority, I had to play with it. I was about to buy a new fence but I decided to call the Jet tech support and they gave me some ideas in how to correct my erros. Am I 100% satisfy? I will say I am 1/16\\" off in my adjustment.

I would not recommend this ball for players that like to \\"let the club do all the work,\\"All I know is that the first 2 shots I hit with the Power Soft ball were a GIR to a 180-yard par 3 and a subsequent birdie. Can't argue with that.Also, I prefer Nike balls in general because I don't like trying to line up the ball's logo with where I'm hitting it. Many people like that, but I prefer a ball that has a non-linear logo, and Nike (the swoosh) fits the bill. I know, it's a psychological thing, but, hey, it's golf. It's ALL psychological anyway.

My reasons are as follows:1. It is narrated in the present tense, which makes it difficult to read. Few authors can, or should, attempt this.2. Gross factual errors. I don't remember such cases in the earlier books, but he confuses geology with geography, refers to closer to shore (in the sea) as \\"inland\\", makes consistent errors in Genus species (Genus is always capilatized; species NEVER is, he keeps reversing it), and equates volcanic eruptions with warming climates, when the reverse is true.It is also sloppily written/edited, to the point that I can no longer believe the same author wrote this and the two previous books.Well, I'll try to slog through some more, but it sure is slow, and painful, going!PeglegI decided to edit this review, and drop my rating from 2 stars to zero.

Almost nothing of what happens is interesting to me. This Daredevil idea is wholy unrealistic...almost stupide. I feel that way because in the real world a TV show like that where people risk their own lives would simply not be allowed to happen.

Marren said that he had been chasing some elusive creature for 8 years... I am hoping we get introduced to this creature in book four (Lochness monster? - haven't read The Loch yet). It will probably eat Angel and leave her pups for book five?There was one disappointing point in this book for me. Who cut the line on the Neptune? Someone on the Neptune is a murderer and it didn't come clean at the end of the book. It could not have been Marren, or his samuri goon, and there is no mention of anyone else in Marren's back pocket. I found that a bit sloppy.

This book was a great addition to his Meg series. Not only is he a great writer, but he cares and responds to his many fans, not too many authors do that anymore. I hope that this series(my favorite of all time)keeps getting added to, with new books!!! If anyone read Meg and The Trench, definately read this book!!!

A number of years later--thanks in part to my father's teaching--I learned that there is good and bad in all peoples.Like any other experiences told in book form, Inga's account tells only of her personal experiences--but what heart-wrenching experiences they are.Some 50 years after the war had ended I was fortunate enough to meet Inga, and I hope I am not being presumptuous when I say that we became very good friends.

See, in order for satire to work, it has to be grounded in truth. Otherwise it's just an absurd claim that makes one scratch one's head rather than laugh. This volume is filled with these head-scratchers.Apparently Hubbard's idea of satire is saying things like, 'All Turks have 'Bey' following their name.' That borders on racism. Or take Hubbard's assertion that all government officers are corrupt and that the IRS is evil. Sure there are some segments of society that believe these two things, but they're idiots. Truth dictates that neither of the above precepts are true, ruining Hubbard's attempt at satire.It's a fairly interesting story.

His type of upbeat humor and choice of narrator will keep this reader enthralled. After the first two books, one begins to feel sorry for Soltan Gris, and rightly so.

The same simple way to stay healthy has been with us since the paleolithic era, and always will be: eat all things in moderation and get some excercise. That has been the only proven formula to stay at a reasonable weight since time began. Atkins, the current flavor of the year, is popular because some people believe, fairly or not, that you can lose weight simply by cutting carbs and they forget that we all need a bit of excercise. (Have you ever noticed how a lot of these health gurus drop dead at age 50?) So, stop reading stupid books and go take a walk around the block. You know enough not to stuff yourself at McDonald's, just eat less and exercise more, for heaven's sake. Surprise!

But I think you'll find it's a very effective and healthy weight loss program. A couple of important points that are contained in the book, but need to be stressed: 1) You MUST drink a lot of water on a daily basis; 2) You should take a good multivitamin daily (which you should doing anyway) and a potassium supplement (during the first few weeks at least). Some people who have reviewed this diet have stated that it didn't agree with them (e.g., tired, muscle cramps, etc.). This is caused by not following items 1 and 2 above. Give it a try; I think you will find the Atkins' Diet really works.

Like the other 7 friends I know who lost weight and have since regained more on this diet, I have gained my weight back also. This is impossible to follow long term.

I wish I had known about the diet years ago but I believed that only a low calorie diet could work. After the reading the book and beginning the diet it was as if a great secret was revealed to me. Although you should read the book, the diet boils down to two rules. Eat as much protein and fat as you need not to be hungry.

He says it's fine to eat foods high in saturated fat. Its fine to eat animal protein in large amounts. Can this be right?

The fact is most Americans already get enough protein in their diets. They also get too many carbs, but that's from overeating and over-indulgence in highly processed foods... not because carbs are inherently bad. Moderation on all fronts is the only diet that works.

Furthermore excessive protein may leach calcium from the bones. DON'T TAKE MY WORD FOR IT.

People sometimes lose weight on this diet, but not for the reasons that the author claims. First of all, a high protein diet causes dehydration. Anyone losing more than a pound or two per week is almost certainly losing water weight. Peeing more won't make you thin, period.Second, although the author describes the diet as \\"luxurious\\" it is actually very restrictive. The only reason anyone loses weight is because she expends more calories than she takes in. There is nothing special about the diet itself, except that it tends to be rather unappetizing to most people. Consequently, they may eat fewer calories and thereby lose weight.A stated aim of the Atkins Diet is to induce ketosis, a metabolically toxic state. Weight-loss can cause ketosis, not the other way around!

Adkins claims that since carbs cause the release of insulin eliminate carbs and you will not store fat. True but protein still releases insulin. The ONLY way to lose weight is to burn more calories than you consume. FACT: CARBS= 4 cals per gram, PROTEIN 4 cals per gram, Alcohol 7 cals per gram, and FAT 9 cals per gram.

Sure you'll lose weight on Atkins but what are you giving up in exchange for a few pounds? The consumption of animal products has been conclusively linked with heart disease, cancer, diabetes, arthritis, and osteoporosis. Cholesterol (found only in animal products) and animal fat clog arteries, leading to heart attacks and strokes.

The precursor to serotonin, tryptophan, is found in proteins but it will only cross the blood-brain barrier if it is carried in long-chain amino acids that are ONLY FOUND in carbohydrates. In other words if you cut out carbohydrates from your diet, you will eventually diminish the amount of serotonin in your brain and it will begin to affect your functioning.I strongly urge you to consult with your doctor on the pros and cons of a long term commitment to this controversial diet.

I can say that, because I tried it and got violently ill (nausea, acid reflux, vomiting).

But the diet was hard to stick to: who wants to eat meat and cheese all the time? Granted, I did lose weight, but I gained I as soon as I stopped. Also, the \\"free\\" food all require preparation and are expensive to buy. I now spend less than $40 a week on groceries, but the Atkins diet had me spending upwards of $70 because meat, cheese and other fatty foods are costly. Besides, can a diet really be good for you if your breath stinks from ketosis, you have constipation and can't eat food grown from the earth? If you need to lose a quick 10 or 20 lbs for an event Atkins is okay, but other than that, this diet is worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems pretty close to Sugar Busters to me","review":"I feel as if this effort by Dr. Atkins is a clone of Sugar Busters only with different recipes.Nice try though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining, but a little unreal","review":"This diet started out with a bang!

Huh? Has anyone else had the same problem? Oh, and by the way, have you checked out the prices for products on the Atkins website? OUCH! $2.69 for a carbo-bar! Plus S&H! Here's a tip from me: Walgreen's sells ketone strips (not \\"lipolysis strips\\") for $9.99, as opposed to $12.99 plus S&H from Atkins.

I have gone from 178 to 163 in 7 weeks. What everyone fails to realize is that Dr. Atkins gives you the tools to work with and tells you how to use them. Each individual chooses to use the tools in his/her own way. For example, most critics say that all you eat is protein and that is true for people who choose to eat protein only. In his book the New Diet Revolution he does give some recipes that have vegetables and great recipes they are. Two thumbs up to Dr. Atkins for teaching me how to eat and lose weight too. The only thing I have really semi-eliminated from my previous diet is sugar. Sugar isn't very good for you anyway so what is there to complain about.

I've tried other low-carb diets and Sugarbusters was the one I like the best, it allows for more carbs and was able to stay in ketosis.

If you love meat, this is the diet for you. Just remember, have patience, you didn't put the weight on overnight, and it won't disappear overnight, but this diet makes it alot easier to lose it.

I know this isn't true for everyone, but I finally had to throw in the towel, and I've talked to others who have had similar experiences on Atkins. For anyone else who has experienced depression, anxiety or cloudiness on this diet, then I suggest following the food plan in either Kay Shepard's book, Food Addiction: The Body Knows, or Dr. Matthew Keene's Chocolate is My Kryptonite: Feeding Your Feelings/How to Survive the Forces of Food.

The book really gives you incentive to stick to the diet. You do have to be willing to cook and have many ideas for cooking eggs different ways, or you can easily get sick of them.

I have lost 15 pounds in a month (with considerable (cheating)I might add) I still can't believe that I can eat all this meat and fat and still lose weight! (Although even steak gets old after awhile, so I'm trying to diversify with other meats cooked in different ways.) However, the book is not well written. The line of thought meanders and rambles. It would be a much better read if it were just more organized. But, somewhere amid the rambling, one can glean the gist. Atkins states his case well that carbohydrate and sugar restriction is the key to denying your body glucose fuel, thus forcing it to burn fat reserves. The diet itself works great, but you might get a copy of \\"Protein Power\\" if you want more comprehensible reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely did not work for me!","review":"I gave this diet the two-week trial as specified in the book, and followed every instruction to the letter. The results?

I haven't felt this bad since I had the flu. Thanks but no thanks, Dr. Atkins!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Radical Approach Not For Everybody","review":"I have followed the low-carb diet for the past week and have decided to go on to something more balanced. I think Dr Atkins makes a good point about over-indulgenece in carbohydrates, but a radical approach like his is probably best for ppl who are middle aged and/or truly obese. For guys like me who are in their early 20s and already have a 31\\" waist but want to get \\"ripped\\",(ie lose 20 lbs or less) I would suggest reducing the overall amount of carbs (which should come from fruits, vegetables and whole grain breads), drinking a lot of water, and regular aerobic exercise. The carbs you really want to minimize are the ones in cereals, pasta and of course sugary foods. I also found with the Atkins-type diet that I had almost no energy to exercise, which can't be a good thing. In summary, I think the body requires a more balanced diet for healthy fat loss.

Some say they feel lightheaded and so on. You have to realize, as Dr. Atkins says in the book, that not everybody can loose on a diet like this one. Not everyone's metabolism is compatible. But if you are, and there's a 90% chance you are, then this diet works wonders. I've been on it only 5 days so far and have lost 5 pounds! A pound a day. This rapid weight loss is only during the first 14 days, during the \\"Inducton Diet.\\" After this you can adjust your level of carbs to suit your metabolism and the weight loss drops to about 3-4 pounds weekly. That is still better than low-fat diets at about 2 pounds a week.

Now, I'm restricted to eating less than 20 carbos a day if i do not want to gain weight again. If i do eat more than 20 carbos in one day, I'll end up gaining about 2.5 lbs the following day! I'm starting to feel seriously \\"trapped\\", in this diet. Not only that, but I'm severly constipated all the time, too! Sometimes, I wish that I never started this diet in the first place. So If youre seriously thinking about going on a low-carb diet, try reading Carbohydrate Addicts, or the Suzanne Sommer's Diet books.

Mostly, I notice that my clothes fit better, I have more energy and I never experience those \\"blood sugar ups and downs\\" that I used to have everyday..If you are overweight or just curious about alternative nutritional methods, goive this one a try.

Plus..it was too hard to stick to. It does teach you a lot about good carbs vs. bad carbs and how your system works, so in that aspect, it's good. Two weeks of no more than 20 carbs a day!?! I found that to compensate for this I was eating more of other bad stuff. Too much cheese, too much meat, and too much fat. I realized I was consuming more calories a day on this diet than before I started it. I do have to limit my carbs, but keeping it around 75g a day..I still lose weight. Plus, I limit my fat intake so not only am I doing low carbs, I'm keeping other bad stuff out of my system too. I've learned to eat closer to the source(ex. Potatoes instead of french fries) and avoid a lot of processed foods.This diet may be preferred by some, but for me, It just didn't fit with my lifestyle.

Carbohydrates are essential to good health. The ketosis that this diet produces in it's users cannot be good for the cardiovascular system in the long run. Ketosis also puts the kidneys and liver into stress.There is an ancient (east) Indian belief that those who eat an animal inherite the fear and feelings of the animal when it was killed. I also cannot believe that this diet can be good spiritually. If one watches Atkins speak one can see his agression and hostility brimming. This hostility often erupts if anyone disagrees with his rather nonscientific ideas. Perhaps it is many years of eating nothing but dead animals that has produced these most unflattering personality traits in this man.I must say I was never thinner and healthier than when I avoided all animal products."},{"rating":"1","title":"A stop-gap solution, but for the long term?","review":"If you have an urgent need, this may work like a short-term fix, much like a medical drug.

I lost 5 pounds, but it wasn't worth the struggle...it's nearly impossible not to eat carbohydrates. The book makes it sound like you can eat whatever you want and there's a great variety, but you can really only eat meat, some vegetables, and jello. I wouldn't call this a great \\"variety\\". I wish I could find a more realistic diet plan. Also, you feel very exhausted while on the diet because you're not getting enough nutrients. Supplements just don't do it.

And I've lost some weight!On the negative side, Dr. Atkins doesn't write in a very professional way--there's lots of hype and he puts down anybody who doesn't agree with him.

I've waited this long before I wrote a review because I wanted to see how easy it was to keep the weight off and so far it has been easy. Read the book and follow it without cheating for two weeks and you will not only lose weight but you will lose your cravings (addictions) to sugars, breads and other carbohydrates. This book will change your life. Good luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!!","review":"I have been on this diet for two weeks and have lost 15 pounds. This diet is easy to stay on, no starvation!!My husband has been on this diet two days less than me and has lost close to 20 pounds. This diet works and it doesn't take a lot of willpower."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT WORKS FOR ME!!!","review":"I've been on Dr. Atkins diet for exactly 1 month. Got on the scales today--lost 10 lbs. This has been one of the easiest diets/programs I've been on and I've been on a lot of diets. I get plenty to eat and I've stayed well within my 20 - 25 grams of carbs. Tomorrow, I start an excercise program and I expect the pounds to continue to drop off. I can't say that this diet is for everyone because it does requires a bit of willpower and control...both of which I didn't think I had until I started this diet. All I can say is...IT'S DEFINITELY WORKING FOR ME! I recommend you try it, at least for two weeks, especially if other diets have failed. What have you got to loose except WEIGHT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great (at first)","review":"I've been on Adkin's plan for about 3 months now. For the first 2 weeks of the diet, I lost about 10 pounds, and was initially pleased. However, I have only managed to lose another 5 pounds since the first 2 weeks! I think Adkins does bring up some valid points regarding the biochemistry of the diet, but overall I am not very pleased at the results of this plan. The writing style of Adkins gets a little old after awhile, as he's trying to persuade you that his plan is the best, and everyone else is wrong. One word of advice while you are out shopping for all your meat, eggs, and butter, buy a can of Metamucil, you are going to need it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SORRY I QUIT","review":"I WAS DOING SO WELL ON THIS DIET AND WITH ALL THE HYPE I QUIT. WELL THAT'S THE SORRIEST THING I HAVE EVER DONE. I AM MUCH MORE IN DANGER OF HAVING ILL EFFECTS BEING SO OVER WEIGHT. I AM BACK ON IT AND THE RESULTS ARE AMAZING."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to the original","review":"I didn't care for the revised version at all. The original version is still better. I've lost 42 pounds so far and kept them off for three years to date. The \\"new\\" version gives you too many ways to cheat, in my opinion, and is therefore less effective. My husband's cardiologist actually recommended Atkins when we asked for his opinion of what was most effective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Also...","review":"May I recommend The Low-Carb Cookbook by Frances Monsoon McCullough for plenty of easy, tasty recipes. Foods on the diet can seem limited, but there are many combinations that are really good. I made meringues and topped them with whipped cream and appx 5 sliced strawberries for a light desert. There are hardly any carbs in this dessert and trust me, it is very delicious. Do a search for the book title on Amazon and it is listed along with a few other books. Good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This diet is not supported by Mayo Clinic.","review":"After carefully checking the Mayo Clinic website, I found that they do not support or recommend this diet. Therefore, I now find it hard to put any validity in the book at all. I wonder how many other inaccurate statements might be contained that would effect my health. Prehaps you will want examine the website and then change yours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atkins Diet Book review","review":"This is the second book I purchased (gave the first one away) this diet (if you can call it a diet) is great! The book showed me how to lose a lot of weight fast and I have kept it off for several years, I use it for reference now with the recipes and lifetime maintenance being referred to regularly. I first purchased it because my doctor said my blood sugar and cholesterol were border line high, after following the program closely for several months, I have brought those numbers down considerably. With regular exercise I am able to increase my carb intake to a very comfortable level and enjoy many of the foods that most people say I cannot. The most amazing thing is what with cutting all sugar and bad carbs my energy level is easily twice what it used to be!I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amen Florida!","review":"I couldn't have said it better. Most people seem to think you continue to live on bacon and eggs. Not the case. As you progress, add the vegetables and fruits. A piece of toast with creme cheese. Just watch your carb intake and add some variety. The whole purpose of the induction is to get the metabolism to working.I'm in my third month and eat two servings of fruits, and 3 of vegetables along with plenty of meat and cheese. I'm still loosing weight. Not as fast, but still 1 or two pounds a week. If I'd ate this way before the induction, none of this would be burned for fuel, simply stored as fat.Some people need to read the book again. (if they ever read it in the first place.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"An all around feel good diet","review":"The first few days of this diet was tough getting used to but I am on my 10th day and feel great. I have lost 10 pounds and have more energy then before. My wife and I also bought the carb counter companion, and the cook book and found it very helpful. (By the way, she has lost 8 pounds) The only down side of the diet is that I am getting tired of eating eggs for breakfast and salad for lunch. Anytime you start wondering if this diet is for you, just hop on the scale and look at your weightloss. You need to do the diet to the letter during the first 14 days or you will miss what a great diet this is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Started Out With A Bang!","review":"My first week on this diet I lost 8 pounds. I am 3 days into my second week and have only lost 1 additional pound so far. I hope my weight loss isn't slowing down this soon as I have stuck to the diet to a T. Lunch and dinner are easy, meat and salad. Breakfast is hard. I am getting tired of the eggs. I think I will purchase the Atkins Bars, which I have found at GNC health food stores, for a breakfast alternative. I will try to post every 15 pound loss. I hope others keep posting as it is very inspiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hope it works!","review":"I have read the book through twice and continue to re-read sections of it for motivation. The book was somewhat disorganized, but if you take the time to pick out the important information, it is filled with interesting information. I have been on the diet for 48 hours and would love to hear from others who are on it or just starting it also. I feel a little tired right now which I am sure my body is having major withdrawl from carbs and soft drinks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to follow and inexpensive Diet!","review":"The only other diet that can compare to this one is from Herbalife. But unfortunately the later one is [more money]. On this diet there are no special products to buy and be forced to buy for life. No special pills, just regular vitamins. No needles injections and no ... gimmick to buy. The only products you need on this diet are at the supermarket, pharmacy and this inexpensive book.Now the easy side. There is no counting, measuring or whatever else the other diets need you to do. None of the [stuff] that makes you feel like you're on a diet.It's been almost 5 years and none of those 50 pounds have come back.Thank you Dr. Atkins! If it weren't for your book and wisdom I'd be probably needing insulin injections by now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"80 pounds in 1 year","review":"Need I say more? This diet works, is easy to follow and is a practical long-term lifestyle choice. I can't imagine how much more weight I would have gained if I had stayed on the low-fat, high-carb diet. Then a co-worker told me about the Atkins diet and I checked it out for myself. The weight came off extremely fast at first (50 pounds in three months) but slowed down as I started to add a few carbs back into my diet. I started exercising regularly after the first month or so and haven't stopped. I love the results. It's only a matter of time before government health officials get with the program and start advocating a low-carb diet. It seems that they're starting to."},{"rating":"2","title":"25 years on Atkins and still alive!","review":"I'm extremely carbo sensitive, insulin resistant. Atkins' Diet is important for those who've have parents, relatives with Type II diabetes. I feel better in ketosis. While I do eat carbos occasionally, after feeling lousy and gaining weight, back I'll go into ketosis. For those who have trouble with the diet, add l-glutamine. This amino acid helps with carbo withdrawal. If constipated, take psyllium husks. These plus more ideas are in the book. Many of the complaints I hear about the diet have easy solutions. I also have 25 years of excellent blood lipid results on a high fat, no/low carbo diet."},{"rating":"1","title":"What am I doing wrong???","review":"I began this book with many positive comments from friends and family! I faithfully read the pages with excitement, tossed my carbos and sugar treats and whole heartedly began my diet 9 days ago. I ate with caution and regarding every sentence of the directions and have lost nothing. The LTS strips showed heavy fat loss for 4 days, then nothing. The book says it could be a motabolism problem, but there is no explination as to what to do after following every direction fails. Help!! Where is the answer to this problem? It is not in the book that I can see."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Success","review":"After nudging from a coworker I tried this diet and I stayed on it for the entire 14 day induction period. I went into ketosis as promised but did not lose a single pound. It seems this diet works for some individuals-just did not work for me. I am athletic and work out 3-5 times a week lifting weights and rollerblading. This diet left me feeling sluggish. My coworker hower, has lost a great deal of weight using this diet-but has regained a bit and is now following the induction diet once again. Simply, this diet did not work for me although it seems to have worked for others."},{"rating":"2","title":"I lost weight when I couldn't before","review":"I was fed up of all these \\"great\\" diets I would try not working. I had been slowly gaining about 5 pounds each year. I'd been eating nothing but food that said it was low-fat and exercising, but that didn't make me lose weight. I got really depressed about it. People (especially family) would say I wasn't trying hard enough at it. I heard about this book through word of mouth and figured \\"why not? I've tried about everything else\\". I found myself relating to a lot of the questions he'd ask. After about the first or second chapter I realized that this diet was intended for someone like me. I'm really happy with the results I'm seeing. So far I've lost 10 pounds and my husband has lost weight too. I would definitely recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible way to live","review":"I tried to follow this diet, but on the fourth night I was awoke by painful leg cramps, and I had severe constipation. This was ended by eating all the fruit I could eat. Within 15 minutes the cramps and headache that I had since the second day went away, and I felt fantastic. The fat from the diet turned my stomach. On the plate was several pieces of greasy chicken, and a handful of lettuce, or the same greasy bacon and eggs for breakfast. If you want to lose weight the sane way check out the book \\"volumetrics\\". It really goes into detail about these fad diets, and the damage they can do. I learned my lesson with the atkins diet, and the only way to lose weight is portion control."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEVELOPED HEART DISEASE!","review":"I thought all these protein books were super until I got my annual exam and had my cholesterol level checked. It turned out it had become sky high and that I had made my heart disease worse! THIS BOOK IS NOT HEALTHY! Don't buy it. It's not worth risking your life for this scam book. The so-called \\"doctor\\" should be ashamed of himself. My personal doctor suggested a book by Gary Rempe and it worked really well and actually improved my health a lot in the process. Don't waste your money and your life on this book by Atkins."},{"rating":"1","title":"females lookout!","review":"I have been on this diet now for 2 weeks, lost 5 pounds and am having trouble.

Nothing but meat, cheese, eggs etc. This may sound like some kind of nirvana until you realise you can't eat buns with your burger (or fries), no taco shell with your taco, no base for your pizza, no bread for your sandwich...I feel I was missing out more than ever on this diet. But worst of all my bad \\"ldl\\" cholestrol went up, i suffered from headaches and dizziness most days, my breath stank and i was always constipated.Oh yes i lost some weight. And now i know why most people lose weight- you can only eat so much protein. By cutting off an entire food catergory you will, of course, lose weight- that's obvious.But i can assure you there are much healthier and in the long term more effective ways of losing weight. This diet really does stink!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey, has anyone out there checked their cholesterol lately?","review":"In January of '99 I had a complete blood work up. My total cholesterol was 230. Three weeks ago I began the Atkins diet. I loved it. Any why not? I got to eat cheese and meat ad nauseum (and I was frequently nauseated). Last week I had anothrt blood work-up: My cholesterol had skyrockerted nearly 50 points to 279! Now, as a rational human being I realize that only three weeks of the Atkins diet could not have been responsible for that huge jump in total cholesterol...but it sure as hell didn't help. Watch yourselves out there, folks. And have your cholesterol checked!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't take the Atkins steak-and-eggs bait! This diet is nuts","review":"Iam 38 years old and am about thirty pounds over my ideal weight. I tried the Atkins diet out of desperation after years of trying so many other diets. This sounded like the perfect diet for me. If I could eat meat and heavy cream and LOSE weight - COUNT ME IN! Maybe this diet works for those needing to lose 70lbs and more - but I LOST NO WEIGHT. I did not cheat at all. I followed the rules to the letter. Now I know Atkins says that there is a small percentage of people who will have this reaction, so I give him that. But the truth is, NO FAD DIETS WORK. If you want to read a good book - read Dr. Dean Edell's \\"EAT, DRINK, AND BE MERRY.\\" That book is a real wake up call for all of us seesaw dieters. It is so great to read a book that tells the truth - FINALLY - about dieting, exercise, and so many other health related topics."},{"rating":"1","title":"DANGEROUS DIET","review":"My cholesterol shot up more than 70 points on this diet, from 193 to 268. My doctor tells me I'm now at risk for heart attack and stroke, and I can only attribute this new health problem to this diet.
